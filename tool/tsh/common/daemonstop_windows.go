// onDaemonStop implements the "tsh daemon stop" command. It handles graceful shutdown of the daemon.
//
// teleterm.Serve listens to os.Interrupt and syscall.SIGTERM and stops the deamon when one of the
// signals is received. The Electron app starts the daemon and kills it with SIGTERM before the GUI
// app itself is closed.
//
// The problem is that Windows doesn't implement Unix signals. In Node.js, calling `subprocess.kill`
// on Windows is the equivalent of using SIGKILL to kill a process, giving it no chance to perform
// any kind of cleanup before exiting. [1]
//
// However, there is a way around this problem, as found on SO [2]. A process can attach itself to
// the console of another process. Then it can send a signal to the console which sends a signal to
// all processes attached to that console to shut down. In Go, that signal is represented as
// os.Interrupt. [3]
//
// Why do it in a separate tsh command instead of in the main JavaScript process which starts the
// tsh daemon? First, calling Windows APIs in Go is much easier. Second, sending CTRL_BREAK_EVENT
// sends os.Interrupt to _all_ processes attached to a particular console. We'd have to add special
// calls in Node.js to make the main process ignore that signal. Instead, we can just spawn a new
// process and not care about ignoring the signal.

	// We have to use CTRL_BREAK_EVENT instead of CTRL_C_EVENT here. For some reason, CTRL_C_EVENT

	//
	// It might be because CTRL_C_EVENT is received as a signal by default, but processes can use
	// SetConsoleCtrlHandler to receive CTRL_C_EVENT as keyboard input. [1] We didn't investigate if
	// this is what Electron does under the hood when using spawn, but rest assured we know that
	// CTRL_C_EVENT works here - as the docs say, it's always sent as a signal.
