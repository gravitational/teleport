  The proxy address format is host:https_port,ssh_proxy_port

  Passwordless only works in local auth
  --auth=passwordless flag can be omitted if your cluster configuration set the connector_name: passwordless option.

EXAMPLES:
  Use ports 8080 and 8023 for https and SSH proxy:
  $ tsh --proxy=host.example.com:8080,8023 login

  Use port 8080 and 3023 (default) for SSH proxy:
  $ tsh --proxy=host.example.com:8080 login

  Login and select cluster "two":
  $ tsh --proxy=host.example.com login two

  Select cluster "two" using existing credentials and proxy:
  $ tsh login two

  For passwordless authentication use:
  $ tsh login --auth=passwordless`

Examples:
  Search databases with keywords:
  $ tsh db ls --search foo,bar

  Filter databases with labels:
  $ tsh db ls key1=value1,key2=value2

  List databases from all clusters with extra fields:
  $ tsh db ls --all -v

  Get database names using "jq":
  $ tsh db ls --format json  | jq -r '.[].metadata.name'`
