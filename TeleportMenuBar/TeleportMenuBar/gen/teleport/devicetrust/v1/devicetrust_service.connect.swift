/// DeviceTrustService provides methods to manage, enroll and authenticate
/// trusted devices.
///
/// A trusted device is a device that is registered and enrolled with Teleport,
/// thus allowing the system to provide some guarantees about its provenance and
/// state.
///
/// Managing devices requires the corresponding CRUD "device" permission.
/// Additionally, creating enrollment tokens requires the "create_enroll_token"
/// permission and enrolling devices requires the "enroll" permission. See
/// CreateDevice, CreateDeviceEnrollToken and EnrollDevice for reference.
///
/// An authenticated, trusted device allows its user to perform device-aware
/// actions. Such actions include accessing an SSH node, managing sensitive
/// resources via `tctl`, etc. The enforcement mode is defined via cluster-wide
/// and/or per-role toggles. Device authentication is automatic for enrolled
/// devices communicating with Enterprise clusters. See AuthenticateDevice for
/// reference.
///
/// Device Trust is a Teleport Enterprise feature. Open Source Teleport clusters
/// treat all Device RPCs as unimplemented (which, in fact, they are for OSS.)
