# RFD 0231 - In-Band MFA for SSH Sessions

## Required Approvers

- Engineering: @rosstimothy && @espadolini && @fspmarshall
- Product: @klizhentas
- Security: @rob-picard-teleport

## What

This RFD proposes integrating in-band multi-factor authentication (MFA) into SSH session establishment with the Teleport
SSH service. This change aims to enhance security by ensuring that MFA checks are tightly coupled with session creation,
reducing client complexity, and eliminating the need for per-session MFA SSH certificates.

## Why

Teleportâ€™s current approach to per-session MFA enforcement for SSH access has several architectural and security
shortcomings that this proposal aims to address:

1. Per-session MFA enforcement flow is performed separately from session creation (i.e., out-of-band), which can
   introduce security gaps. For example, in
   [CVE-2025-49825](https://github.com/gravitational/Teleport/security/advisories/GHSA-8cqv-pj7f-pwpc), the MFA
   enforcement policy can be bypassed since an attacker had the ability to forge a certificate attesting that they had
   completed MFA and there was no proper binding between the certificate and the session.
1. MFA complexity is concentrated on the client versus the server. The client is responsible for determining MFA
   requirements, generating an MFA challenge, requesting a per-session MFA certificate and finally dialing a target host
   with the per-session MFA certificate. This complexity increases the risk of implementation errors and inconsistencies
   across different clients (e.g., `tsh`, web terminal, Teleport Connect, etc.).
1. A per-session MFA certificate is a single credential, representing multiple factors of authentication for a user. If
   an attacker were to gain possession, it could be used to bypass all forms of authentication checks, including MFA.

By moving MFA enforcement to the SSH service during session establishment, this new design directly addresses the above
issues by:

1. MFA enforcement is tightly integrated with session creation (i.e., in-band), ensuring that authentication factors are
   directly bound to each session and mitigating the risk of bypasses like those seen in
   [CVE-2025-49825](https://github.com/gravitational/Teleport/security/advisories/GHSA-8cqv-pj7f-pwpc).
1. MFA complexity is moved from clients to the SSH service, so clients only need to connect to the SSH service and
   resolve an MFA challenge only if required, streamlining the session establishment process and reducing the risk of
   implementation errors.
1. Per-session MFA certificates can be completely removed, eliminating a single credential representing multiple factors
   of authentication.

In summary, this RFD proposes a more secure and streamlined approach to MFA enforcement for SSH sessions by integrating
MFA checks directly into the session establishment process, reducing client complexity, and eliminating the need for
per-session MFA certificates.

## Non-Goals

1. This RFD does not propose changes to other Teleport access protocols such as Kubernetes, databases, desktops, etc.
   However, the architecture could be extended to these protocols in the future.

## Details

### UX

No changes are expected since this is an internal change.

### High-Level Flow

The client will first dial its target SSH host using the Proxy and its standard Teleport client certificate. The Proxy
will then resolve the target cluster and host, and invoke the `EvaluateSSHAccess` RPC of the Decision service. Upon
receiving a permit from the Decision service, the Proxy will staple the permit to the connection and open a connection
to the respective cluster's SSH service.

The SSH service will authenticate the client using the provided client certificate and the stapled permit. The SSH
service will then check if MFA is required for the session by examining the permit.

If MFA is _not required_, the SSH service will then proceed to establish the SSH session.

If MFA _is required_, the SSH service will send a JSON-encoded question containing the action ID via the SSH
[keyboard-interactive channel](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4256) to inform the client that MFA is needed. An
action ID is a unique identifier (UUID v4) that [ties the MFA challenge to a specific user
action](#associating-mfa-challenges-with-user-actions) (in this case, SSH session establishment). In the future, action
IDs could be used for other Teleport features beyond SSH access.

The MFA keyboard-interactive question will follow this schema:

```json
{
  // Unique identifier for the MFA action (UUID v4).
  "action_id": "121c49ab-8bc1-414a-b11c-5311bc54eceb",
  // Human-readable message to display to the user.
  "message": "MFA required. Complete the challenge using the provided action ID."
}
```

The client must then invoke the `CreateChallengeForAction` RPC of the MFA service, providing the action ID along with
any relevant request metadata. The MFA service will respond to the client with a challenge that must be solved. The
client must solve the MFA challenge and send a base64 encoded `MFAAuthenticateResponse` message to the SSH service via
the keyboard-interactive channel. The Protobuf message must be base64 encoded to ensure they can be safely transmitted
over the SSH keyboard-interactive channel.

Once the MFA challenge response is received, the SSH service will invoke the `ValidateChallengeForAction` RPC with the
action ID, the client's MFA challenge response, and any other relevant metadata. If the MFA response is valid and the
action ID matches the expected value, the SSH service will proceed to establish the SSH session. If the MFA response is
invalid, the SSH service will deny the connection with an `Access Denied: Invalid MFA response` error.

If the client fails to complete the MFA challenge within a specified timeout (e.g., default 1 minute), the SSH service
will terminate the connection with an `Access Denied: MFA verification timed out` error. If the client wishes to retry,
it must initiate a new SSH connection.

### Security

In addition to the risks raised in [Access Control Decision API (RFD
0024e)](https://github.com/gravitational/Teleport.e/blob/master/rfd/0024e-access-control-decision-api.md), there are a
few risks specific to this RFD.

#### Replay Attacks Risk

MFA challenge responses could potentially be captured and replayed by an attacker to gain unauthorized access. Although
this risk has already existed using per-session MFA SSH certificates, it is important to address it in the new design as
well.

Mitigations:

1. Each MFA challenge will include a unique action ID that couples the challenge to a specific user action.
1. The MFA service will [maintain a record](#associating-mfa-challenges-with-user-actions) of issued challenges and
   their associated action IDs. Once a challenge has been successfully completed or expired, it will be invalidated.
1. The MFA challenge is time-bound and will expire after a duration (e.g., 5 minutes).

#### New RPCs Attack Surface Risk

This RFD introduces two new RPCs `CreateChallengeForAction` and `ValidateChallengeForAction` in the MFA service, which
could potentially be exploited by an attacker to DoS the service by flooding it with requests.

Mitigations:

1. Only authenticated clients are authorized to call the `CreateChallengeForAction` RPC, requests from other sources
   will be rejected.
1. Only Teleport instances are authorized to call the `ValidateChallengeForAction` RPC, requests from other sources will
   be rejected.
1. Ensure that the MFA service validates the `MFAAuthenticateResponse` and action ID before processing the request to
   avoid unnecessary processing of invalid requests.

### Privacy

No changes to privacy are expected.

### Proto Specification

#### Decision Service

The Decision service will return a new field called `preconditions` in `SSHAccessPermit` to indicate that MFA is a
condition of access. It is up to the SSH service to enforce the MFA requirement during session establishment.

```proto
// SSHAccessPermit describes the parameters/constraints of a permissible SSH
// access attempt.
message SSHAccessPermit {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Preconditions is a list of conditions that must be satisfied before access is granted.
 repeated Precondition preconditions = 26;
}

// PreconditionKind defines the types of preconditions that can be specified.
enum PreconditionKind {
  // PreconditionKindUnspecified is an unspecified precondition. This value has no effect.
  PRECONDITION_KIND_UNSPECIFIED = 0;
  // PreconditionKindPerSessionMFA requires per-session MFA to be completed.
  PRECONDITION_KIND_PER_SESSION_MFA = 1;
}

// Precondition represents a condition that must be satisfied before access is granted.
message Precondition {
  // Kind specifies the type of precondition.
  PreconditionKind kind = 1;
}
```

#### MFA Service

A new gRPC service `MFAService` will be created to encapsulate MFA-related RPCs, separating them from the legacy
`AuthService`. In the future, all new MFA-related RPCs should be added to this service and existing MFA-related RPCs in
the `AuthService` should be gradually migrated to `MFAService`.

A new service was opted to be created instead of extending/adding new RPCs to the existing `AuthService` to maintain
clear separation of concerns and to avoid continuing to bloat the `AuthService` with more responsibilities and
complexity. Additionally, the RPCs defined in this new service are specifically focused on MFA challenges for user
actions, instead of further expanding the existing `CreateAuthenticateChallenge` RPC which is more general-purpose.

It will implement the following RPC and messages for creating and validating MFA challenges tied to specific user
actions:

```proto
// MFAService defines the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) service. New MFA related RPCs should be added here instead
// of the AuthService.
service MFAService {
  // CreateChallengeForAction creates an MFA challenge that is tied to a specific user action. The action_id is required
  // and the created challenge will be correlated to that action.
  rpc CreateChallengeForAction(CreateChallengeForActionRequest) returns (CreateChallengeForActionResponse);
  // ValidateChallengeForAction validates the MFA challenge response provided by the user for a specific user action.
  // The action_id is required and must match the action the challenge was created for.
  rpc ValidateChallengeForAction(ValidateChallengeForActionRequest) returns (ValidateChallengeForActionResponse);
}

// CreateChallengeForActionRequest is the request message for CreateChallengeForAction.
message CreateChallengeForActionRequest {
  // action_id is a required unique identifier associated with the MFA challenge. The challenge will be correlated to a
  // specific user action based on this ID. This field MUST be a UUID v4 (RFC 4122, version 4).
  string action_id = 1;
  // user is the username of the user attempting to authenticate.
  string user = 2;
  // sso_client_redirect_url should be supplied if the client supports SSO MFA checks. If unset, the server will only
  // return non-SSO challenges.
  string sso_client_redirect_url = 3;
  // proxy_address is the proxy address that the user is using to connect to the Proxy. When using SSO MFA, this address
  // is required to determine which URL to redirect the user to when there are multiple options.
  string proxy_address = 4;
}

// CreateChallengeForActionResponse is the response message for CreateChallengeForAction.
message CreateChallengeForActionResponse {
  // action_id is the unique identifier associated with the MFA challenge. It indicates which action the
  // challenge/response will be tied to. This field MUST be a UUID v4 (RFC 4122, version 4).
  string action_id = 1;
  // mfa_challenge contains the MFA challenge that the user must respond to.
  MFAAuthenticateChallenge mfa_challenge = 2;
}

// ValidateChallengeForActionRequest is the request message for ValidateChallengeForAction.
message ValidateChallengeForActionRequest {
  // action_id is a required unique identifier associated with the MFA challenge. It validates that the challenge and
  // response are tied to a specific user action. This field MUST be a UUID v4 (RFC 4122, version 4).
  string action_id = 1;
  // mfa_response contains the MFA challenge response provided by the user.
  MFAAuthenticateResponse mfa_response = 2;
  // user is the username of the user attempting to authenticate.
  string user = 3;
}

// ValidateChallengeForActionResponse is the response message for ValidateChallengeForAction.
message ValidateChallengeForActionResponse {
  // action_id is the unique identifier associated with the MFA challenge. It indicates which action the
  // challenge/response was tied to. This field MUST be a UUID v4 (RFC 4122, version 4).
  string action_id = 1;
  // user is the username of the user authenticated by the MFA challenge.
  string user = 2;
  // device contains information about the user's MFA device used to authenticate.
  types.MFADevice device = 3;
}

// MFAAuthenticateChallenge is a challenge for all MFA devices registered for a user.
message MFAAuthenticateChallenge {
  // webauthn_challenge contains a Webauthn credential assertion used for login/authentication ceremonies. Credential
  // assertions hold, among other information, a list of allowed credentials for the ceremony (one for each U2F or
  // Webauthn device registered by the user).
  webauthn.CredentialAssertion webauthn_challenge = 1;
  // sso_challenge is an SSO MFA challenge. If set, the client can go to the IdP redirect URL to perform an MFA check in
  // the IdP and obtain an MFA token. This token paired with the request id can then be used as MFA verification.
  SSOChallenge sso_challenge = 2;
}

// MFAAuthenticateResponse is a response to MFAAuthenticateChallenge using one of the MFA devices registered for a user.
message MFAAuthenticateResponse {
  oneof response {
    // webauthn is a response to a Webauthn challenge.
    webauthn.CredentialAssertionResponse webauthn = 1;
    // sso is a response to an SSO challenge.
    SSOChallengeResponse sso = 2;
  }
}

// SSOChallenge contains SSO auth request details to perform an SSO MFA check.
message SSOChallenge {
  // request_id is the ID of an SSO auth request.
  string request_id = 1;
  // redirect_url is an IdP redirect URL to initiate the SSO MFA flow.
  string redirect_url = 2;
  // device is the SSO device corresponding to the challenge.
  types.SSOMFADevice device = 3;
}

// SSOChallengeResponse is a response to SSOChallenge.
message SSOChallengeResponse {
  // request_id is the ID of an SSO auth request.
  string request_id = 1;
  // token is a secret token used to verify the user's SSO MFA session.
  string token = 2;
}
```

##### Associating MFA Challenges with User Actions

To associate MFA challenges with specific user actions, a new session data struct is introduced for each MFA method,
scoped specifically for action-related MFA challenges. These structs are used only for challenges created via the
`CreateChallengeForAction` RPC and are stored in the backend with the associated action ID.

New structs are chosen to ensure that action-related MFA challenges are clearly separated from legacy session data. The
structs model the legacy session data while omitting fields that are not relevant for action-scoped MFA challenges
(e.g., Challenge extensions). The new structs will have explicit CRUD operations that model the legacy session data
(e.g., key format, TTL handling, etc.).

When the `ValidateChallengeForAction` RPC is called, the action ID is used in combination with the user information to
retrieve the corresponding action-scoped MFA session data. This ensures that the MFA challenge response is validated
against the correct context.

###### WebAuthn Action Challenges

A new `WebAuthnActionSessionData` struct is defined to encapsulate the action ID and relevant WebAuthn session
information for action-scoped MFA challenges.

```go
// WebAuthnActionSessionData stores session data for WebAuthn MFA challenges tied to a specific user action.
type WebAuthnActionSessionData struct {
  // ActionID is the MFA action ID associated with this session.
  ActionID string `json:"action_id"`
  // Raw challenge used for the ceremony.
  Challenge []byte `json:"challenge,omitempty"`
  // Raw User ID.
  UserID []byte `json:"userId,omitempty"`
  // Raw Credential IDs of the credentials allowed for the ceremony.
  AllowCredentials [][]byte `json:"allowCredentials,omitempty"`
  // True if resident keys were required by the server / Relying Party.
  ResidentKey bool `json:"residentKey,omitempty"`
  // Requested user verification requirement, either "discouraged" or
  // "required".
  // An empty value is treated equivalently to "discouraged".
  UserVerification string `json:"userVerification,omitempty"`
}
```

###### SSO Action Challenges

A new `SSOMFAActionSessionData` struct is defined to encapsulate the action ID and relevant SSO MFA session information
for action-scoped MFA challenges.

```go
// SSOMFAActionSessionData stores session data for SSO MFA challenges tied to a specific user action.
type SSOMFAActionSessionData struct {
  // ActionID is the MFA action ID associated with this session.
  ActionID string `json:"action_id"`
  // RequestID is the ID of the corresponding SSO Auth request, which is used to
  // identify this session.
  RequestID string `json:"request_id,omitempty"`
  // Username is the Teleport username.
  Username string `json:"username,omitempty"`
  // Token is an active token used to verify the owner of this SSO MFA session data.
  Token string `json:"token,omitempty"`
  // ConnectorID is id of the corresponding Auth connector.
  ConnectorID string `json:"connector_id,omitempty"`
  // ConnectorType is SSO type of the corresponding Auth connector (SAML, OIDC).
  ConnectorType string `json:"connector_type,omitempty"`
}
```

### Backwards Compatibility

#### Terminology

- Legacy clients: Clients that rely on per-session MFA SSH certificates for MFA enforcement.
- Modern clients: Clients that support in-band MFA enforcement and do not rely on per-session MFA SSH certificates.
- Legacy agents: Agents hosting the SSH service that rely on per-session MFA SSH certificates for MFA enforcement.
- Modern agents: Agents hosting the SSH service that support in-band MFA enforcement and do not rely on per-session MFA
  SSH certificates.

#### Transition Period

The transition period will cover only two consecutive major releases: the current release (N) and the immediately
previous release (N-1). During this period components must support both the legacy perâ€‘session MFA certificate flow and
the new inâ€‘band MFA flow for compatibility between N and N-1. The transition ends with the next major release (N+1),
after which all components must support the inâ€‘band MFA flow exclusively.

Example: if this RFD is implemented in Teleport 20.0.0, the transition period covers releases 20.x and 19.x and will end
with the release of 21.0.0. Starting with 21.0.0, all components must support inâ€‘band MFA enforcement only.

This transition period might be too long for some environments that want to enforce in-band MFA sooner for improved
security. To accommodate these environments, an [opt-out flag](#early-adopters--opt-out-flag) will be provided to allow
early adopters to enable in-band MFA enforcement before the end of the transition period.

#### SSH Service

The SSH service will continue to support legacy clients that rely on per-session MFA SSH certificates during the
transition period, while modern clients will be _required_ to use the in-band MFA flow.

The following diagram depicts the SSH connection flow during the transition period, with a focus on MFA enforcement:

```mermaid
---
title: SSH MFA Connection Flow During Transition Period
---
flowchart TD
  NewConn[New SSH connection] --> VerifyCert[Verify client cert]
  VerifyCert -- Valid --> CheckMFA{MFA required?}
  VerifyCert -- Invalid --> RejectCert[Reject: invalid cert]
  RejectCert --> End[End]

  CheckMFA{MFA required?}
  CheckMFA -- No --> AcceptAll[Accept connection]
  CheckMFA -- Yes --> CertType{Is cert a MFA cert?}
  CertType -- Yes --> ValidatePS[Validate MFA cert]
  ValidatePS -- Valid --> AcceptAll[Accept connection]
  ValidatePS -- Invalid --> RejectPS[Reject: invalid MFA cert]
  RejectPS --> End[End]

  CertType -- No --> LegacyCheck{Is legacy client?}
  LegacyCheck -- Yes --> RejectLegacy[Reject: must use MFA cert]
  RejectLegacy --> End[End]
  LegacyCheck -- No --> InBand[Proceed with in-band MFA]
  InBand -- Valid --> AcceptAll[Accept connection]
  InBand -- Invalid --> RejectInBand[Reject: invalid MFA response]
  RejectInBand --> End[End]

  AcceptAll --> End[End]
```

After the transition period, the SSH service will no longer accept per-session MFA SSH certificates and will only
support the in-band MFA flow.

#### Modern Clients and Legacy Agents

Modern clients will support legacy agents that rely on per-session MFA SSH certificates during the transition period.

Modern clients will generate per-session MFA SSH certificates for legacy agents while using the in-band MFA flow for
modern agents.

#### Early Adopters / Opt-Out Flag

Use the environment variable `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_FORCE_INBAND_MFA` to force exclusive use of the inâ€‘band MFA flow for
testing and early adoption.

For environments deploying a fresh Teleport cluster during the transition period, it is recommended to enable this flag
to ensure that all components use the inâ€‘band MFA flow from the start.

To enable the flag, set the environment variable to `yes`. To disable the flag, unset the environment variable.

When set on modern clients: the client will not request per-session MFA certificates and will use the inâ€‘band MFA flow.

When set on modern agents: the SSH service will reject per-session MFA certificates and require inâ€‘band MFA for
connections that need MFA. Additionally, clients will no longer be able to request per-session MFA certificates from the
Auth service.

> Warning: intended for testing/early adopters only. Enabling this will break connections from legacy clients or legacy
> agents that still rely on per-session MFA certificates. Remove the flag once the environment has completed migration
> to the inâ€‘band flow.

Once the transition period is over, the flag will be removed and modern clients and agents will exclusively use the
inâ€‘band MFA flow.

### Audit Events

The RPCs defined in the [MFA service](#mfa-service) will emit audit events for creating and validating MFA challenges
tied to specific user actions. No other changes to audit events are expected as they are already covered by existing
events (e.g., SSH access).

```proto
// CreateMFAChallengeForAction records the creation of an MFA auth challenge.
message CreateMFAChallengeForAction {
  // Metadata is a common event metadata.
  Metadata Metadata = 1 [
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false,
    (gogoproto.embed) = true,
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = ""
  ];

  // User is a common user event metadata.
  UserMetadata User = 2 [
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false,
    (gogoproto.embed) = true,
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = ""
  ];

  // ActionID is the ID of the action requiring MFA.
  string ActionID = 3 [(gogoproto.jsontag) = "action_id"];
}

// ValidateMFAChallengeForAction records the validation of an MFA auth challenge response.
message ValidateMFAChallengeForAction {
  // Metadata is a common event metadata.
  Metadata Metadata = 1 [
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false,
    (gogoproto.embed) = true,
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = ""
  ];

  // User is a common user event metadata.
  UserMetadata User = 2 [
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false,
    (gogoproto.embed) = true,
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = ""
  ];

  // Status contains common command or operation status fields
  Status Status = 3 [
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false,
    (gogoproto.embed) = true,
    (gogoproto.jsontag) = ""
  ];

  // MFADevice is the MFA device used.
  MFADeviceMetadata MFADevice = 4 [(gogoproto.jsontag) = "mfa_device,omitempty"];

  // ActionID is the ID of the action requiring MFA.
  string ActionID = 5 [(gogoproto.jsontag) = "action_id"];
}
```

### Observability

No changes to observability patterns are needed.

### Product Usage

No changes in product usage are expected since this is an internal change.

### Test Plan

### Existing Tests

Existing tests for SSH access are expected to continue working as this is an internal change and should not have any
impact.

### New Tests

During the transition period, tests will be added to ensure that both legacy and modern clients can connect to both
legacy and modern agents as expected.

After the transition period, tests will be added to ensure that modern clients can connect to modern agents using the
in-band MFA flow and that legacy clients are rejected when attempting to connect to modern agents.

### Implementation

#### Dependencies

The following are assumed to be completed before starting work on this RFD:

1. [Access Control Decision API (RFD
   0024e)](https://github.com/gravitational/Teleport.e/blob/master/rfd/0024e-access-control-decision-api.md) refactor
   and relocate implementation
   1. Decision service has a way for deriving user/session metadata from incoming requests without relying on client
      certificates.
   1. `EvaluateSSHAccess` RPC should no longer return an error if MFA is required but not satisfied. A parameter in the
      permit should indicate whether MFA is required for access.
   1. The Proxy service is updated to staple the permit returned by the Decision service to the proxied SSH connection.

#### Phase 1 (Transition Period - at least 2 major releases)

1. Update the Decision service to return a permit containing a `preconditions` field.
1. Add `MFAService` to support creating and validating MFA challenges tied to specific user actions.
1. Update the SSH service to implement the in-band MFA flow during session establishment.
1. Update the SSH service auth handler to use `VerifiedPublicKeyCallback` instead of `PublicKeyCallback` to ensure that
   the client has confirmed possession of the private key associated with the client certificate.
1. Update modern clients to support the in-band MFA flow while still supporting per-session MFA SSH certificates for
   legacy agents.
1. Update modern agents to support the in-band MFA flow while still supporting per-session MFA SSH certificates for
   legacy clients.
1. Add tests to ensure both legacy and modern clients can connect to both legacy and modern agents as expected.
1. Audit events are emitted for the new `MFAService` RPCs.

#### Phase 2 (Post Transition Period - after at least 2 major releases)

1. Update the SSH service to no longer accept per-session MFA SSH certificates and only support the in-band MFA flow.
1. Update clients to no longer generate per-session MFA SSH certificates.
1. Update tests to remove support for legacy clients and agents.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Proxy/Relay facilitates the entire MFA ceremony: In this approach, the Proxy/Relay would handle the entire MFA flow,
   including creating the MFA challenge and validating the response. While this would still simplify the client-side
   implementation, it would potentially introduce security risks by giving Proxy/Relay access to operations that are out
   of its domain scope.
1. New version of `TransportService` is introduced to handle in-band MFA at the Proxy/Relay: While this would separate
   concerns and keep the MFA logic isolated, it would add complexity to the architecture, require significant changes to
   existing services, and break domain boundaries.

## Future Considerations

1. Extend in-band MFA enforcement to additional protocols e.g., Kubernetes API requests, database connections, desktop
   access, etc.
