RFD 202 - Database Multi-session MFA

Required Approvers:
- Engineering: @r0mant && (@rosstimothy || @Joerger)

## What

Allows executing multiple database connections with a single MFA tap.

## Why

Teleport today supports per-session MFA for enhanced security. However, when a
user needs to run queries on multiple database hosts simultaneously, they have
to perform a tap for every connection.


User session MFA for this particular situation will be relaxed so that an MFA
challenge is still required for connecting to target databases but the MFA
response can be reused for a short period of time without the need to prompt the
user again in that period.

In addition to expanding MFA functionalities, a new `tsh` command will be
introduced to assist executing queries on multiple database servers using a
single CLI command.

## Details

#### UX - basic "tsh db exec"

I want to execute a database query on multiple database services without being
prompted by MFA for every database service:
```bash
$ tsh db exec "select @@hostname" --db-user mysql --dbs mysql-db1,mysql-db2
MFA is required to execute database sessions
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap

Executing command for 'mysql-db1':
@@hostname
mysql-db1-hostname

Executing command for 'mysql-db2':
@@hostname
mysql-db2-hostname
```

The query is executed sequentially and the outputs are printed sequentially.

The cached MFA response does not persist through the command so 
a new MFA challenge is expected when running another `tsh db exec` command.

#### UX - concurrent connections with "tsh db exec"

I would like to search databases by labels, and run the sql script in parallel:
```bash
$ tsh db exec "source my_script.sql" --labels env=dev --db-user mysql --output-dir exec-logs --max-connections 3
Found 5 databases:

Name      Protocol Description Labels
--------- -------- ----------- -------
mysql-db1 mysql    instance 1  env=dev
mysql-db2 mysql    instance 2  env=dev
mysql-db3 mysql    instance 3  env=dev
mysql-db4 mysql    instance 4  env=dev
mysql-db5 mysql    instance 5  env=dev

Do you want to continue?  [y/N]: y

MFA is required to execute database sessions
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap

Executing command for 'mysql-db1'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db1.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db2'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db2.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db3'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db3.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db4'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db4.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db5'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db5.log'.
```
Where you can expect the first 3 connections happen right away, and the other 2
connections happen after the previous ones finish.

#### UX - long sessions with multi-session MFA

I need to execute a query on a large number databases and total sessions can
last longer than 5 minutes (the validity period of the cached WebAuthn
response):

```bash
$ tsh db exec "source my_script.sql" --labels env=staging --db-user mysql --output-dir exec-logs
Found 9 databases:
...

MFA is required to execute database sessions
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap

Executing command for 'mysql-db1'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db1.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db2'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db2.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db3'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db3.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db4'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db4.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db5'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db5.log'.

Your MFA session has expired. Start a new MFA session to execute database sessions
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap

Executing command for 'mysql-db6'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db6.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db7'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db7.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db8'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db8.log'.
Executing command for 'mysql-db9'. Logs will be saved at 'exec-logs/mysql-db9.log'.
```
Where a new MFA prompt will be required when the cached MFA response is expired.

            tsh ->> Teleport: WebAuthn login
            Teleport ->> tsh: MFA Response
            tsh ->> Teleport: GenerateUserCerts with MFA response
            Teleport ->> tsh: User cert with database route
        else IsMFARequired required, but can reuse MFA response
            tsh ->> Teleport: GenerateUserCerts with cached MFA response
            Teleport ->> tsh: User cert with database route
        end

        tsh <<->> Teleport: database connection with TLS routing
        tsh ->> user: output
    end
```

In favor of better UX, no new role option is introduced for multi-session MFA.
The multi-session MFA extends [RFD 155 Scoped Webauthn
Credentials](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0155-scoped-webauthn-credentials.md)
by allowing reuse for `ChallengeScope_CHALLENGE_SCOPE_USER_SESSION`.

Similar to `SCOPE_ADMIN_ACTION`, `ChallengeScope_CHALLENGE_SCOPE_USER_SESSION`
now can be requested with `CHALLENGE_ALLOW_REUSE_YES`. The responded session data
will be reusable until it expires. Clients must go through MFA ceremony again if
it expires, and expired session can be detected by expecting specific errors
from `GenerateUserCerts`.

Currently, reuse of the session data is allowed within 5 minutes.
This duration is hard-coded and controlled on the server side. We could
introduce a new option to override the period but leaving it out of scope for
this RFD for now.

The reusable MFA response will be checked upon auth call of `GenerateUserCerts`
where user requests a TLS user cert with database route. New logic is added to
`GenerateUserCerts` when the request is identified from `tsh db exec` sessions:

```diff
// Requester is the name of the service that sent the request.
 enum Requester {
...
    // TSH_APP_LOCAL_PROXY is set when the request was sent by a tsh app local proxy.
    TSH_APP_LOCAL_PROXY = 4;
+   // TSH_DB_EXEC is set when the request was sent by "tsh db exec".
+   TSH_DB_EXEC = 5;
}
```

And here goes the logic for handling `TSH_DB_EXEC`:
- The purpose must be single use and TTL is constrained to single use TTL of one
  minute.
- The request must be for a database route and not for any other resources.
- `CHALLENGE_ALLOW_REUSE_YES` when validating the MFA response.

Here is a matrix of different modes that `tsh` can request for user certs when
session MFA is required:

| Command          | Reusable  | Cert TTL                                                        |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tsh db connect` | no        | 1 minute                                                        |
| `tsh proxy db`   | no        | min(identity.expires, `role.options.mfa_verification_interval`) |
| `tsh db exec`    | 5 minutes | 1 minute                                                        |


### The `tsh db exec` command

General flow of the command:
- Create auth client which should be reused for all API calls.
- Fetch databases (either specified directly or through search).
- For each database:
  - Check MFA requirement:
    - No MFA prompt if not required.
    - MFA prompt if `per_session` MFA is required.
    - MFA prompt if first time requesting MFA for `multi_session` or cached
      `multi_session` response has expired.
  - Starts a local proxy in tunnel mode for this database (regardless of cluster
    proxy listener mode).
  - Craft a command for `os.exec`.
    - Outputs are printed to `stdout` unless `--output-dir` is specified
    - Outputs to `stdout` are prefixed with `[db-service-name] ` when
      `--max-connections` is greater than 1. The prefix behavior can be overridden
      with `--output-prefix/--no-output-prefix`.
  - Execute the command.
 
The command supports searching database by specifying one the following flags:
- `--search`: List of comma separated search keywords or phrases enclosed in
  quotations, e.g. `--search=foo,bar`.
- `--labels`: List of comma separated labels to filter by labels, e.g.
  `key1=value1,key2=value2`.
- `--query` will NOT be supported for this command as it is harder to use than
  the other options and the name `--query` may be confused with the database
  query that needs to be executed.

The command presents the search results then asks user to confirm before
proceeding. `--skip-confirm` can be used to skip the confirmation.

If no search parameters are used, a list of database names can be specified
through `--dbs db1,db2,...`.

For the MVP implementation, only PostgreSQL and MySQL databases will be
supported. And a warning will be printed if the target databases have different
protocols (e.g. `postgres` vs `mysql`).

Concurrent database connections can be run with `--max-connections` flag.
`--max-connections` defaults to 1, and must be <= 10 to avoid DDoSing the
backend.
 
#### Possible future enhancements for `tsh db exec`
- `tsh db exec --exec-config` to support a config file which allows specifying
  different flags like `--db-user`, `--db-name`, `--exec-query` per target
  database or per search.
- `tsh db exec --command-template` to support custom command template like `tsh
  db exec --exec-command "bash -c './my_script.sh {{.DB_SERVICE}} {{.DB_USER}}
  {{.DB_NAME}} {{.DB_LOCAL_PORT}}'"`. An env var
  `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_DB_EXEC_COMMAND` can be supported for the initial MVP.

### Security

Negative implications of the reusable scope is the same as outlined in [RFD 155
Scoped Webauthn
Credentials](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0155-scoped-webauthn-credentials.md):

1. The webauthn credential's scope is provided by the client
2. Reuse is requested by the client
3. Reuse is permitted for the action - server enforced
4. The expiration of the credentials - server enforced (5 minutes)

To limit this impact, the reusable MFA response will be only allowed when
requester is `TSH_DB_EXEC` and certs TTLs will be limited to 1 minute.
The logic for existing flows like `tsh db connect` or `tsh proxy db` [RFD
090](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0090-db-mfa-sessions.md)
will stay the same where only non-reusable response is allowed when calling
`GenerateUserCerts`.

Regardless, the original goal of per-session MFA, to protect users against
compromises of their on-disk Teleport certificates, is still preserved.

The `--max-connections` flag from `tsh db exec` has a max limit of 10, but it
will not prevent bad actors who attempt to flood the backend. However, this is
a general problem that applies outside of this RFD as well. A
`role.options.max_db_connections` will introduced separately to limit max
in-flight database sessions per user.
