# RFD 89 - Merge Webapps into Teleport

## Required Approvers

- Engineering: `@kimlisa`, `@ravicious`, `@nklaassen`

## What

- Merge the [webapps](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps) repo into the
  [teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) repo.
- Merge the [webapps.e](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps.e) repo into
  the [teleport.e](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.e) repo.

## Why

The version of the web UI and the Teleport are tightly coupled but the
repositories were created separate to support both Gravity and Teleport. This
introduced complexities when integrating the two projects.

We have to separately clone and build the web UI and commit the webasset
changes into the teleport repo whenever we want to represent an update. We also
have to maintain multiple build systems and ops procedures for the web UI.

Now that Gravity is no longer a product we develop, moving the web UI
repositories into their respective Teleport repo will save us time and
confusion.

## Success Criteria

Both [Teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) and
[Teleport.e](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.e) repos contain their
respective UI counterparts and the build systems correctly build all projects.

## Developer Experience

### Day to day

The Day to day development experience shouldn't change. The webapps project
will continue to be self-contained and only require access to the nodejs and
yarn binaries.

To work on the enterprise version of the application the developer will have to
check out the enterprise version of Teleport which will bring with it the
appropriate UI assets.

Merging these repositories may cause some disruption when multiple developers
are working on the same feature across the back and frontend. Using a
[git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) to create a worktree of
the webapps folder is an elegant way of approaching this issue

### Backports

To avoid having different processes and build systems depending on the version
of teleport, all supported release branches (v10, v11, v12) will have their
respective versions of the webapps repository merged.

### Build process

The Teleport build process will need to be expanded to include nodejs and yarn
in order to be able to build the webapp assets and include into the final
teleport binaries. We will no longer be committing a compiled version of the
webassets into the teleport repository, the UI will need to be compiled from
source on the initial build of teleport. A make target will be provided to
perform a dockerized build of the webassets for those who don't wish to install
node and yarn on their workstation.

### Merging PRs

At the time of writing, the `webapps` project sees about 1.5 pull requests per
day into the `master` branch. The `webapps` CI jobs take at most 11 minutes to
run. We expect the merging of the two projects to delay the merging of backend
branches by 30m in the event a `webapps` PR lands while a `teleport` PR is
running its own CI jobs. This is primarily caused by the length of the CI run
for `teleport` and as such there are some tasks to improve the performance of
these jobs listed in the `Process` section below.

The `teleport` repository now has a merge queue which dramatically reduced the
hand-holding require to sheppard a PR through. The CI tasks have also been
migrated to Github Actions which has reduced the total run time considerably.

## Process

Below outlines the process for each repository in the order that the steps need
to be taken. All repositories will be prepped for the final archival and merging
but the final switch over steps will not be taken until v11 has been released.

The git histories of each branch will be maintained while merging.

### Step by step merge instructions

install https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo into path

```
mkdir teleport-merge
cd teleport-merge
```

Checkout the v12 branches when doing v12 (v11, etc).

```
git clone git@github.com:gravitational/teleport.git && \
git clone git@github.com:gravitational/webapps.git && \
git clone git@github.com:gravitational/teleport.e.git && \
git clone git@github.com:gravitational/webapps.e.git
```

Ensure that you have set your `git config` user values for all repos.

```
cd webapps
git filter-repo --to-subdirectory-filter web # --force is required when doing branches

cd ../teleport
git checkout -b <dev>/teleport-merge
git pull ../webapps --no-rebase --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Create a Pull request into the appropriate Teleport branch and then merge.

```
cd ../webapps.e
git filter-repo --to-subdirectory-filter web # --force is required when doing branches

cd ../teleport.e
git checkout -b <dev>/teleport-merge
git pull ../webapps.e --no-rebase --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Create a Pull request into the appropriate Teleport enterprise branch and then merge.

At this point you'll need to make the necessary changes to the repositories
build systems to successfully build Teleport.

### Webapps repository

[repository](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps)

#### Actions

- [ ] Triage issues.
  - [ ] Close those that are no longer relevant.
  - [ ] [Transfer remaining issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository) to the [Teleport repo](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport)
  - [ ] Add the [ui label](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/labels/ui) to
        those transferred issues.
  - [ ] Prevent new issues from being created in this repo.
- [ ] Triage PRs.
  - [ ] Close those that are no longer relevant.
  - [ ] Merge remaining PRs.
  - [ ] Apply the necessary backports.
- [ ] Update [the default path to tsh in dev mode](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps/blob/27c615b3ff6f317a85fac4aa28b8e73fa4aa0d28/packages/teleterm/src/mainProcess/runtimeSettings.ts#L18-L23) for Connect.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` to indicate that this repository is no longer the
      source of truth and instead link to the `teleport` repo. Due to us needing
      to potentially update older releases we are not able to archive the
      repository at this time. We can revisit this in 6mo.

### Webapps.e repository

[repository](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps.e)

#### Actions

- [ ] Triage issues.
  - [ ] Close those that are no longer relevant.
  - [ ] [Transfer remaining issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/transferring-an-issue-to-another-repository) to the [Teleport.e repo](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.e)
  - [ ] Add the [ui label](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.e/labels/ui)
  - [ ] Prevent new issues from being created in this repo.
- [ ] Triage PRs.
  - [ ] Close those that are no longer relevant.
  - [ ] Merge remaining PR's.
  - [ ] Apply the necessary backports.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` to indicate that this repository is no longer the
      source of truth and instead link to the `teleport` repo. Due to us needing
      topotentially update older releases we are not able to archive the
      repository at this time. We can revisit this in 6mo.

### Teleport repository

[repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport)

#### Actions

- [ ] Remove `/webassets` submodule
  - This submodule is no longer required as the web UI will be built on-demand.
  - The folder will remain as the output location of the on-demand build but
    will not be comitted.
- [ ] Clone the [Webapps repository](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps) into
      the Teleport root. [Maintaining their respective git histories](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13040958/merge-two-git-repositories-without-breaking-file-history)
  - [ ] This will need to be done for every respective version branch (v9, v10, v11)
- [ ] Update targets that use the `packages/webapps.e` submodule to point points to
      the correct version in the `teleport.e/web` folder.
- [ ] Only require teleport build processes to run on teleport paths and the webapp
      ones to run on the webapp paths
- [ ] Update Connect's build pipelines as webapps will no longer need to be cloned.
