# RFD 0229b - Scopes: Machine & Workload Identity

## Required approvers

- Engineering: (@fspmarshall || @rosstimothy) && @timothyb89
- Product: ?

## What

Extend Machine & Workload Identity with support for the recently-introduced
Scopes feature. This will include adding scopes support to the configuration
mechanisms for MWI (e.g. the Bot) and support within `tbot` itself for correctly
issuing scoped certificates.

At this time, Scopes only has support for a subset of Teleport's features, and,
as such the design for MWI Scopes will be limited to those features.

## Why

There are largely two key motivations to implementing Scopes for MWI:

- To provide consistency of experience: Users of Teleport who are leveraging 
  scopes will want to be able to leverage them for machines as well as their
  humans.
- To resolve challenges with managing MWI in large organizations.

The first element is fairly self-explanatory, however, it is worth diving a 
little deeper into the problems we've seen with MWI in large organizations.

In a large organization, we usually see users of Teleport broken down into two 
categories: those who manage the Teleport infrastructure itself, and, those
who consume it for access to resources. This latter group often owns their
own infrastructure and these teams may wish to onboard MWI for Non-Human 
use-cases (e.g. CI/CD).

Unfortunately, granting these teams the ability to self-manage MWI configuration
resources isn't feasible due to the global, high-level of privilege this infers:

- Bot: A user who can create a Bot can assign it any role, including roles which
  may grant access to sensitive resources that are not owned by the user who is
  creating the bot. As the user can then join a Bot to receive credentials for
  these roles, they can effectively access any resources within their
  organization. This may be accidental or malicious.
- Join Token: To be able to join a Bot, a user must be able to create a join
  token. However, this privilege is not granular - the ability to create a join
  token permits a user to create a join token for any Bot (or indeed, other
  types of resource like a Proxy). This again provides a significant opportunity
  for privilege escalation.

Because of this, the configuration of MWI falls on the team that owns the
Teleport infrastructure itself. In smaller organizations this may be acceptable,
but in large organizations, this becomes a significant bottleneck for teams that
wish to onboard MWI and can even discourage its adoption.

To resolve this problem, we need to create a safe way for to delegate the
ability to onboard bots to teams that will leverage them.
