# RFD 182 - Multi-port TCP app access

## Required Approvers

* Engineering: @zmb3 && @nklaassen && (@espadolini || @smallinsky)

## What

Multi-port TCP app access enables cluster administrators to set up TCP apps that expose more than
just one port to the cluster.

## Why

In the past, many customers expressed interest in specifying a port range for an app
([#5669](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5669), [#10412](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/10412)).
Two customers asked about multi-port support immediately after seeing a demo of VNet. Some customers
have environments where a single logical app is spread across several ports.

Before VNet ([RFD 163](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0163-vnet.md)),
introducing multi-port support was limited by the fact that the end user would need to manually
start and manage a local proxy per each port. With VNet, this restriction is gone. We can extend
VNet and TCP app access in such a way that the end user can connect to
`tcp-app.teleport.example.com:1234` and the connection will be forwarded to the same port number on
the hostname specified in the app spec.

## Details

### UX

#### Setup

There's an app called waldo which accepts connections on multiple ports. Alice wants to make the app
available in the teleport.example.com cluster. She creates a new app and includes a new field called
`ports` in the app definition. She leaves the port number out of the `uri` field.

```yaml
apps:
- name: "waldo"
  uri: "tcp://localhost"
  ports:
  - port: 4080
    end_port: 4090
  - port: 5095
  labels:
    env: prod
```

#### Usage

##### Happy path

###### Regular usage

Bob wants to connect from his device to waldo using a CLI client called waldo-client. Bob sees in
Teleport Connect that the app waldo.teleport.example.com supports ports 4080 and 4081, which are the
default ports over which waldo-client connects. Bob starts VNet, opens his terminal of choice and
points waldo-client at the app in the cluster.

```
waldo-client waldo.teleport.example.com
```

###### Local proxy

Charlie needs to connect to waldo's debug service. Its API is typically available over the port
5095. Charlie uses Linux, where VNet is not yet available. Through `tsh apps ls` they see that the
waldo app supports the port 5095, so they start a local proxy that targets that port:

```
tsh proxy app waldo --port 5095:5095
waldo-debug localhost # In a separate shell session.
```

In this port mapping format, the first port is the local port used by the local proxy and the second
port is a target port that needs to match one of the ports from the app spec.

###### Per-session MFA

Bob wants to connect to waldo after Alice enabled per-session MFA on the cluster. Since waldo-client
connects to two different ports, Bob gets two separate MFA prompts in Teleport Connect. Once when
connecting over 4080 and once when connecting over 4081.

##### Error path

###### Incorrect port

Dave wants to connect to the debug port through VNet, but he makes a typo and provides a port
number that's not in the app spec.

```
waldo-debug waldo.teleport.example.com:5096
```

VNet notices that the port is not present in the cached app spec. It closes the connection and shows
an error in Connect.

###### Invalid app spec

Alice wants to extend the app spec with another port, 6060, but she makes a mistake and provides a
number bigger than 65535:

```yaml
apps:
- name: "waldo"
  uri: "tcp://localhost"
  ports:
  - port: 4080
    end_port: 4090
  - port: 5095
  - port: 66060
  labels:
    env: prod
```

The relevant UI (`teleport start`, `tctl edit`, etc.) returns an error about an incorrect port
in the app spec and prevents Alice from saving such app spec.

### Passing the port number from the client to the app agent

In order to pass the port number from the client to the app service, the port is going to be
included in `RouteToApp` portion of the app cert. `RouteToApp` is used today to route connections to
single-port TCP apps. With a few modifications, it can be used for multi-port access.

`RouteToApp` already has the `URI` field which includes the port number. However, the `URI` field is
a recent addition used solely for audit events, not as the source of truth in routing. Instead, the
app service reads [the current URI from the cache of the backend state](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/d6640d89d8a99908d7ac5385f2cfe0e08e230239/lib/srv/app/tcpserver.go#L45-L55).
A valid app cert grants access to a specific app as it's defined at any given moment on the backend,
not as it was defined at the time of generating a cert. We want to keep this behavior for
single-port apps after introducing multi-port apps.

As such, we cannot reuse the `URI` field by simply changing the port number in it. When looking at a
cert like this during routing, it'd be impossible to tell these two scenarios apart:

* The cert was issued for a multi-port app and allows access to a single port.
* The cert was issued for a single-port app and allows access to the port currently defined in the
  app spec.

The `URI` field should be left unchanged to merely mirror the same field from the app spec.

Instead, we add a `TargetPort` field to `RouteToApp`. The presence of this field signifies that the
cert grants access to the specific port of a specific app, as long as the port is currently defined
in the app spec. The `URI` field still won't be used as the source of truth for the hostname during
routing as we continue to use `URI` from the app spec.

When the port makes its way to the app service, the app service checks the port against ports
defined in the app spec before deciding whether to proxy the connection or not. The app service
[already has access to the app spec](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/5012036ad28a25d54858e454364828803f558e0b/lib/srv/app/connections_handler.go#L726).

At this point we don't plan to introduce RBAC for port numbers, but this is something we can
consider in the future. Port numbers on an individual app are akin to database names within a single
database server. Customers might want to treat them as such, by e.g. limiting access to different
ports.

#### Advantages

* It's the simplest way to add multi-port support to Teleport that doesn't set bad precedents.
* Old clients that don't send info about the target port can still be routed to the first port found
  in the `ports` field.
* Backward-compatible with existing UIs (tsh, tctl, Web UI, Connect). Requires minimal effort to add
  support for multi-port to those UIs.

#### Disadvantages

* Not so great performance in a situation where the end user wants to connect to many different ports
  at the same time. First connection over each port requires a new cert.
* Bad UX with per-session MFA enabled when connecting to many different ports at the same time. Each
  port requires a separate tap to create a cert.
  * However, for now the design partner wants to use multi-port for an app with two exposed ports
    that likely won't be used at the same time.
* While it doesn't introduce new bad precedents, it reinforces existing ones which prioritize
  reduced system complexity over user experience, namely the practice of embedding routing
  information within the cert.
  * The practice in itself is not bad, but we'll likely want to address it at some point to deal
    with performance (creating many certs) and UX issues (per-session MFA taps) it creates.
* It breaks compatibility – if an older app service gets a multi-port TCP app from the auth server
  through dynamic registration, it cannot proxy connections to that app because it doesn't know
  which port to proxy the connections to. See [Backward Compatibility](#backward-compatibility) for
  more details.

#### Alternative approaches

##### Embedding the port within SNI or an ALPN protocol

The port number could be included within TLS config on the client side, either as a special sudomain
in the SNI, e.g. `app-teleport-proxy-target-port-1337.teleport.cluster.local`, or a new ALPN
protocol, say `teleport-tcp@1337`.

We already have [`ProtocolAuth`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/8495398fa164aaa70236f6d7abd55238b2925cb2/lib/srv/alpnproxy/common/protocols.go#L99-L100)
in the form of `"teleport-auth@"` that's used to [pass the cluster name](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/8495398fa164aaa70236f6d7abd55238b2925cb2/lib/srv/alpnproxy/auth/auth_proxy.go#L96-L97)
when dialing the auth server.

Both solutions abuse ALPN to pass around extra info from the client. Both take care only of the part
between the client and the proxy service. The proxy service would still need to pass the port
somehow to the app service. At the moment, there doesn't seem to be a good way to do this, other
than adding new fields to `sshutils.DialReq` which would set a bad precedent.

##### Implementing a custom protocol

Instead of abusing ALPN, we could actually make use of it by implementing a custom protocol, say
`teleport-tcp-multi-port`. A client speaking this protocol would be expected to send
the port number in the first few bytes of the connection and then proxy the rest of the downstream
connection (of whatever client that wants to connect to a TCP app over a local proxy).

A server speaking the custom protocol on the other end of the connection, an app agent, would read
the port number and proxy the rest of the connection to the app itself on the given port.

This all seems fine until we consider how we could support both multi-port apps and regular
single-port apps. The ALPN proxy, after recognizing that the client wants to use
`teleport-tcp-multi-port`, would need to forward the connection to an app agent through the reverse
tunnel. For both types of TCP apps, the code that handles the connection would be pretty much the
same, with the exception of reading the port first. Unless we changed the setup so that two kinds of
app services register themselves in the reverse tunnel, the ALPN proxy would need to pass the
information about the multi-port protocol out of band to the app service. This seems to defeat the
purpose of using a custom protocol. The SNI and ALPN protocol solutions already pass the port number
out of band, without the overhead of a custom protocol.

##### Multiple apps with the same URI but different ports

Instead of including port numbers in the definition of a single app, the admin could add multiple
apps to the same app agent where the main difference between the apps would be a different port in
the URI. Then VNet could somehow wrap those apps so that from the perspective of the user, they
wouldn't need to connect to something like `app-1337.teleport.example.com` but rather just
`app.teleport.example.com:1337`.

While this could technically also work for web apps in the future, implementing this means adjusting
every single user-facing tool to support multi-port apps (the Web UI, Connect, tsh, tctl, …). Old
clients that do not support multi-port would see an almost identical app repeated once for every
port. Supporting wide port ranges would also be significantly harder, as each port would require its
own app resource. Per-session MFA would require creating a separate cert for each port.

### Passing the port number from VNet to the client

VNet [creates a proxy for an app](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/0b3163e7bd70afa5a2ddb5bd42f3efc034377d70/lib/vnet/app_resolver.go#L355)
at the point of [resolving an A query for the app](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/0b3163e7bd70afa5a2ddb5bd42f3efc034377d70/lib/vnet/vnet.go#L567).
With multi-port, VNet needs to create a local proxy at a later step, [in `vnet.NetworkStack.handleTCP`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/b5df678e22d26776aa87f9dd493b3c443e013fa4/lib/vnet/vnet.go#L377),
where it can read the port used by the connection (`req.ID().LocalPort`). It needs to maintain a map
of port numbers to local proxies to avoid creating a new proxy and a cert on each connection.

The final strategy to select an app and a port looks like this:

1. The client sends an A or AAAA query to VNet's DNS server.
1. VNet queries the cluster for an app spec where the hostname from the DNS query matches
   `public_addr`. It caches the app spec for later use. It responds to the DNS query with a
   virtual IP address.
1. The client creates a TCP connection to that address.
1. VNet receives the connection through the TUN device. At this point, VNet knows which port the
   client wants to use. VNet verifies if the port number is included in the port ranges in the
   cached app spec. If the port is not included, VNet closes the connection and shows an error in
   Connect.
1. If the port validation passes, VNet requests an app cert with said port in
   `RouteToApp.TargetPort` and starts a local proxy with this cert. VNet forwards the connection to
   the local proxy.

The next time a connection comes in on the same hostname and port, VNet reuses the cached app
spec and the local proxy to forward the connection to the proxy service, without having to perform
any extra queries to the cluster.

The initial implementation is not going to refresh the cached app spec, requiring the user to stop
and start VNet to refresh it. We assume that outside of the initial setup, app specs change rarely
enough where this behavior will be acceptable for early adopters. Later we might consider refreshing
the app spec whenever we get a connection on a port that's not in the spec or invalidating the cache
after refreshing an app cert in a local proxy.

### Configuration

```yaml
apps:
- name: "waldo"
  uri: "tcp://localhost"
  ports:
  - port: 4080
    end_port: 4090
  - port: 5095
  labels:
    env: prod
```

The ports are set through the `ports` field. The user is expected to not include the port number in
the `uri` field. `tctl edit`, `tctl create` and other means of adding apps should be updated to
prevent the user from including the port number in `uri` if the `ports` field is present.

Apps without the `ports` field and with no port number in the `uri` field should be allowed to exist
in order to avoid introducing a breaking change – those apps are technically allowed as of v16.2.
That is, Teleport v16.2 lets you define an app with the URI set to `"tcp://localhost"` and it will
only return an error during an actual connection attempt.

Each port range is represented as a dictionary with `port` and `end_port` fields. `end_port` is
optional if the user wants to specify just a single port. This was chosen over the initial idea of
using something like `ports: [4080-4090, 5095]`. This is because we don't want to store short
notation like this on the backend which would then require parsing it into proper structures. At the
moment, we also don't have an established pattern for providing different marshalling for the
backend vs clients like tctl. See [the Slack discussion](https://gravitational.slack.com/archives/C0DF0TPMY/p1726744724519649)
about this.

In order to keep the implementation simple, the user is allowed to duplicate port numbers and
ranges. The only validation in place is going to be that any given port number and port
range start and end must be within 1–65535 and that the start of a port range must be less than the
end, rendering the following not valid:

```yaml
apps:
- name: "foo"
  uri: "tcp://localhost"
  ports:
  - port: 1234
    end_port: 1234
  - port: 4090
    end_port: 4080
```

#### Limitations

Since a single app spec is supposed to specify available ports, it will not be possible to
distribute different ports of the same logical Teleport TCP app across different app services. For
example, had we chosen to go with [collapsing multiple app specs](#multiple-apps-with-the-same-uri-but-different-ports)
with the same URI but a different port into a single app, it'd have been possible to put each of
those app specs on a separate app service. This is something customers with an extensive HA setup
could want Teleport to support.

```
- name: "foo"
  uri: "tcp://localhost:3000"
  labels:
    env: prod
```

```
- name: "foo"
  uri: "tcp://localhost:3001"
  labels:
    env: prod
```

### Security

By using wide ranges of allowed ports, cluster admins can mistakenly grant access to ports that
shouldn't be accessible within Teleport. As there's no RBAC for ports, a user with access to an app
can access any of the ports specified in the app spec.

### Privacy

Multi-port TCP access does not warrant extra privacy considerations as no sensitive data is
exchanged between the client and the server.

### UI

`tsh apps ls` and `tsh apps ls -R` include a column called Target Ports if any of the returned apps
supports multiple target ports. If a TCP app has only a single port, its port is not shown in Target
Ports – VNet always routes connections from any port to the same single target port.

```
$ tsh apps ls
Application      Description Type Public Address                      Target Ports    Labels
---------------- ----------- ---- ----------------------------------- --------------- --------
dumper                       HTTP dumper.teleport-local.dev
example1         Example app HTTP example1.teleport-local.dev                         env=test
simplehttpserver             HTTP simplehttpserver.teleport-local.dev
tcp-postgres                 TCP  tcp-postgres.teleport-local.dev
waldo                        TCP  waldo.teleport-local.dev            4080-4090, 5095 env=prod
```

The Web UI and Connect show a list of available target ports through a three dots button next to the
main button in the resource card. Ports are clickable and result in the hostname + port being copied
to the clipboard. Port ranges are clickable too and result in the hostname + port range being
copied.

In Connect, clicking on a port starts VNet if it's not already running and shows a notification
about the text being copied to the clipboard, similar to how clicking "Connect" next to a TCP app
works today.

<img width="518" alt="Available ports after clicking Connect in Teleport Connect" src="assets/0182-connect-available-ports.png">

The user can also select "Connect without VNet" which starts a regular local proxy. From there, the
user is still able to select the target port. This field is not shown if the app doesn't support
multiple ports. The default port is the first port found in the `ports` field. There will be a basic
validation to make sure that the user does not set the target port to one that the app doesn't
support.

### Backward Compatibility

#### Server-client compatibility

Old clients that do not support multi-port apps don't show the URI anywhere, with the exception of
`tsh apps ls -v` and `tctl get`. A client connecting to a TCP app is not expected to even know about
the URI. This means we are able to provide partial backward compatibility for older clients in the
form of connecting them to the first port found in the app spec. This is true for all cases except a
specific scenario with dynamic app registration described below.

In Teleport v16.2 and before, it's completely valid to define an app with no port number in the URI.
In that case, the app service returns an error when attempting to connect to such an app because
[`dialer.DialContext` fails](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/02237c56cde38bb4d6caca4b566f6e6e0192fc3e/lib/srv/app/tcpserver.go#L55-L58)
with an error about a missing port number.

In the examples below, version N is the first version of Teleport that supports multi-port TCP
access, N - 1 is a version before that.

##### Services on version N, a client on version N - 1

Since the client doesn't know about available ports, it's not going to include a port number when
asking for an app cert.

In this case, we can support old clients by the app service defaulting to the first port from the
`ports` field if no port was included in the cert.

##### Auth and proxy services on version N, app service on version N - 1

An app service on version N - 1 cannot statically define a multi-port TCP app.

However, it's possible that the app service is fed a multi-port app from the auth service through
dynamic registration. There's no way for the app service to continue, so it returns an error, just
like a v16.2 app service when a TCP app doesn't specify the port in the URI. This is a price we are
willing to pay for reduced implementation and UX complexity compared to the solutions described
below. Single-port apps would still be served just fine by an app service on version N - 1.

##### Alternative approaches

###### Port in `uri` and `extra_ports` field

Instead of having a `ports` field, we could support an app spec which uses both `uri` and a new
field to determine available ports:

```yaml
apps:
- name: "waldo"
  uri: "tcp://localhost:4080"
  extra_ports:
  - port: 4081
    end_port: 4090
  - port: 5095
  labels:
    env: prod
```

This way even an app service that doesn't support multi-port could provide partial access to a
multi-port app by reading the port from the `uri` field. But does it count as backward
compatibility? Imagine an N client connecting to an N proxy service wanting to be forwarded to port
number 4085, only for an N - 1 app agent to disregard the port number and forward the connection to
4080.

Both options have their pros and cons, but we decided to pick `ports` because it has a slightly
better long-term UX. It lets us drop the "extra" suffix from the field name. If the user wants to
set a single range _a-b_, it avoids forcing them to split the range into _a, (a+1)-b_ like in the
example above.

###### New app resource version

If the only scenario where the `ports` field breaks backward compatibility is dynamic app
registration, we could introduce a new version of the app resource. The intent would be to let the
old app service drop the unrecognized version of an app resource when receiving it from the auth
service.

However, this is not how the app service operates today. When an app service populates its cache
with dynamically registered apps, it interprets all apps as V3 apps, meaning we can't add a V4 app
and have it ignored by an app service that doesn't support V4 apps.

Even if this was possible, it would still not solve a situation where a version N client connects to
a version N proxy and wants to connect to a multi-port app through a version N - 1 app agent.
Presumably, the client would see that a multi-port app is available, but if the app service that's
supposed to handle this app doesn't handle V4 apps, then the app service would not be able to
forward the connection.

#### VNet with single-port apps

Before multi-port was available, VNet would let you connect to an arbitrary port on the public
address of an app. The connection would ultimately be forwarded to the port number from the `uri`
field of the app spec. This behavior is kept for single-port apps for backward compatibility. The
port number is not included in the cert in this case.

### Audit Events

The way audit events work for local proxies with single-port TCP apps is as follows. When the app
service agent proxies a connection to the actual URI of an app, the agent creates an
`app.session.start` event. Each new connection made through the proxy creates another
`app.session.start` event. Each of those events shares the same session ID (`sid`), because [session
ID comes from the cert](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/d1c7f26e70544879c04f184d88b9fbc07626be6b/lib/srv/app/common/audit.go#L94)
and the cert is the same for all connections coming from a single local proxy.

The only thing that changes for multi-port apps is that we add `app_target_port` field which
includes the port to which the connection was forwarded to. The session ID is the same for
connections forwarded to the same port using the same cert and different for connections on
different ports. This means that two connections on two different ports for the same app are going
to generate two `app.session.start` events which are identical, with the exception of
`app_target_port`, `time`, `sid`, and `uid` fields.

### Observability

Whether the target port makes it all the way from the client to the app service can be observed by
the `app.session.start` audit event. It should include the correct port in the `app_target_port`
field.

We don't expect the implementation to impact performance. The cert used to transport the port number
already includes routing details for apps. The app service already has access to the app spec to
verify whether the target port is valid, so it doesn't need to perform any additional network calls.

### Product Usage

The telemetry already tracks TCP app sessions through the `tp.session.start.v2` event where
`tp.session_type` is set to `app_tcp`. We're going to extend this event with a new boolean property
called `tp.app.is_multi_port`, which value is going to depend on the presence of `AppTargetPort` in
`AppMetadata` of `apievents.AppSessionStart`.

### Test Plan

The Application Access section of the test plan needs to be extended with these items:

- [ ] Verify Audit Records
  - [ ] For multi-port TCP apps, `app.session.start` includes the chosen target port in the
    `app_target_port` field.
- [ ] Verify multi-port TCP access with `tsh proxy app` (link to docs).
  - [ ] Can create a TCP app with multiple ports and port ranges.
  - [ ] Cannot access ports not listed in the app spec.
  - [ ] `tctl edit`, `tctl create` and `teleport start` return an error if the app spec includes a
    port number outside of the 1-65535 range.

The VNet section of Teleport Connect test plan needs to be extended with these items:

- [ ] Verify that VNet works with multi-port TCP apps. Connecting to an app from a VNet-enabled
  device over a certain port should forward the connection to the same port on the hostname
  specified by the URI field in the app spec.
