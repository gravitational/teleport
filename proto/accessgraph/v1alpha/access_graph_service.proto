//    Irreconcilable conflicts (ex.: invalid start date) typically result in the
//    server logging an error, using the persisted config, and signaling this outcome.
//
// 2. Event Batch (`events`): Sends a batch of audit logs (`AuditLogEvents`) in an
//    unstructured format. Each batch must also include the corresponding
//    `resume_state` information ('search' or 'bulk' type) reflecting the client's
//    processing progress for that specific event source type up to the included events.

//    dates that are fully completed.

// Behavior and Constraints:
// - Direction: Client -> Server only.
