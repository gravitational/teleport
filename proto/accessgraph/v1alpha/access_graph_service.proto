//    be the proposed, an inferred default, or the existing persisted one).
//    Irreconcilable conflicts (ex.: invalid start date) typically result in the
//    server logging an error, using the persisted config, and signaling this outcome.
//
// 2. Event Batch (`events`): Sends a batch of audit logs (`AuditLogEvents`) in an
//    unstructured format. Each batch must also include the corresponding
//    `resume_state` information ('search' or 'bulk' type) reflecting the client's
//    processing progress for that specific event source type up to the included events.

//    separate from event batches, to request that the server prune state for past
//    dates that are fully completed.
//
// Behavior and Constraints:
// - Direction: Client -> Server only.
// - Initial Message: First message on stream MUST be `config`.
// - Stream State Consistency: `resume_state` with `events` corresponds to
//   'search' or 'bulk' tracking mode. While primarily one mode operates,
//   upgrades 'search' -> 'bulk' may be possible; downgrading 'bulk' -> 'search'
