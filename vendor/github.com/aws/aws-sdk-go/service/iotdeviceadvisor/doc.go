// Package iotdeviceadvisor provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS IoT Core Device Advisor.
//
// Amazon Web Services IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed
// test capability for validating IoT devices during device software development.
// Device Advisor provides pre-built tests that you can use to validate IoT
// devices for reliable and secure connectivity with Amazon Web Services IoT
// Core before deploying devices to production. By using Device Advisor, you
// can confirm that your devices can connect to Amazon Web Services IoT Core,
// follow security best practices and, if applicable, receive software updates
// from IoT Device Management. You can also download signed qualification reports
// to submit to the Amazon Web Services Partner Network to get your device qualified
// for the Amazon Web Services Partner Device Catalog without the need to send
// your device in and wait for it to be tested.
