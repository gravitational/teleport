// Package iotwireless provides the client and types for making API
// requests to AWS IoT Wireless.
//
// AWS IoT Wireless provides bi-directional communication between internet-connected
// wireless devices and the AWS Cloud. To onboard both LoRaWAN and Sidewalk
// devices to AWS IoT, use the IoT Wireless API. These wireless devices use
// the Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) communication protocol to communicate
// with AWS IoT.
//
// Using the API, you can perform create, read, update, and delete operations
// for your wireless devices, gateways, destinations, and profiles. After onboarding
// your devices, you can use the API operations to set log levels and monitor
// your devices with CloudWatch.
//
// You can also use the API operations to create multicast groups and schedule
// a multicast session for sending a downlink message to devices in the group.
// By using Firmware Updates Over-The-Air (FUOTA) API operations, you can create
// a FUOTA task and schedule a session to update the firmware of individual
// devices or an entire group of devices in a multicast group.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS IoT Wireless with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.
