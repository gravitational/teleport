// Package detective provides the client and types for making API
// requests to Amazon Detective.
//
// Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help
// you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services
// (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based
// events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail
// and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts
// findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.
//
// The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior
// graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member
// accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.
//
// To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account
// sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation,
// it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.
//
// Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization management
// account designates the Detective administrator account for the organization.
// That account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior
// graph. The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account
// as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization
// accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account
// can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.
//
// Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to
// manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with
// the currently selected endpoint.
//
// The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API
// to do the following:
//
//    * Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior
//    graph.
//
//    * View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
//
//    * Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
//
//    * Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
//
//    * Apply tags to a behavior graph.
//
// The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the
// delegated administrator for Detective.
//
// The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the Detective
// API to do the following:
//
//    * Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.
//
//    * Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts
//    as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.
//
// An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:
//
//    * View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
//
//    * Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
//
//    * Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
//
//    * Remove their account from a behavior graph.
//
// All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See Logging Detective API
// Calls with CloudTrail (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).
//
// We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account."
// An administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In
// the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in
// their behavior graph.

// Using the Client
//
// To contact Amazon Detective with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
