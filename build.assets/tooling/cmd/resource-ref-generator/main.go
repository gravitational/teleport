const configHelp string = `The path to a YAML configuration file with the following fields:

## Main config

required_field_types: a list of type info mappings (see "Type info") indicating
type names of fields that must be present in a dynamic resource before we
include it in the reference. For example, if this is "Metadata" from package
"types", a struct type must include a field with the a field of "types.Metadata"
before we add it to the reference.

source (string): the path to the root of a Go project directory.

destination (string): the path to a directory where the generator writes
reference pages.

excluded_resource_types: a list of type info mappings (see "Type info")
indicating names of resources to exclude from the reference. 

field_assignment_method: the name of a method of a resource type that assigns
fields to the resource. Used to identify the kind and version of a resource.

## Type info

package: The path of a Go package
name: The name of a type within the package

## Example

required_types:
  - name: Metadata
    package: api/types
  - name: ResourceHeader
    package: api/types
source: "api"
destination: "docs/pages/includes/resource-reference.mdx"
excluded_resource_types:
  - package: "types"
    name: "ResourceHeader"
field_assignment_method: "setStaticFields"
