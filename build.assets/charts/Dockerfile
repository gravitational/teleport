# Install dumb-init and ca-certificates. The dumb-init package is to ensure
# signals and orphaned processes are handled correctly. The ca-certificates
# package is installed because the base Ubuntu image does not come with any
# certificate authorities. libelf1 is a dependency introduced by Teleport 7.0.
#
# The below packages are provided for debug purposes. Installing them adds around
#  six megabytes to the image size. The packages include the following commands:
# * net-tools

#   * ifconfig

#   * mii-tool
#   * nameif

# * busybox (see "busybox --list" for all provided utils)
#   * less
#   * nslookup
