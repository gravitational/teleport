# Install the teleport binary from an architecture-specific debian package. Note
# that we cannot simply pass a ready-made package filename in as a build-arg, as
# this dockerfile is used for a multiarch build and any build-args will be
# re-used for multiple ${TARGETARCH}es. In order to get around this we pass
# various components of the architecture-specific debian package filename in as
# individual build args and re-assemble it *inside* the build.

# NOTE that TELEPORT_RELEASE_INFIX *must* include the leading dash if set.
