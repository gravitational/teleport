# This Dockerfile makes the "build box connect" the container used
# to build the Teleport Connect.
#
# This image is base on the node image, which is based on Debian Buster.
# Using it as a image allows us to link agains the same version of
# glibc as Node.js.
#
# Check the README to learn how to safely introduce changes to Dockerfiles.
