/**
 * DeviceTrustService provides methods to manage, enroll and authenticate

 * A trusted device is a device that is registered and enrolled with Teleport,
 * thus allowing the system to provide some guarantees about its provenance and
 * state.
 *
 * Managing devices requires the corresponding CRUD "device" permission.
 * Additionally, creating enrollment tokens requires the "create_enroll_token"
 * permission and enrolling devices requires the "enroll" permission. See
 * CreateDevice, CreateDeviceEnrollToken and EnrollDevice for reference.
 *
 * An authenticated, trusted device allows its user to perform device-aware
 * actions. Such actions include accessing an SSH node, managing sensitive
 * resources via `tctl`, etc. The enforcement mode is defined via cluster-wide
 * and/or per-role toggles. Device authentication is automatic for enrolled
 * devices communicating with Enterprise clusters. See AuthenticateDevice for
 * reference.
 *
 * Device Trust is a Teleport Enterprise feature. Open Source Teleport clusters
 * treat all Device RPCs as unimplemented (which, in fact, they are for OSS.)
