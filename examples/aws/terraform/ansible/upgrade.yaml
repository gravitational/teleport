# This is a naive deployment example
# to highlight the most important upgrade points:
#
# * Ordering of the upgrades
# * Scale down/ups of auth servers during upgrades
#
# Things to be done before this is production ready
#
# * Backup/restore of database before auth server upgrades
# * Collaboration with load balancers to drain connections
# * Health checks post auth server upgrade
# * Rollbacks and restores from backups
