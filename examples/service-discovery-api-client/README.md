# Minimal Teleport API client: service discovery

This is a minimal working example of a Teleport API client that registers agents
in sync with a service discovery example. To use it, follow the setup steps we
describe in the [Teleport
documentation](https://goteleport.com/docs/api/automatically-register-agents/).
