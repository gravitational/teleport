    # Enabled specifies whether this SAML connector supports MFA checks.
    enabled: true
    # entity_descriptor_url should point to an IdP configured app that handles MFA checks.
    # In most cases, this value should be different from the entity_descriptor_url above.

    # force_reauth determines whether existing login sessions are accepted or if
    # re-authentication is always required. Defaults to "yes". This should only be
    # set to false if the app described above is setup to perform MFA checks on top
    # of active user sessions.
