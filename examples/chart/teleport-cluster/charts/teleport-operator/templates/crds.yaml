{{- /* This template iterates over every CRD in the `operator-crds/` directory
and creates them if needed. It also adds common labels, like any other
Helm-deployed resource.

We cannot rely on the "crds/" Helm directory as Helm's strategy is "fire and forget".
We have no way to update the CRDs after the initial deployment. As Teleport keeps
adding new field to existing CRs, we need a deployment strategy that supports
updating CRDs.

The obvious solution would be to have a separate chart for CRs but we wanted to
have everything functional in a single "helm install", hence the rube goldberg
mechanism to try to guess what to do with the CRDs (see the implementation of
shouldInstallCRDs in _helpers.yaml for more details). */ -}}
