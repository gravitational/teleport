                  launch url can be configured to launch users directly into the service

                  support IdP initiated authentication, it can be useful if that service
                  provider acts as a master authentication service provider for internal
                  services. In such case, Teleport administrator can configure launch
                  URL, that lets user pick a specific internal service URL from the
                  Log In tile in the UI, which would take them to that particular
                  service for authentication instead of directly launching to the
