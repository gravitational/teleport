#

# teleport -- contains the configuration describing how the plugin connects to
# your Teleport cluster.
teleport:
  # teleport.address(string) -- is the address of the Teleport cluster the plugin
  # connects to. The address must contain both the domain name and the port of
  # the Teleport cluster. It can be either the address of the auth servers or the
  # proxy servers.
  #
  # For example:
  #   - joining a Proxy: `teleport.example.com:443` or `teleport.example.com:3080`
  #   - joining an Auth: `teleport-auth.example.com:3025`
  address: ""
  # teleport.identitySecretName(string) -- is the name of the Kubernetes secret
  # that contains the credentials for the connection to your Teleport cluster.
  #
  # The secret should be in the following format:
  #
  # ```yaml
  # apiVersion: v1
  # kind: Secret
  # type: Opaque
  # metadata:
  #   name: teleport-plugin-slack-identity
  # data:
  #   auth_id: #...
  # ```

  # teleport.identitySecretPath(string) -- is the key in the Kubernetes secret

  # the connection to your Teleport cluster. If the secret has the path,
  # `"auth_id"`, you can omit this field.
  identitySecretPath: "auth_id"

# slack -- contains the configuration used by the plugin to authenticate to Slack.
#
# You can pass the Slack token:
# - via the chart Values by setting `slack.token`
# - via an existing Kubernetes Secret by setting `slack.tokenFromSecret`
slack:
  # slack.token(string) -- is the Slack token used by the plugin to interact
  # with Slack. When set, the Chart creates a Kubernetes Secret for you.
  #
  # This value has no effect if `slack.tokenFromSecret` is set.
  token: ""
  # slack.tokenFromSecret(string) -- is the name of the Kubernetes Secret
  # containing the Slack token. When this value is set, you must create the\
  # Secret before creating the chart release.
  tokenFromSecret: ""
  # slack.tokenSecretPath(string) -- is the Kubernetes Secret key
  # containing the Slack token. The secret name is set via `slack.tokenFromSecret`.
  tokenSecretPath: "slackToken"

# roleToRecipients(object) -- is mapping the requested role name to a list of
# recipients the plugin will notify.
# It must contain a mapping for `*` in case no matching roles are found.
#
# Example value:
# ```yaml
# roleToRecipients:
#  "*": "admin-slack-channel"
#  dev:
#    - "dev-slack-channel"
#    - "admin-slack-channel"
#  dba: "alex@example.com"
# ```
roleToRecipients: {}

# log -- controls the plugin logging.
log:
  # log.severity(string) -- is the log level for the Teleport process.
  # Available log levels are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`.
  #
  # The default is `INFO`, which is recommended in production.
  # `DEBUG` is useful during first-time setup or to see more detailed logs for debugging.
  severity: INFO
  # log.output(string) -- sets the output destination for the Teleport process.
  # This can be set to any of the built-in values: `stdout`, `stderr`.
  #
  # The value can also be set to a file path (such as `/var/log/teleport.log`)
  # to write logs to a file. Bear in mind that a few service startup messages
  # will still go to `stderr` for resilience.
  output: stdout

# objects created by the chart. See [the Kubernetes annotation
# documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/)

#
# image -- sets the container image used for plugin pods created by the chart.

# You can override this to use your own plugin image rather than a Teleport-published image.
image:

  # image.tag(string) -- Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  #
  # Normally, the version of the Teleport plugin matches the
  # version of the chart. If you install chart version 15.0.0, you'll use
  # the plugin version 15.0.0. Upgrading the plugin is done by upgrading the chart.
  #

  #
  # If you want to run the Teleport plugin version `X.Y.Z`, you should use
