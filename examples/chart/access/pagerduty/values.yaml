# You can pass the PagerDuty API key:
# - via the chart Values by setting `pagerduty.apiKey`
# - via an existing Kubernetes Secret by setting `pagerduty.apiKeyFromSecret`
pagerduty:

# log -- controls the plugin logging.
log:
  # log.severity(string) -- is the log level for the Teleport process.
  # Available log levels are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`.
  #
  # The default is `INFO`, which is recommended in production.
  # `DEBUG` is useful during first-time setup or to see more detailed logs for debugging.
  severity: INFO
  # log.output(string) -- sets the output destination for the Teleport process.
  # This can be set to any of the built-in values: `stdout`, `stderr`.
  #
  # The value can also be set to a file path (such as `/var/log/teleport.log`)
  # to write logs to a file. Bear in mind that a few service startup messages
  # will still go to `stderr` for resilience.
  output: stdout

  #
  # Normally, the version of the Teleport plugin matches the
  # version of the chart. If you install chart version 15.0.0, you'll use
  # the plugin version 15.0.0. Upgrading the plugin is done by upgrading the chart.
