# Teleport Microsoft Teams access request plugin

The Teleport Access API provides a Microsoft Teams access request plugin that
sends a message to users on Microsoft Teams when an access request is created.

You can find the Teleport Access API in the main Teleport repository and
code of the MSTeams access request plugin
in `github.com/gravitational/teleport/integrations/access/msteams`.

If you have a self-hosted Teleport deployment, you can find information for
configuring this access request plugin
in [Access Requests with Microsoft Teams](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-msteams/).
