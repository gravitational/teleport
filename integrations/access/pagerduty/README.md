# Teleport PagerDuty access request plugin

The Teleport Access API provides a PagerDuty access request plugin that allows
you to treat Teleport resource and role access requests as PagerDuty incidents,
send incident notifications to the appropriate teams, and approve or deny
requests using a PagerDuty special action.

You can find the Teleport Access API in the main Teleport repository and the
PagerDuty access request plugin
in `github.com/gravitational/teleport/integrations/access/pagerduty`.

If you have a self-hosted Teleport deployment, you can find information for
configuring this access request
plugin [Access Requests with PagerDuty](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-pagerduty/).
