# Teleport Discord access request plugin

The Teleport Access API provides a simple Discord access request plugin that
sends an alert to a Discord channel when an access request is created. You can
find the Teleport Access API in the main Teleport repository and the Discord
access request plugin
in `github.com/gravitational/teleport/integrations/access/discord`.

If you have a self-hosted Teleport deployment, you can find information for
configuring this access request plugin
in [Access Requests with Discord](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-discord/).
