# Teleport email access request plugin

The Teleport Access API provides a simple email access request plugin that sends
email notifications to specified email addresses or distribution lists when an
access request is created. You can find the Teleport Access API in the main
Teleport repository and the code of the email access request plugin
in `github.com/gravitational/teleport/integrations/access/email`.

If you have a self-hosted Teleport deployment, you can find information for
configuring this access request plugin in [Teleport Access Requests with Email](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-email/).
