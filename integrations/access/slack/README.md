# Teleport Slack access request plugin

The Teleport Access API provides a simple Slack access request plugin that sends
an alert to a Slack channel when an access request is created. You can find the
Teleport Access API in the main Teleport repository and the Slack access request
plugin in `github.com/gravitational/teleport/integrations/access/slack`.

If you have a self-hosted Teleport deployment, you can find information for
configuring this access request plugin in [Access Requests with Slack](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-slack/).
