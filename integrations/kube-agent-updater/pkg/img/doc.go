// Package img contains the required interfaces and logic to validate that an
// image has been issued by Teleport and can be trusted.
//
// There are multiple image signature mechanisms competing, the Docker Content
// Trust (DCT) stores signatures in the manifest index itself. This approach is
// more  constraining because the signed object and the original object end up
// having different Digests. Signatures cannot be added or modified a
// posteriori.
//
// Cosign is another emerging signature standard, its signature specification is
// described here: https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/SIGNATURE_SPEC.md
// Cosign signatures are stored as images in the artifact registry, alongside
// the signed image. As signatures are stored separately, an object can be
// signed multiple times and this does not affect its digest.
// At the time of writing, cosign supports both static key signing and
// "keyless" (short-lived certificates) signing through the Fulcio CA.
// Keyless singing is still experimental and we don't use it yet, support might
// be added in the future.
//
// The Cosign validator delegates all validation logic to the upstream cosign
// implementation. This is a good thing as we benefit from all the bug fixes
// and security audits they make. However, we still to test against a
// wide range of valid and invalid signatures to make sure we invoke cosign
// properly and validate all fields and claims. As there are no tools to craft
// broken and invalid signatures, we needed to write out own fixture generator.
// Fixture generation is done by
// `teleport/integrations/kube-agent-updater/hack/cosign-fixtures.go`. The
// executable generates a go file declaring all blobs and manifests to be
// loaded in the test registry.
