                description: MaxSessionLengthBytes is the maximum session length that
                  can be sent to inference provider. Currently, it's determined by
                  the size of model's context window; future versions of Teleport
                  will allow summarizing larger sessions by splitting them.  Inference
                  providers will reject requests that are larger than given model's
                  context window. Since context windows are usually sized in tokens,
                  this value is an approximation. Assuming 2 bytes per input token
                  should be safe.  Currently, Teleport will outright reject sessions
                  larger than this limit; future versions will split sessions in chunks,
                  treating this size as a maximum.  If unset or set to 0, defaults
                  to 1MB.
