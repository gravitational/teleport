			What does runtime.Gosched() do?
			> Gosched yields the processor, allowing other goroutines to run. It does not
			> suspend the current goroutine, so execution resumes automatically.

			Why do we need it?
			There are two concurrent goroutines at this point:
			- this one
			- the one that executes `fn()`
			When this one is scheduled to run it advances the clock a bit more.
			It might happen that this one keeps running over and over, while the other one is not scheduled.
			When that happens, the other 'select' (the one in decorr.Do) gets called and returns nil,
			the goroutine sets the `dur` value.
			However, it's too late because the observed time (`dur`) is already larger than expected.

			If both goroutines ran sequentially, this would work.
			Calling runtime.Gosched here, tries to give priority to the other goroutine.
			So, when the other goroutine's select is ready (the clock.After returns), it immediately returns and
			`dur` has the expected value.
