<Admonition type="info">
This is reference page is for the Teleport MWI Terraform provider, which
generates short-lived credentials using Teleport Machine & Workload Identity.
These short-lived credentials can be used to grant other Terraform providers
access to resources through Teleport.

If you are looking to manage the configuration of Teleport itself, use the
[Teleport Terraform Provider](../../terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx)
instead.
</Admonition>

The Teleport MWI Terraform provider supports the following ephemeral resources:
{{ range $key, $value := .EphemeralResourceFiles }}
  - [`{{$key}}`](./{{$value}}.mdx)
{{- end }}
