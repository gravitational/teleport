## 11.3.10 (03/30/23)

This release of Teleport contains 2 security fixes as well as multiple improvements and bug fixes.

### [High] OS authorization bypass in SSH tunneling

When establishing an SSH port forwarding connection, Teleport did not
sufficiently validate the specified OS principal.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid cluster credentials to
establish a TCP tunnel to a node using a non-existent Linux user.

The connection attempt would show up in the audit log as a "port" audit event
(code T3003I) and include a Teleport username in the "user" field.

### [High] Teleport authorization bypass in Kubernetes Access

When authorizing a Kubernetes access request, Teleport did not adequately
validate the target Kubernetes cluster.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid Kubernetes agent credentials
or a join token to trick Teleport into forwarding requests to a different
Kubernetes cluster.

Every Kubernetes request would show up in the audit log as a "kube.request"
audit event (code T3009I) and include the Kubernetes cluster metadata.

### Secure certificate mapping for Desktop Access

Later this year, Windows will begin requiring a stronger mapping from a certificate
to an Active Directory user. In anticipation of this change, Teleport 11.2.0 is compliant
with the new requirements.

*Warning:* This feature requires that Teleport's own service account also uses a strong
mapping. In order to support this requirement, you must now set a new Security Identifier
(`sid`) field in the LDAP configuration for your Windows Desktop Services. You can find
the SID for your service account by running the following PowerShell snippet
(replace `svc-teleport` with the name of the service account you are using):

```
Get-AdUser -Identity svc-teleport | Select SID
```

## 11.1.4

This release of Teleport contains multiple security fixes, improvements and bug fixes.

*Note:* This release of Teleport contains an issue that affects backwards compatibility
with database access agents. If you are a database access user we recommend skipping
straight to version 11.2.0.

### [Critical] RBAC bypass in SSH TCP tunneling

When establishing a direct-tcpip channel, Teleport did not sufficiently validate
RBAC.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid cluster credentials to
establish a TCP tunnel to a node they didn’t have access to.

The connection attempt would show up in the audit log as a “port” audit event
(code T3003I) and include Teleport username in the “user” field.

### [High] Application access session hijack

When accepting application access requests, Teleport did not sufficiently
validate client credentials.

This could allow an attacker in possession of a valid active application session
ID to issue requests to this application impersonating the session owner for a
limited time window.

Presence of multiple “cert.create” audit events (code TC000I) with the same app
session ID in the “route_to_app.session_id” field may indicate the attempt to
impersonate an existing user’s application session.

### [Medium] SSH IP pinning bypass

When issuing a user certificate, Teleport did not check for the presence of IP
restrictions in the client’s credentials.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid client credentials with IP
restrictions to reissue credentials without IP restrictions.

Presence of a “cert.create” audit event (code TC000I) without corresponding
“user.login” audit event (codes T1000I or T1101I) for users with IP restricted
roles may indicate an issuance of a certificate without IP restrictions.

### [Low] Web API session caching

After logging out via the web UI, a user’s session could remain cached in
Teleport’s proxy, allowing continued access to resources for a limited time
window.

## 11.0.0

Teleport 11 brings the following new major features and improvements:

- Hardware-backed private keys support for server access (Enterprise only).
- Replacement of obsolete SCP protocol with SFTP for server access.
- Removal of persistent storage requirement for Helm charts.
- Automatic discovery and enrollment of EKS/AKS clusters for Kubernetes access.
- Richer Azure integrations for server and database access.
- Cassandra and Scylla support for database access, including AWS Keyspaces.
- GitHub Actions and Terraform support for Machine ID.
- Access Requests and file upload/download support for Teleport Connect.

### Hardware-backed private keys (Enterprise Only)

Teleport 11 clients (such as tsh or Connect) support storing their private key
material on Yubikey devices instead of filesystem which helps prevent
credentials exfiltration attacks.

See how to enable it in the
[documentation](./docs/pages/access-controls/guides/hardware-key-support.mdx):

Hardware-backed private keys is an enterprise only feature, and is currently
supported for server access only.

### SFTP protocol

Teleport 11 adds server-side support for SFTP protocol which many IDEs such as
VSCode or JetBrains PyCharm, GoLand and others use for browsing, copying, and
editing files on remote systems.

The following guides explain how to use IDEs to connect to a remote machine via
Teleport:

- [VS Code](./docs/pages/server-access/guides/vscode.mdx)
- [JetBrains](./docs/pages/server-access/guides/jetbrains-sftp.mdx)

In addition, Teleport 11 clients will use SFTP protocol for file transfer under
the hood instead of the obsolete scp protocol. Server-side scp is still
supported so existing clients aren’t affected.

### Helm charts persistent storage

In Teleport 11 users no longer need to use persistent storage when deploying
Helm charts. When running on Kubernetes, Teleport services will now store their
identities in Kubernetes Secrets which removes the need for using persistent
storage or static join tokens.

For existing deployments, this change involves migration from Deployment to
StatefulSet which is performed automatically during Helm upgrade to Teleport 11.

### EKS/AKS discovery

Teleport 11 adds support for automatic discovery and enrollment of AWS Elastic
Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

### Azure integrations

Teleport 11 improves Azure support in multiple areas.

Teleport agents running on Azure VMs will now automatically import Azure tags to
label resources.

Teleport database access now supports auto-discovery for Azure-hosted PostgreSQL
and MySQL databases. See the [Azure
guide](docs/pages/database-access/guides/azure-postgres-mysql.mdx) for more
details.

In addition, Teleport database access will now use Azure AD managed identity
authentication for Azure-hosted SQL Server databases.

### Cassandra/ScyllaDB

Teleport 11 adds support for Cassandra and ScyllaDB databases in Database
Access. This includes support for AWS Keyspaces.

### Machine ID

Teleport 11 adds support for secret-less joining of Machine ID agents in GitHub
Actions workflows. See the guide for more details: TODO

We have also released a GitHub Action for setting up the Teleport binaries
within a GitHub workflow environment. More details regarding this can be found
at the Teleport GitHub Actions repository:

https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-actions

In addition, the Teleport Terraform plugin now supports the creation of Machine
ID Bots and Bot Tokens.

### tsh MFA on Windows

tsh 11 adds support for MFA and passwordless logins via Windows Hello and
FIDO2 devices.

### Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect has added support for Access Requests and file upload/download.

### Breaking Changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 11 before upgrading.

#### Removed Github external SSO

Beginning in Teleport 11, GitHub SAML SSO will only be available in our
Enterprise Edition. GitHub SSO without SAML will continue to work with OSS
Teleport.

To keep using GitHub SSO with the OSS Teleport, SAML SSO needs to be disabled
for your GitHub organization. OSS Teleport users can continue to use GitHub SSO
if using a Github Free or Team GitHub Plan.

#### Changed Terraform OIDC connector redirect_url type to array

In Teleport Plugins 11, `redirect_url` property in OIDC connectors created via
a Terraform module expects an array:

```
redirect_url = [ "http://example.com" ]
```

#### Deprecated Quay.io registry

Starting with Teleport 11, Quay.io as a container registry has been deprecated.
Customers should use the new AWS ECR registry to pull [Teleport Docker
images](./docs/pages/installation.mdx#docker).

Quay.io registry support will be removed in a future release.

#### Deprecated old deb/rpm repositories

In Teleport 11, old deb/rpm repositories (deb.releases.teleport.dev and
rpm.releases.teleport.dev) have been deprecated. Customers should use the new
repositories (apt.releases.teleport.dev and yum.releases.teleport.dev) to
[install Teleport](docs/pages/installation.mdx#linux).

Support for our old deb/rpm repositories will be removed in a future release.

#### Changed teleport-kube-agent Helm chart to StatefulSet

Teleport 11 agents will now store their identities in Kubernetes Secrets when
deployed via a Helm chart which eliminates the need for using persistent storage
or static join tokens. Due to this change, Teleport agents are now always
deployed as part of StatefulSet regardless of whether persistent storage is
enabled or not.

Existing agents that were deployed as Kubernetes Deployments (i.e. without
persistent storage) will be automatically converted to StatefulSets during
Teleport 11 Helm upgrade.

#### Removed PostgreSQL backend

The preview PostgreSQL backend was deleted due to performance and scalability
concerns.

#### Removed desktop access support for 32-bit ARM and 386 architectures

32-bit support for desktop access on ARM and 386 architectures has been removed
due to performance issues on these devices.

This also reduces the binary size for these builds, making them slightly more
convenient for smaller resource-constrained devices.

## 10.0.0

Teleport 10 is a major release that brings the following new features.

Platform:

* Passwordless (Preview)
* Resource Access Requests (Preview)
* Proxy Peering (Preview)

Server access:

* IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)
* Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)

Database access:

* Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server database access
* Snowflake database access (Preview)
* ElastiCache/MemoryDB database access (Preview)

Teleport Connect:

* Teleport Connect for server and database access (Preview)

Machine ID:

* Machine ID database access support (Preview)

### Passwordless (Preview)

Teleport 10 introduces passwordless support to your clusters. To use passwordless
users may register a security key with resident credentials or use a built-in
authenticator, like Touch ID.

See the [documentation](./docs/pages/access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx).

### Resource Access Requests (Preview)

Teleport 10 expands just-in-time access requests to allow for requesting access
to specific resources. This lets you grant users the least privileged access
needed for their workflows.

Just-in-time access requests are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### Proxy Peering (Preview)

Proxy peering enables Teleport deployments to scale without an increase in load
from the number of agent connections. This is accomplished by allowing Proxy
Services to tunnel client connections to the desired agent through a neighboring
proxy and decoupling the number of agent connections from the number of Proxies.

Proxy peering can be enabled with the following configurations:

```yaml
auth_service:
  tunnel_strategy:
    type: proxy_peering
    agent_connection_count: 1
```

```yaml
proxy_service:
  peer_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3021
```

Network connectivity between proxy servers to the `peer_listen_addr` is required
for this feature to work.

Proxy peering is only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)

Teleport 10 introduces a new role option to pin the source IP in SSH
certificates. When enabled, the source IP that was used to request certificates
is embedded in the certificate, and SSH servers will reject connection attempts
from other IPs. This protects against attacks where valid credentials are
exfiltrated from disk and copied out into other environments.

IP-based restrictions are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)

Teleport 10 can be configured to automatically create Linux host users upon
login without having to use Teleport's PAM integration. Users can be added to specific
Linux groups and assigned appropriate “sudoer” privileges.

To learn more about configuring automatic user provisioning read the
[documentation](docs/pages/server-access/guides/host-user-creation.mdx).

### Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server database access

Teleport 9 introduced a preview of database access support for Microsoft SQL
Server which didn’t include audit logging of user queries. Teleport 10 captures
users' queries and prepared statements and sends them to the audit log, similarly
to other supported database protocols.

Teleport database access for SQL Server remains in Preview mode with more UX
improvements coming in future releases.

Refer to [the guide](docs/pages/database-access/guides/sql-server-ad.mdx) to set
up access to a SQL Server with Active Directory authentication.

### Snowflake database access (Preview)

Teleport 10 brings support for Snowflake to database access. Administrators can
set up access to Snowflake databases through Teleport for their users with
standard database access features like role-based access control and audit
logging, including query activity.

Connect your Snowflake database to Teleport following the
[documentation](docs/pages/database-access/guides/snowflake.mdx).

### Elasticache/MemoryDB database access (Preview)

Teleport 9 added Redis protocol support to database access. Teleport 10 improves
this integration by adding native support for AWS-hosted Elasticache and
MemoryDB, including auto-discovery and automatic credential management in some
deployment configurations.

Learn more about it in the [documentation](
docs/pages/database-access/guides/redis-aws.mdx).

### Teleport Connect for server and database access (Preview)

Teleport Connect is a graphical macOS application that simplifies access to your
Teleport resources. Teleport Connect 10 supports server access and database access.
Other protocols and Windows support are coming in a future release.

Get Teleport Connect installer from the macOS tab on the downloads page:
https://goteleport.com/download/.

### Machine ID database access support (Preview)

In Teleport 10 we’ve added database access support to Machine ID. Applications
can use Machine ID to access databases protected by Teleport.

You can find Machine ID guide for database access in the
[documentation](docs/pages/machine-id/guides/databases.mdx).

### Breaking changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 10 before upgrading.

#### Auth Service version check

Teleport 10 agents will now refuse to start if they detect that the Auth Service
is more than one major version behind them. You can use the `--skip-version-check` flag to
bypass the version check.

Take a look at component compatibility guarantees in the
[documentation](docs/pages/management/operations/upgrading.mdx).

#### HTTP_PROXY for reverse tunnels

Reverse tunnel connections will now respect `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables.
This may result in reverse tunnel agents not being able to re-establish
connections if the HTTP proxy is set in their environment and does not allow
connections to the Teleport Proxy Service.

Refer to the
[documentation](docs/pages/reference/networking.mdx#http-connect-proxies)
for more details.

#### New APT repos

With Teleport 10 we’ve migrated to new APT repositories that now support
multiple release channels, Teleport versions and OS distributions. The new
repositories have been backfilled with Teleport versions starting from 6.2.31
and we recommend upgrading to them. The old repositories will be maintained for
the foreseeable future.

See the [installation
instructions](docs/pages/server-access/getting-started.mdx#step-14-install-teleport-on-your-linux-host).

#### Removed “tctl access ls”

The `tctl access ls` command that returned information about user server access
within the cluster was removed. Please use a previous `tctl` version if you’d like
to keep using it.

#### Relaxed session join permissions

In previous versions of Teleport users needed full access to a Node/Kubernetes
pod in order to join a session. Teleport 10 relaxes this requirement. Joining
sessions remains deny-by-default but now only `join_sessions` statements are
checked for session join RBAC.

See the [Moderated Sessions
guide](docs/pages/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx) for more
details.

#### GitHub connectors

The GitHub authentication connector’s `teams_to_logins` field is deprecated in favor of the new
`teams_to_roles` field. The old field will be removed in a future release.

#### Teleport FIPS AWS endpoints

Teleport 10 will now automatically use FIPS endpoints for AWS S3 and DynamoDB
when started with the `--fips` flag. You can use the `use_fips_endpoint=false`
connection endpoint option to use regular endpoints for Teleport in FIPS mode,
for example:

```
s3://bucket/path?region=us-east-1&use_fips_endpoint=false
```

See the [S3/DynamoDB backend
documentation](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx) for more information.

## 9.3.9

This release of Teleport contains a security fix, as well as multiple improvements and bug fixes.

### Auth bypass in Moderated Sessions

When checking a user’s roles prior to starting a session, Teleport may have
incorrectly allowed a session to proceed without moderation depending on the
order roles are received from the backend.

## 9.3.4

This release of Teleport contains multiple security, bug fixes and improvements.

### Escalation attack in agent forwarding

When setting up agent forwarding on the node, Teleport did not handle unix socket creation in a secure manner.

This could have given a potential attacker an opportunity to get Teleport to change arbitrary file permissions to the attacker’s user.

### WebSockets CSRF

When handling websocket requests, Teleport did not verify that the provided Bearer token was generated for the correct user.

This could have allowed a malicious low privileged Teleport user to use a social engineering attack to gain higher privileged access on the same Teleport cluster.

### Denial of service in access requests

When accepting an access request, Teleport did not enforce the maximum request reason size.

This could allow a malicious actor to mount a DoS attack by creating an access request with a very large request reason.

### Auth bypass in moderated sessions

When initializing a moderated session, Teleport did not discard participant’s input prior to the moderator joining.

This could prevent a moderator from being able to interrupt a malicious command executed by a participant.

### Other fixes

* Fixed issue with stdin hijacking when per-session MFA is enabled. [#13212](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13212)
* Added support for automatic tags import when running on AWS EC2. [#12593](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12593)
* Added ability to use multiple redirect URLs in OIDC connectors. [#13046](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13046)
* Fixed issue with ANSI escape sequences being broken when using `tsh` on Windows. [#13221](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13221)
* Fixed issue with `tsh ssh` printing extra error upon exit if last command was unsuccessful. [#12903](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12903)
* Added support for Proxy Protocol v2 in MySQL proxy. [#12993](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12993)
* Upgraded to Go `v1.17.11`. [#13104](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13104)
* Added Windows desktops labeling based on their LDAP attributes. [#13238](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13238)
* Improved performance when listing resources for users with many roles. [#13263](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13263)

## 9.3.2

This release of Teleport contains two bug fixes.

* Fixed issue with Machine ID's `tsh` version check. [#13037](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13037)
* Fixed AWS related log spam in database agent when not running on AWS. [#12984](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12984)

## 9.3.0

This release of Teleport contains multiple improvements and bug fixes.

* Fixed issue with `tctl` not taking `TELEPORT_HOME` environment variable into account. [#12738](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12738)
* Fixed issue with Redis `AUTH` command not always authenticating the user in database access. [#12754](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12754)
* Fixed issue with Teleport not starting with deprecated U2F configuration. [#12826](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12826)

* Fixed issue with `teleport configure` failing when given non-existent data directory. [#12806](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12806)
* Fixed issue with `tctl` not outputting debug logs. [#12920](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12920)
* Fixed issue with Kubernetes access not working when using default CA pool. [#12874](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12874)
* Fixed issue with Machine ID not working in TLS routing mode. [#12990](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12990)
* Improved connection performance in large clusters. [#12832](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12832)
* Improved memory usage in large clusters. [#12724](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12724)

### Breaking Changes

Teleport 9.3.0 reduces the minimum GLIBC requirement to 2.18 and enforces more
secure cipher suites for desktop access.

As a result of these changes, desktop access users with desktops running Windows
Server 2012R2 will need to perform [additional
configuration](docs/pages/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx) to force Windows
to use compatible cipher suites.

Windows desktops running Windows Server 2016 and newer will continue to operate
normally - no additional configuration is required.

## 9.2.4

This release of Teleport contains multiple improvements and bug fixes.

* Fixed compatibility issue with agents connected to older auth servers. [#12728](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12728)

## 9.0.0

Teleport 9.0 is a major release that brings:

- Teleport desktop access GA
- Teleport Machine ID Preview
- Various additions to Teleport database access
- Moderated Sessions for server and Kubernetes access

Desktop access adds support for clipboard sharing, session recording, and
per-session MFA.

Teleport Machine ID Preview extends identity-based access to machines. It's the
easiest way to issue, renew, and manage SSH and X.509 certificates for service
accounts, microservices, CI/CD automation and all other forms of
machine-to-machine access.

Database access brings self-hosted Redis support, RDS MariaDB (10.6 and higher)
support, auto-discovery for Redshift clusters, and auto-IAM configuration
improvements to GA. Additionally, this release also brings Microsoft SQL Server
with AD authentication to Preview.

Moderated Sessions enables the creation of sessions where a moderator has to
be present. This feature can be selectively enabled for specific sessions via
RBAC and can be used in conjunction with per-session MFA.

### Desktop access

#### Clipboard Support

Desktop access now supports copying and pasting text between your local
workstation and a remote Windows Desktop. This feature requires a Chromium-based
browser and can be disabled via RBAC.

#### Session Recording

Desktop sessions are now recorded and stored alongside SSH sessions, and can be
viewed in Teleport's web interface. Desktop session recordings are fully
compatible with the RBAC for sessions feature introduced in Teleport 8.1.

#### Per-session MFA

Per-session MFA settings now apply to desktop sessions. This allows cluster
administrators to require an additional MFA "tap" prior to opening a desktop
session. This feature requires a WebAuthn device.

### Machine ID (Preview)

Machine ID allows the creation of machine / bot / service account users who can
automatically issue, renew, and manage SSH and X.509 certificates to facilitate
machine-to-machine access.

Machine ID is a service that programmatically issues and renews short-lived
certificates to any service account (e.g., a CI/CD server) by retrieving
credentials from the Teleport Auth Service. This enables fine-grained role-based
access controls and audit.

Some of the things you can do with Machine ID:

- Machines can retrieve short-lived SSH certificates for CI/CD pipelines.
- Machines can retrieve short-lived X.509 certificates for use with databases or
  applications.
- Configure role-based access controls and locking for machines.
- Capture access events in the audit log.

[Machine ID getting started guide](docs/pages/machine-id/getting-started.mdx)

### Database access

#### Redis

You can now use database access to connect to a self-hosted Redis instance or
Redis cluster and view Redis commands in the Teleport audit log. We will be
adding support for AWS Elasticache in the coming weeks.

[Self-hosted Redis guide](docs/pages/database-access/guides/redis.mdx)

#### SQL Server (Preview)

Teleport 9 includes a preview release of Microsoft SQL Server with Active
Directory authentication support for database access. Audit logging of query
activity is not included in the preview release and will be implemented in a
later 9.x release.

[SQL Server guide](docs/pages/database-access/guides/sql-server-ad.mdx)

#### RDS MariaDB

Teleport 9 updates MariaDB support with auto-discovery and connection to AWS RDS
MariaDB databases using IAM authentication. The minimum MariaDB version that
supports IAM authentication is 10.6.

[Updated RDS guide](docs/pages/database-access/guides/rds.mdx)

#### Other Improvements

In addition, Teleport 9 expands auto-discovery to support Redshift databases and
2 new commands which simplify the database access getting started experience:
"teleport db configure create", which generates Database Service configuration,
and "teleport db configure bootstrap", which configures IAM permissions for the
Database Service when running on AWS.

CLI commands reference:
- [`teleport db configure
  create`](./docs/pages/database-access/reference/cli.mdx#teleport-db-configure-create)
- [`teleport db configure bootstrap`](./docs/pages/database-access/reference/cli.mdx#teleport-db-configure-bootstrap)

### Moderated Sessions

With Moderated Sessions, Teleport administrators can define policies that allow
users to invite other users to participate in SSH or Kubernetes sessions as
observers, moderators or peers.

[Moderated Sessions guide](docs/pages/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx)

### Breaking Changes

#### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 support was deprecated in Teleport 8 and has now been removed.

#### Desktop access

desktop access now authenticates to LDAP using X.509 client certificates.
Support for the `password_file` configuration option has been removed.

## 8.0.0

Teleport 8.0 is a major release of Teleport that contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### Windows desktop access Preview

Teleport 8.0 includes a preview of the Windows desktop access feature, allowing
users passwordless login to Windows Desktops via any modern web browser.

Teleport users can connect to Active Directory enrolled Windows hosts running
Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer Windows versions.

To try this feature yourself, check out our
[Getting Started Guide](docs/pages/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx).

Review the desktop access design in:

- [RFD #33](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0033-desktop-access.md)
- [RFD #34](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0034-desktop-access-windows.md)
- [RFD #35](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0035-desktop-access-windows-authn.md)
- [RFD #37](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0037-desktop-access-protocol.md)

#### TLS Routing

In TLS routing mode all client connections are wrapped in TLS and multiplexed on
a single Teleport proxy port.

TLS routing can be enabled by including the following auth service configuration:

```yaml
auth_service:
  proxy_listener_mode: multiplex
  ...
```

and setting proxy configuration version to `v2` to prevent legacy listeners from
being created:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_service:
  ...
```

#### AWS CLI

Teleport application access extends AWS console support to CLI . Users are able
to log into their AWS console using `tsh apps login` and use `tsh aws` commands
to interact with AWS APIs.

See more info in the
[documentation](docs/pages/application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx).

#### Application and Database Dynamic Registration

With dynamic registration users are able to manage applications and databases
without needing to update static YAML configuration or restart application or
database agents.

See dynamic registration guides for
[apps](docs/pages/application-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx)
and
[databases](docs/pages/database-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx).

#### RDS Automatic Discovery

With RDS auto discovery Teleport database agents can automatically discover RDS
instances and Aurora clusters in an AWS account.

See updated
[RDS guide](docs/pages/database-access/guides/rds.mdx) for
more information.

#### WebAuthn

WebAuthn support enables Teleport users to use modern second factor options,
including Apple FaceID and TouchID.

In addition, the Teleport Web UI includes new second factor management tools,
enabling users to configure and update their second factor devices via their
web browser.

Lastly, our UI becomes more secure by requiring an additional second factor
confirmation for certain privileged actions (editing roles for second factor
confirmation, for example).

### Improvements

* Added support for [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com) to Database
  Access. [#8505](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8505)
* Reduced network utilization on large clusters during login.
  [#8471](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8471)
* Added metrics and added the ability for `tctl top` to show network utilization
  for resource propagation.
  [#8338](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8338)
  [#8603](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8603)
  [#8491](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8491)
* Added support for account recovery and cancellation.
  [#6769](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6769)
* Added per-session MFA support to database access.
  [#8270](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8270)
* Added support for profile specific `kubeconfig`.
  [#7840](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7840)

### Fixes

* Fixed issues with web applications that utilized
  [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource)
  with application access.
  [#8359](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8359)
* Fixed issue were interactive sessions would always return exit code 0.
  [#8081](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8081)
* Fixed issue where JWT signer was omitted from bootstrap logic.
  [#8119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8119)

### Breaking Changes

#### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 support will be deprecated in Teleport 8 and removed in Teleport 9.

Teleport 8 will continue to receive security patches for about 9 months after
which it will be EOL. Users are encouraged to upgrade to CentOS 7 in that time
frame.

#### Updated  dependencies

New run time dependencies have been added to Teleport 8 due to the inclusion of
Rust in the build chain. Teleport 8 requires `libgcc_s.so` and `libm.so` be
installed on systems running Teleport.

Users of [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
container images are encouraged to use the
[gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/blob/main/examples/rust/Dockerfile)
image to run Teleport.

```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11
```

Alpine users are recommended to install the `libgcc` package in addition to any
glibc compatibility layer they have already been using.

```
apk --update --no-cache add libgcc
```

#### Database access Certificates

With the `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` flag removed in Go 1.17, database access users
will no longer be able to connect to databases that include their hostname in
the `CommonName` field of the presented certificate. Users are recommended to
update their database certificates to include hostname in the
`Subject Alternative Name` extension instead.

Subscribe to Github issue
[#7636](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/7636) which will add
ability to control level of TLS verification as a workaround.

#### Role Changes

New clusters will no longer have the default `admin` role, it has been replaced
with 3 smaller scoped roles: `access`, `auditor`, and `editor`.

## 7.0.0

Teleport 7.0 is a major release of Teleport that contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

#### AWS Console

Added support for [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console) to Teleport application access. [#7590](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7590)

Teleport application access can now automatically sign users into the AWS Management Console using [Identity federation](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation). View AWS Management Console [guide](docs/pages/application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx) for more details.

#### Restricted Sessions

Added the ability to block network traffic (IPv4 and IPv6) on a per-SSH session basis. Implemented using BPF tooling which required kernel 5.8 or above. [#7099](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7099)

#### Enhanced Session Recording

Updated Enhanced Session Recording to no longer require the installation of external compilers like `bcc-tools`. Implemented using BPF tooling which required kernel 5.8 or above. [#6027](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6027)

### Improvements

* Added the ability to terminate database access certificates when the certificate expires. [#5476](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5476)
* Added additional FedRAMP compliance controls, such as custom disconnect and MOTD messages. [#6091](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6091) [#7396](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7396)

* Added the ability to partially configure a cluster. [#5857](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5857) [RFD #28](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0028-cluster-config-resources.md)
* Added the ability to disable port forwarding on a per-host basis. [#6989](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6989)
* Added ability to configure `tsh` home directory. [#7035](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7035/files)
* Added ability to generate OpenSSH client configuration snippets using `tsh config`. [#7437](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7437)
* Added default-port detection to `tsh` [#6374](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6374)
* Improved performance of the Web UI for users with many roles. [#7588](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7588)

### Fixes

* Fixed a memory leak that could affect etcd users. [#7631](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7631)
* Fixed an issue where `tsh login` could fail if the user had multiple public addresses defined on the proxy. [#7368](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7368)

### Breaking Changes

#### Enhanced Session Recording

Enhanced Session Recording has been updated to use CO-RE BPF executables. This makes deployment much simpler, you no longer have to install `bcc-tools`, but comes with a higher minimum kernel version of 5.8 and above. [#6027](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6027)

#### Kubernetes access

Kubernetes access will no longer automatically register a cluster named after the Teleport cluster if the proxy is running within a Kubernetes cluster. Users wishing to retain this functionality now have to explicitly set `kube_cluster_name`. [#6786](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6786)

#### `tsh`

`tsh login` has been updated to no longer change the current Kubernetes context. While `tsh login` will write credentials to `kubeconfig` it will only update your context if `tsh login --kube-cluster` or `tsh kube login <kubeCluster>` is used. [#6045](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6045)

## 6.2

Teleport 6.2 contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

**Note:** the DynamoDB indexing change described below may cause rate-limiting
errors from AWS APIs and is slow on large deployments (1000+ existing audit
events). The next patch release, v6.2.1, will improve the migration performance.
If you run a large DynamoDB-based cluster, we advise you to wait for v6.2.1
before upgrading.

### New Features

#### Added Amazon Redshift Support

Added support for [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift) to Teleport database access.[#6479](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6479).

View the [database access with Redshift on AWS guide](docs/pages/database-access/guides/postgres-redshift.mdx) for more details.

### Improvements

### Breaking Changes

#### Agent Forwarding

Teleport 6.2 brings a potentially backward incompatible change with `tsh` agent forwarding.

Prior to Teleport 6.2, `tsh ssh -A` would create an in-memory SSH agent from your `~/.tsh` directory and forward that agent to the target host.

Starting in Teleport 6.2 `tsh ssh -A` by default now forwards your system SSH agent (available at `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Users wishing to retain the prior behavior can use `tsh ssh -o "ForwardAgent local"`.

For more details see [RFD 22](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0022-ssh-agent-forwarding.md) and implementation in [#6525](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6525).

#### DynamoDB Indexing Change

DynamoDB users should note that the events backend indexing strategy has
changed and a data migration will be triggered after upgrade. For optimal
performance perform this migration with only one auth server online. It may
take some time and progress will be periodically written to the auth server
log. During this migration, only events that have been migrated will appear in
the Web UI. After completion, all events will be available.

For more details see [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) and implementation in [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583).

### New Features

#### U2F for Kubernetes and SSH sessions

Added support for U2F authentication on every SSH and Kubernetes "connection" (a single `tsh ssh` or `kubectl` call). This is an advanced security feature that protects users against compromises of their on-disk Teleport certificates. Per-session MFA can be enforced cluster-wide or only for some specific roles.

For more details see [Per-Session
MFA](docs/pages/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa.mdx) documentation or
[RFD
14](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0014-session-2FA.md)
and [RFD
15](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0015-2fa-management.md)
for technical details.

## 6.0.0

Teleport 6.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes.

We have implemented [database
access](./docs/pages/database-access/introduction.mdx), open sourced role-based
access control (RBAC), and added official API and a Go client library.

Users can review the [6.0 milestone](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/33?closed=1) on Github for more details.

### New Features

#### Database access

Review the database access design in [RFD #11](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0011-database-access.md).

With database access users can connect to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases using short-lived certificates, configure SSO authentication and role-based access controls for databases, and capture SQL query activity in the audit log.

##### Getting Started

Configure database access following the [Getting Started](./docs/pages/database-access/introduction.mdx#getting-started/) guide.

##### Guides

* [AWS RDS/Aurora
  PostgreSQL](docs/pages/database-access/guides/rds.mdx)
* [Self-hosted PostgreSQL](docs/pages/database-access/guides/postgres-self-hosted.mdx)
* [Self-hosted MySQL](docs/pages/database-access/guides/mysql-self-hosted.mdx)
* [GUI clients](docs/pages/connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx)

##### Resources

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for database access, check out the [RBAC](./docs/pages/database-access/introduction.mdx) section.

[Architecture](./docs/pages/database-access/introduction.mdx) provides a more in-depth look at database access internals such as networking and security.

See [Reference](./docs/pages/database-access/reference.mdx) for an overview of database access related configuration and CLI commands.

Finally, check out [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/pages/database-access/faq.mdx).

#### OSS RBAC

Open source RBAC support was introduced in [RFD #7](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0007-rbac-oss.md).

RBAC support gives OSS administrators more granular access controls to servers and other resources with a cluster (like session recording access). An example of an RBAC policy could be: "admins can do anything, developers must never touch production servers and interns can only SSH into staging servers as guests"

In addition, some Access Workflow Plugins will now become available to open source users.

* Access Workflows Golang SDK and API
* Slack
* Gitlab
* Mattermost
* JIRA Plugin
* PagerDuty Plugin

#### Client libraries and API

API and Client Libraries support was introduced in [RFD #10](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0010-api.md).

The new API and client library reduces the dependencies needed to use the Teleport API as well as making it easier to use. An example of using the new API is below.

```go
// Create a client connected to the Auth server with an exported identity file.
clt, err := client.NewClient(client.Config{
  Addrs: []string{"auth.example.com:3025"},
  Credentials: []client.Credentials{
    client.LoadIdentityFile("identity.pem"),
  },
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v.", err)
}
defer clt.Close()

// Create a Access Request.
accessRequest, err := types.NewAccessRequest(uuid.New(), "access-admin", "admin")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to build access request: %v.", err)
}
if err = clt.CreateAccessRequest(ctx, accessRequest); err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create access request: %v.", err)
}
```

### Improvements

* Added `utmp`/`wtmp` support for SSH in [#5491](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5491).
* Added the ability to set a Kubernetes specific public address in [#5611](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5611).
* Added Proxy Protocol support to Kubernetes access in [#5299](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5299).
* Added ACME ([Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) support to make getting and using TLS certificates easier. [#5177](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5177).
* Added the ability to manage local users to the Web UI in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Added the ability to preserve timestamps when using `tsh scp` in [#2889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2889).

### Fixes

* Fixed authentication failure when logging in via CLI with Access Workflows after removing `.tsh` directory in [#5323](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5323).
* Fixed `tsh login` failure when `--proxy` differs from actual proxy public address in [#5380](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5380).
* Fixed session playback issues in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Fixed several UX issues in [#5559](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5559), [#5568](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5568), [#4965](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4965), and [#5057](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5057).

### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport) to upgrade your cluster.

Note, for clusters using GitHub SSO and Trusted Clusters, when upgrading SSO users will lose connectivity to leaf clusters. Local users will not be affected.

To restore connectivity to leaf clusters for SSO users, leaf admins should update the `trusted_cluster` role mapping resource like below.

```yaml
kind: trusted_cluster
version: v2
metadata:
   name: "zztop-oss"
spec:
   enabled: true
   token: "bar"
   web_proxy_addr: 172.10.1.1:3080
   tunnel_addr: 172.10.1.1:3024
   role_map:
   - remote: "admin"
     local: ['admin']
   - remote: "^(github-.*)$"
     local: ['admin']
```

## 5.1.0

This release of Teleport adds a new feature.

* Support for creating and assuming Access Workflow requests from within the Web UI (first step toward full Workflow UI support: [#4937](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4937)).

## 5.0.2

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5119).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 5.0.2 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.


## 5.0.1

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Always set expiry times on server resource in heartbeats [#5008](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5008)
* Fixes streaming k8s responses (`kubectl logs -f`, `kubectl run -it`, etc) [#5009](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5009)
* Multiple fixes for the k8s forwarder [#5038](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5038)

## 5.0.0

Teleport 5.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes. Users can review [5.0 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/39?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

Teleport 5.0 introduces two distinct features: Teleport application access and significant Kubernetes access improvements - multi-cluster support.

##### Teleport application access

Teleport can now be used to provide secure access to web applications. This new feature was built with the express intention of securing internal apps which might have once lived on a VPN or had a simple authorization and authentication mechanism with little to no audit trail. application access works with everything from dashboards to single page Javascript applications (SPA).

application access uses mutually authenticated reverse tunnels to establish a secure connection with the Teleport unified Access Plane which can then becomes the single ingress point for all traffic to an internal application.

Adding an application follows the same UX as adding SSH servers or Kubernetes clusters, starting with creating a static or dynamic invite token.

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=app
```

Then simply start Teleport with a few new flags.

```sh
$ teleport start --roles=app --token=xyz --auth-server=proxy.example.com:3080 \
    --app-name="example-app" \
    --app-uri="http://localhost:8080"
```

This command will start an app server that proxies the application "example-app" running at `http://localhost:8080` at the public address `https://example-app.example.com`.

Applications can also be configured using the new `app_service` section in `teleport.yaml`.

```yaml
app_service:
   # Teleport application access is enabled.
   enabled: yes
   # We've added a default sample app that will check
   # that Teleport application access is working
   # and output JWT tokens.
   # https://dumper.teleport.example.com:3080/
   debug_app: true
   apps:
   # application access can be used to proxy any HTTP endpoint.
   # Note: Name can't include any spaces and should be DNS-compatible A-Za-z0-9-._
   - name: "internal-dashboard"
     uri: "http://10.0.1.27:8000"
     # By default Teleport will make this application
     # available on a sub-domain of your Teleport proxy's hostname
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # - thus the importance of setting up wildcard DNS.
     # If you want, it's possible to set up a custom public url.
     # DNS records should point to the proxy server.
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # Example Public URL for the internal-dashboard app.
     # public_addr: "internal-dashboard.acme.com"
     # Optional labels
     # Labels can be combined with RBAC rules to provide access.
     labels:
       customer: "acme"
       env: "production"
     # Optional dynamic labels
     commands:
     - name: "os"
       command: ["/usr/bin/uname"]
       period: "5s"
     # A proxy can support multiple applications. application access
     # can also be deployed with a Teleport node.
     - name: "arris"
       uri: "http://localhost:3001"
       public_addr: "arris.example.com"
```

Application access requires two additional changes. DNS must be updated to point the application domain to the proxy and the proxy must be loaded with a TLS certificate for the domain. Wildcard DNS and TLS certificates can be used to simplify deployment.

```yaml
# When adding the app_service certificates are required to provide a TLS
# connection. The certificates are managed by the proxy_service
proxy_service:
  # We've extended support for https certs. Teleport can now load multiple
  # TLS certificates. In the below example we've obtained a wildcard cert
  # that'll be used for proxying the applications.
  # The correct certificate is selected based on the hostname in the HTTPS
  # request using SNI.
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
```

You can learn more at [https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/application-access/](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/application-access/)

##### Teleport Kubernetes access

Teleport 5.0 also introduces two highly requested features for Kubernetes.

* The ability to connect multiple Kubernetes Clusters to the Teleport Access Plane, greatly reducing operational complexity.
* Complete Kubernetes audit log capture [#4526](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4526), going beyond the existing `kubectl exec` capture.

For a full overview please review the [Kubernetes RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0005-kubernetes-service.md).

To support these changes, we've introduced a new service. This moves Teleport Kubernetes configuration from the `proxy_service` into its own dedicated `kubernetes_service` section.

When adding the new Kubernetes service, a new type of join token is required.

```bash
tctl tokens add --type=kube
```

Example configuration for the new `kubernetes_service`:

```yaml
# ...
kubernetes_service:
   enabled: yes
   listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027
   kubeconfig_file: /secrets/kubeconfig
```

Note: a Kubernetes port still needs to be configured in the `proxy_service` via `kube_listen_addr`.

#### New "tsh kube" commands

`tsh kube` commands are used to query registered clusters and switch `kubeconfig` context:

```sh
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=awly

# list all registered clusters
$ tsh kube ls
Cluster Name       Status
-------------      ------
a.k8s.example.com  online
b.k8s.example.com  online
c.k8s.example.com  online

# on login, kubeconfig is pointed at the first cluster (alphabetically)
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com

# but all clusters are populated as contexts
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                     CLUSTER             AUTHINFO
*         proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# switch between different clusters:
$ tsh kube login c.k8s.example.com

# the traditional way is also supported:
$ kubectl config use-context proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# check current cluster
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com
```

Other Kubernetes changes:

* Support k8s clusters behind firewall/NAT using a single Teleport cluster [#3667](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3667)
* Support multiple k8s clusters with a single Teleport proxy instance [#3952](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3952)

##### Additional User and Token Resource

We've added two new RBAC resources; these provide the ability to limit token creation and to list and modify Teleport users:

```yaml
- resources: [user]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
- resources: [token]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
```

Learn more about [Teleport's RBAC Resources](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/enterprise/ssh-rbac/)

##### Cluster Labels

Teleport 5.0 also adds the ability to set labels on Trusted Clusters. The labels are set when creating a trusted cluster invite token. This lets teams use the same RBAC controls used on nodes to approve or deny access to clusters. This can be especially useful for MSPs that connect hundreds of customers' clusters - when combined with Access Workflows, cluster access can easily be delegated. Learn more by reviewing our [Truster Cluster Setup & RBAC Docs](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/trustedclusters/#dynamic-join-tokens)

Creating a trusted cluster join token for a production environment:

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=trusted_cluster --labels=env=prod
```

```yaml
kind: role
#...
  deny:
    # cluster labels control what clusters user can connect to. The wildcard ('*')
    # means any cluster. By default, deny rules are empty to preserve backwards
    # compatibility
    cluster_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

##### Teleport UI Updates

Teleport 5.0 also iterates on the UI Refresh from 4.3. We've moved the cluster list into our sidebar and have added an Application launcher. For customers moving from 4.4 to 5.0, you'll notice that we have moved session recordings back to their own dedicated section.

Other updates:

* We now provide local user management via `https://[cluster-url]/web/users`, providing the ability to easily edit, reset and delete local users.
* Teleport Node & App Install scripts. This is currently an Enterprise-only feature that provides customers with an easy 'auto-magic' installer script. Enterprise customers can enable this feature by modifying the 'token' resource. See note above.
* We've added a Waiting Room for customers using Access Workflows. [Docs](./docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins/index.mdx)

##### Signed RPM and Releases

Starting with Teleport 5.0, we now provide an RPM repo for stable releases of Teleport. We've also started signing our RPMs to provide assurance that you're always using an official build of Teleport.

See https://rpm.releases.teleport.dev/ for more details.

#### Improvements

* Added `--format=json` playback option for `tsh play`. For example `tsh play --format=json ~/play/0c0b81ed-91a9-4a2a-8d7c-7495891a6ca0.tar | jq '.event` can be used to show all events within an a local archive. [#4578](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4578)
* Added support for continuous backups and auto scaling for DynamoDB. [#4780](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4780)
* Added a Linux ARM64/ARMv8 (64-bit) Release. [#3383](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3383)
* Added `https_keypairs` field which replaces `https_key_file` and `https_cert_file`. This allows administrators to load multiple HTTPS certs for Teleport application access. Teleport 5.0 is backwards compatible with the old format, but we recommend updating your configuration to use `https_keypairs`.

Enterprise Only:

* `tctl` can load credentials from `~/.tsh` [#4678](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4678)
* Teams can require a user submitted reason when using Access Workflows [#4573](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4573#issuecomment-720777443)

#### Fixes

* Updated `tctl` to always format resources as lists in JSON/YAML. [#4281](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4281)
* Updated `tsh status` to now print Kubernetes status. [#4348](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4348)
* Fixed intermittent issues with `loginuid.so`. [#3245](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3245)
* Reduced `access denied to Proxy` log spam. [#2920](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2920)
* Various AMI fixes: paths are now consistent with other Teleport packages and configuration files will not be overwritten on reboot.

#### Documentation

We've added an [API Guide](docs/pages/api/introduction.mdx) to simply developing applications against Teleport.

#### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport).

* Optional: Consider updating `https_key_file` & `https_cert_file` to our new `https_keypairs:` format.
* Optional: Consider migrating Kubernetes access from `proxy_service` to `kubernetes_service` after the upgrade.

### 4.4.6

This release of teleport contains a security fix and a bug fix.

on login, allowing users to be configured such that no nodes can
be accessed without externally granted roles.

* Teleport UI support for automatically generating access requests and
assuming new roles upon approval (access requests were previously
only available in `tsh`).

* New `claims_to_roles` mapping that can use claims from external
identity providers to determine which roles a user can request.

* Various minor API improvements to help make requests easier to
manage and audit, including support for human-readable
request/approve/deny reasons and structured annotations.

### 4.4.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.4 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/40?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Concurrent Session Control

This addition to Teleport helps customers obtain AC-10 control. We now provide two new optional configuration values: `max_connections` and `max_sessions`.

###### `max_connections`

This value is the total number of concurrent sessions within a cluster to nodes running Teleport. This value is applied at a per user level. If you set `max_connections` to `1`, a `tsh` user would only be able to `tsh ssh` into one node at a time.

###### `max_sessions` per connection

This value limits the total number of session channels which can be established across a single SSH connection (typically used for interactive terminals or remote exec operations). This is for cases where nodes have Teleport set up, but a user is using OpenSSH to connect to them. It is essentially equivalent to the `MaxSessions` configuration value accepted by `sshd`.

```yaml
spec:
  options:
    # Optional: Required to be set for AC-10 Compliance
    max_connections: 2
    # Optional: To match OpenSSH behavior set to 10
    max_sessions: 10
```

###### `session_control_timeout`

A new `session_control_timeout` configuration value has been added to the `auth_service` configuration block of the Teleport config file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.

```yaml
auth_service:
  session_control_timeout: 2m # default
# ...
```

#### Session Streaming Improvements

Teleport 4.4 includes a complete refactoring of our event system. This resolved a few customer bug reports such as [#3800: Events overwritten in DynamoDB](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3800) and [#3182: Teleport consuming all disk space with multipart uploads](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3182).

Along with foundational improvements, 4.4 includes two new experimental `session_recording` options: `node-sync` and `proxy-sync`.
NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.

```yaml
# This section configures the 'auth service':
auth_service:
    # Optional setting for configuring session recording. Possible values are:
    #     "node"  : sessions will be recorded on the node level (the default)
    #     "proxy" : recording on the proxy level, see "recording proxy mode" section.
    #     "off"   : session recording is turned off
    #
    #     EXPERIMENTAL *-sync modes: proxy and node send logs directly to S3 or other
    #     storage without storing the records on disk at all. This mode will kill a
    #     connection if network connectivity is lost.
    #     NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and
    #     nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.
    #
    #     "node-sync" : sessions recording will be streamed from node -> auth -> storage
    #     "proxy-sync : sessions recording will be streamed from proxy -> auth -> storage
    #
    session_recording: "node-sync"
```

## 4.3.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.3 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/37?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Web UI

Teleport 4.3 includes a completely redesigned Web UI. The new Web UI expands the management functionality of a Teleport cluster and the user experience of using Teleport to make it easier and simpler to use. Teleport's new terminal provides a quick jumping-off point to access nodes and nodes on other clusters via the web.

Teleport's Web UI now exposes Teleport’s Audit log, letting auditors and administrators view Teleport access events, SSH events, recording session, and enhanced session recording all in one view.

##### Teleport Plugins

Teleport 4.3 introduces four new plugins that work out of the box with [Approval Workflow](./docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins/index.mdx).

#### Upgrade Notes

Always follow the [recommended upgrade procedure](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport?utm_source=github&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=4_3) to upgrade to this version.

##### New Signing Algorithm

If you’re upgrading an existing version of Teleport, you may want to consider rotating CA to SHA-256 or SHA-512 for RSA SSH certificate signatures. The previous default was SHA-1, which is now considered to be weak against brute-force attacks. SHA-1 certificate signatures are also [no longer accepted](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) by OpenSSH versions 8.2 and above. All new Teleport clusters will default to SHA-512 based signatures. To upgrade an existing cluster, set the following in your `teleport.yaml`:

```
teleport:
    ca_signature_algo: "rsa-sha2-512"
```

Rotate the cluster CA, following [these docs](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#certificate-rotation?utm_source=github&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=4_3).

##### Web UI

Due to the number of changes included in the redesigned Web UI, some URLs and functionality have shifted. Refer to the following ticket for more details. [#3580](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3580)

##### RBAC for Audit Log and Recorded Sessions

Teleport 4.3 has made the audit log accessible via the Web UI. Enterprise customers
can limit access by changing the options on the new `event` resource.

```yaml
# list and read audit log, including audit events and recorded sessions
- resources: [event]
  verbs: [list, read]
```

##### Kubernetes Permissions

The minimum set of Kubernetes permissions that need to be granted to Teleport proxies has been updated. If you use the Kubernetes integration, please make sure that the ClusterRole used by the proxy has [sufficient permissions](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/kubernetes_ssh#impersonation).

##### Path prefix for etcd

The [etcd backend](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#using-etcd) now correctly uses the “prefix” config value when storing data. Upgrading from 4.2 to 4.3 will migrate the data as needed at startup. Make sure you follow our Teleport [upgrade guidance](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport).

**Note: If you use an etcd backend with a non-default prefix and need to downgrade from 4.3 to 4.2, you should [backup Teleport data and restore it](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#backing-up-teleport) into the downgraded cluster.**

## 4.2.12

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2020-15216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15216) by updating github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig.

### Details
A vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` library which is used by Teleport to validate the
signatures of XML files used to configure SAML 2.0 connectors. With a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely
bypass XML signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one.

### Actions
The `goxmldsig` library has been updated upstream and Teleport 4.2.12 includes the fix. Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta,
Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.2.12 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.2.11

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Fixed an issue that prevented upload of session archives to NFS volumes. [#3780](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3780)

## 4.2.7

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.1.11 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.1.10

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

## 4.0.0

This is a major Teleport release which introduces support for Teleport Internet of Things (IoT). In addition to this new feature this release includes usability, performance, and bug fixes listed below.

### New Features

#### Teleport for IoT

With Teleport 4.0, nodes gain the ability to use reverse tunnels to dial back to a Teleport cluster to bypass firewall restrictions. This allows connections even to nodes that a cluster does not have direct network access to. Customers that have been using Trusted Clusters to achieve this can now utilize a unified interface to access all nodes within their infrastructure.

#### FedRamp Compliance

With this release of Teleport, we have built out the foundation to help Teleport Enterprise customers build and meet the requirements in a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP). This includes a FIPS 140-2 friendly build of Teleport Enterprise as well as a variety of improvements to aid in complying with security controls even in FedRAMP High environments.

### Improvements

* Teleport now support 10,000 remote connections to a single Teleport cluster. [Using our recommend hardware setup.](./docs/pages/management/operations/scaling.mdx#hardware-recommendations)
* Added ability to delete node using `tctl rm`. [#2685](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2685)
* Output of `tsh ls` is now sorted by node name. [#2534](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2534)

### Bug Fixes

* Switched to `xdg-open` to open a browser window on Linux. [#2536](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2536)
* Increased SSO callback timeout to 180 seconds. [#2533](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2533)
* Set permissions on TTY similar to OpenSSH. [#2508](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2508)

The lists of improvements and bug fixes above mention only the significant changes, please take a look at the complete list on Github for more.

### Upgrading

Teleport 4.0 is backwards compatible with Teleport 3.2 and later. [Follow the recommended upgrade procedure to upgrade to this version.](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#upgrading-teleport)

Note that due to substantial changes between Teleport 3.2 and 4.0, we recommend creating a backup of the backend datastore (DynamoDB, etcd, or dir) before upgrading a cluster to Teleport 4.0 to allow downgrades.

#### Notes on compatibility

Teleport has always validated host certificates when a client connects to a server, however prior to Teleport 4.0, Teleport did not validate the host the user requests a connection to is in the list of principals on the certificate. To ensure a seamless upgrade, make sure the hosts you connect to have the appropriate address set in `public_addr` in `teleport.yaml` before upgrading.

This vulnerability only affects authenticated clients, there is no known way to exploit this vulnerability outside the cluster for unauthenticated clients.
* Upgraded Go to 1.11.4 to mitigate CVE-2018-16875: CPU denial of service in chain validation Go.

## 2.6.0

This release of Teleport brings new features, significant performance and
usability improvements as well usual bugfixes.

During this release cycle, the Teleport source code has been audited for
security vulnerabilities by Cure53 and this release (2.6.0) contains patches
for the discovered problems.

#### New Features

* Support for DynamoDB for storing the audit log events. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for Amazon S3 for storing the recorded SSH sessions. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for rotating certificate authorities (CA rotation). [#1899] (https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1899)
* Integration with Linux PAM (pluggable authentication modules) subsystem. [#742](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/742) and [#1766](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1766)
* The new CLI command `tsh status` shows users which Teleport clusters they are authenticated with. [#1628](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1628)

Additionally, Teleport 2.6.0 has been submitted to the AWS marketplace. Soon
AWS users will be able to create properly configured, secure and highly
available Teleport clusters with ease.

#### Configuration Changes

* Role templates (depreciated in Teleport 2.3) were fully removed. We recommend
  migrating to role variables which are documented [here](./docs/pages/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx)

* Resource names (like roles, connectors, trusted clusters) can no longer
  contain unicode or other special characters. Update the names of all user
  created resources to only include characters, hyphens, and dots.

* `advertise_ip` has been deprecated and replaced with `public_addr` setting. See [#1803](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1803)
  The existing configuration files will still work, but we advise Teleport
  administrators to update it to reflect the new format.

* Teleport no longer uses `boltdb` back-end for storing cluster state _by
  default_.  The new default is called `dir` and it uses simple JSON files
  stored in `/var/lib/teleport/backend`. This change applies to brand new
  Teleport installations, the existing clusters will continue to use `boltdb`.

* The default set of enabled cryptographic primitives has been
  updated to reflect the latest state of SSH and TLS security. [#1856](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1856).

#### Bug Fixes

The list of most visible bug fixes in this release:

* `tsh` now properly handles Ctrl+C [#1882](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1882)
* High CPU utilization on ARM platforms during daemon start-up. [#1886](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1886)
* Terminal window size can get out of sync on AWS. [#1874](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1874)
* Some CLI commands print errors twice. [#1889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1889)
* SSH session playback can be interrupted for long sessions. [#1774](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1774)
* Processing `HUP` UNIX signal is unreliable when `teleport` daemon runs under `systemd`. [#1844](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1844)

## 2.5.1

This release of Teleport fixes a regression in Teleport binaries.

#### Bug Fixes

* Binaries for macOS have been rebuilt to resolve "certificate signed by a unknown authority" issue.

## 2.5.0

This is a major release of Teleport. Its goal is to make cloud-native
deployments easier. Numerous AWS users have contributed feedback to this
release, which includes:

#### New Features

* Auth servers in highly available (HA) configuration can share the same `/var/lib/teleport`
  data directory when it's hosted on NFS (or AWS EFS).
  [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)

* There is now an AWS reference deployment in `examples/aws` directory.  It
  uses Terraform and demonstrates how to deploy large Teleport clusters on AWS
  using best practices like auto-scaling groups, security groups, secrets
  management, load balancers, etc.

* The Teleport daemon now implements built-in connection draining which allows
  zero-downtime upgrades.
  [See documentation](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#graceful-restarts).

* Dynamic join tokens for new nodes can now be explicitly set via `tctl node add --token`.
  This allows Teleport admins to use an external mechanism for generating
  cluster invitation tokens.
  [#1615](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1615)

* Teleport now correctly manages certificates for accessing proxies behind a
  load balancer with the same domain name. The new configuration parameter
  `public_addr` must be used for this.
  [#1174](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1174).

#### Improvements

* Switching to a new TLS-based auth server API improves performance of large clusters.
  [#1528](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* Session recordings are now compressed by default using gzip. This reduces storage
  requirements by up to 80% in our real-world tests.
  [#1579](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* More user-friendly authentication errors in Teleport audit log helps Teleport admins
  troubleshoot configuration errors when integrating with SAML/OIDC providers.
  [#1554](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1554),
  [#1553](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1553),
  [#1599](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1599)

* `tsh` client will now report if a server's API is no longer compatible.

#### Bug Fixes

* `tsh logout` will now correctly log out from all active Teleport sessions. This is useful
  for users who're connected to multiple Teleport clusters at the same time.
  [#1541](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1541)

* When parsing YAML, Teleport now supports `--` list item separator to create
  multiple resources with a single `tctl create` command.
  [#1663](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1663)

* Fixed a panic in the Web UI backend [#1558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1558)

#### Behavior Changes

Certain components of Teleport behave differently in version 2.5. It is important to
note that these changes are not breaking Teleport functionality. They improve
Teleport behavior on large clusters deployed on highly dynamic cloud
environments such as AWS. This includes:

* Session list in the Web UI is now limited to 1,000 sessions.
* The audit log and recorded session storage has been moved from `/var/lib/teleport/log`
  to `/var/lib/teleport/log/<auth-server-id>`. This is related to [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)
  described above.
* When connecting a trusted cluster users can no longer pick an arbitrary name for them.
  Their own (local) names will be used, i.e. the `cluster_name` setting now defines how
  the cluster is seen from the outside.
  [#1543](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1543)

## 2.0.6

### Bugfixes

* Fixed regression in TLP-01-009.

## 2.0.5

Teleport 2.0.5 contains a variety of security fixes. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 2.0.0 and above to upgrade to 2.0.5.

The most pressing issues (a phishing attack which can potentially be used to extract plaintext credentials and an attack where an already authenticated user can escalate privileges) can be resolved by upgrading the web proxy. However, however all nodes need to be upgraded to mitigate all vulnerabilities.

### Bugfixes

* Patch for TLP-01-001 and TLP-01-003: Check redirect.
* Patch for TLP-01-004: Always check is namespace is valid.
* Patch for TLP-01-005: Check user principal when joining session.
* Patch for TLP-01-006 and TLP-01-007: Validate Session ID.
* Patch for TLP-01-008: Use a fake hash for password authentication if user does not exist.
* Patch for TLP-01-009: Command injection in scp.
