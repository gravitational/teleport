# Changelog

## 16.0.0 (xx/xx/xx)

### Breaking changes

#### Opsgenie plugin annotations

Opsgenie plugin users, role annotations must now contain
`teleport.dev/notify-services` to receive notification on Opsgenie.
`teleport.dev/schedules` is now the label used to determine auto approval flow.
See [the Opsgenie plugin documentation](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins/opsgenie.mdx)
for setup instructions.

#### Teleport Assist has been removed

Teleport Assist chat has been removed from Teleport 16. `auth_service.assist` and `proxy_service.assist`
options have been removed from the configuration. Teleport will not start if these options are present.

During the migration from v15 to v16, the options mentioned above should be removed from the configuration.

#### DynamoDB permission requirements have changed

Teleport clusters using the dynamodb backend must now have the `dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem`
permission. For a full list of all required permissions see the Teleport [Backend Reference](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx#dynamodb).

#### Disabling multi-factor authentication_type

Support for disabling multi-factor authentication has been removed

#### Machine ID and OpenSSH client config changes

Users with custom `ssh_config` should modify their ProxyCommand to use the new,
more performant, `tbot ssh-proxy-command`. See the
[v16 upgrade guide](docs/pages/reference/machine-id/v16-upgrade-guide.mdx) for
more details.

#### Default keyboard shortcuts in Teleport Connect have been changed

On Windows and Linux, some of the default shortcuts conflicted with the default bash or nano shortcuts 
(e.g. Ctrl + E, Ctrl + K).
On those platforms, the default shortcuts have been changed to a combination of Ctrl + Shift + *.
We also updated the shortcut to open a new terminal on macOS to Control + Shift + \`.  
See [configuration](docs/pages/connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx#configuration)
for the current list of shortcuts.

## 15.0.0 (xx/xx/24)

### New features

#### FIPS now supported on ARM64

Teleport 15 now provides FIPS-compliant Linux builds on ARM64. Users will now
be able to run Teleport in FedRAMP/FIPS mode on ARM64.

#### Hardened AMIs now produced for ARM64

Teleport 15 now provides hardened AWS AMIs on ARM64.

#### Streaming session playback

Prior to Teleport 15, `tsh play` and the web UI would download the entire
session recording before starting playback. As a result, playback of large
recordings could be slow to start, and may fail to play at all in the browser.

In Teleport 15, session recordings are streamed from the Auth Service, allowing
playback to start before the entire session is downloaded and unpacked.

Additionally, `tsh play` now supports a `--speed` flag for adjusting the
playback speed.

#### Standalone Teleport Operator

Prior to Teleport 15, the Teleport Kubernetes Operator had to run as a sidecar
of the Teleport auth. It was not possible to use the operator in Teleport
Enterprise (Cloud) or against a Teleport cluster not deployed with the
`teleport-cluster` Helm chart.

In Teleport 15, the Teleport Operator can reconcile resources in any Teleport
cluster. Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) users can now use the operator to manage
their resources.

When deployed with the `teleport-cluster` chart, the operator now runs in a
separate pod. This ensures that Teleport's availability won't be impacted if
the operator becomes unready.

See [the Standalone Operator guide](docs/pages/admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/teleport-operator/teleport-operator-standalone.mdx)
for installation instructions.

#### Teleport Operator now supports roles v6 and v7

Starting with Teleport 15, newly supported kinds will contain the resource version.
For example: `TeleportRoleV6` and `TeleportRoleV7` kinds will allow users to
create Teleport Roles v6 and v7.

Existing kinds will remain unchanged in Teleport 15, but will be renamed in
Teleport 16 for consistency.

To migrate an existing Custom Resource (CR) `TeleportRole` to
a `TeleportRoleV7`, you must:
- upgrade Teleport and the operator to v15
- annotate the exiting `TeleportRole` CR with `teleport.dev/keep: "true"`
- delete the `TeleportRole` CR (it won't delete the role in Teleport thanks to the annotation)
- create a new `TeleportRoleV7` CR with the same name

### Breaking changes and deprecations

#### RDP engine requires RemoteFX

Teleport 15 includes a new RDP engine that leverages the RemoteFX codec for
improved performance. Additional configuration may be required to enable
RemoteFX on your Windows hosts.

If you are using our authentication package for local users, the v15 installer
will automatically enable RemoteFX for you.

Alternatively, you can enable RemoteFX by updating the registry:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services' -Name 'ColorDepth' -Type DWORD -Value 5
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services' -Name 'fEnableVirtualizedGraphics' -Type DWORD -Value 1
```

If you are using Teleport with Windows hosts that are part of an Active
Directory environment, you should enable RemoteFX via group policy.

Under Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components >
Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host, enable:

1. Remote Session Environment > RemoteFX for Windows Server 2008 R2 > Configure RemoteFX
1. Remote Session Environment > Enable RemoteFX encoding for RemoteFX clients designed for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
1. Remote Session Environment > Limit maximum color depth

Detailed instructions are available in the
[setup guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/active-directory.mdx#enable-remotefx).
A reboot may be required for these changes to take effect.

#### `tsh ssh`

When running a command on multiple nodes with `tsh ssh`, each line of output
is now labeled with the hostname of the node it was written by. Users that
rely on parsing the output from multiple nodes should pass the `--log-dir` flag
to `tsh ssh`, which will create a directory where the separated output of each node
will be written.

#### `drop` host user creation mode

The `drop` host user creation mode has been removed in Teleport 15. It is replaced
by `insecure-drop`, which still creates temporary users but does not create a
home directory. Users who need home directory creation should either wrap `useradd`/`userdel`
or use PAM.

#### Remove restricted sessions for SSH

The restricted session feature for SSH has been deprecated since Teleport 14 and 
has been removed in Teleport 15. We recommend implementing network restrictions 
outside of Teleport (iptables, security groups, etc).

#### Packages no longer published to legacy Debian and RPM repos

`deb.releases.teleport.dev` and `rpm.releases.teleport.dev` were deprecated in
Teleport 11. Beginning in Teleport 15, Debian and RPM packages will no longer be
published to these repos. Teleport 14 and prior packages will continue to be
published to these repos for the remainder of those releases' lifecycle.

All users are recommended to switch to `apt.releases.teleport.dev` and
`yum.releases.teleport.dev` repositories as described in installation
[instructions](docs/pages/installation.mdx).

The legacy package repos will be shut off in mid 2025 after Teleport 14
has been out of support for many months.

#### Container images

Teleport 15 contains several breaking changes to improve the default security
and usability of Teleport-provided container images.

##### "Heavy" container images are discontinued

In order to increase default security in 15+, Teleport will no longer publish
[container images containing a shell and command line environment](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/branch/v14/build.assets/charts/Dockerfile)
to Elastic Container Registry's [gravitational/teleport](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport)
image repo. Instead, all users should use the [distroless images](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/branch/v15/build.assets/charts/Dockerfile-distroless)
introduced in Teleport 12. These images can be found at:

* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless
* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-distroless

For users who need a shell in a Teleport container, a "debug" image is
available which contains BusyBox, including a shell and many CLI tools. Find
the debug images at:

* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug
* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-distroless-debug

Do not run debug container images in production environments.

Heavy container images will continue to be published for Teleport 13 and 14
throughout the remainder of these releases' lifecycle.

##### Helm cluster chart FIPS mode changes

The teleport-cluster chart no longer uses versionOverride and extraArgs to set FIPS mode. 

Instead, you should use the following values file configuration:
```
enterpriseImage: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-fips-distroless
authentication:
  localAuth: false
```

##### Multi-architecture Teleport Operator images

Teleport Operator container images will no longer be published with architecture
suffixes in their tags (for example: `14.2.1-amd64` and `14.2.1-arm`). Instead,
only a single tag will be published with multi-platform support (e.g., `15.0.0`).
If you use Teleport Operator images with an architecture suffix, remove the
suffix and your client should automatically pull the platform-appropriate image.
Individual architectures may be pulled with `docker pull --platform <arch>`.

##### Quay.io registry

The quay.io container registry was deprecated and Teleport 12 is the last
version to publish images to quay.io. With Teleport 15's release, v12 is no
longer supported and no new container images will be published to quay.io.

For Teleport 8+, replacement container images can be found in [Teleport's public ECR registry](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational).

Users who wish to continue to use unsupported container images prior to
Teleport 8 will need to download any quay.io images they depend on and mirror
them elsewhere before July 2024. Following brownouts in May and June, Teleport
will disable pulls from all Teleport quay.io repositories on Wednesday July 3,
2024.

#### Amazon AMIs

Teleport 15 contains several breaking changes to improve the default security
and usability of Teleport-provided Amazon AMIs.

##### Hardened AMIs

Teleport-provided Amazon Linux 2023 previously only supported x86_64/amd64.
Starting with Teleport 15, arm64-based AMIs will be produced. However, the
naming scheme for these AMIs has been changed to include the architecture.

- Previous naming scheme: `teleport-oss-14.0.0-$TIMESTAMP`
- New naming scheme: `teleport-oss-15.0.0-x86_64-$TIMESTAMP`

##### Legacy Amazon Linux 2 AMIs

Teleport-provided Amazon Linux 2 AMIs were deprecated, and Teleport 14 is the
last version to produce such legacy AMIs. With Teleport 15's release, only
the newer hardened Amazon Linux 2023 AMIs will be produced.

The legacy AMIs will continue to be published for Teleport 13 and 14 throughout
the remainder of these releases' lifecycle.

#### `windows_desktop_service` no longer writes to the NTAuth store

In Teleport 15, the process that periodically publishes Teleport's user CA to
the Windows NTAuth store has been removed. It is not necessary for Teleport to
perform this step since it must be done by an administrator at installation
time. As a result, Teleport's service account can use more restrictive
permissions.

#### Example AWS cluster deployments updated

The AWS terraform examples for Teleport clusters have been updated to use the
newer hardened Amazon Linux 2023 AMIs. Additionally, the default architecture
and instance type has been changed to ARM64/Graviton.

As a result of this modernization, the legacy monitoring stack configuration
used with the legacy AMIs has been removed.

#### `teleport-cluster` Helm chart changes

Due to the new separate operator deployment, the operator is deployed by a subchart.
This causes the following breaking changes:
- `installCRDs` has been replaced by `operator.installCRDs`
- `teleportVersionOverride` does not set the operator version anymore, you must 
  use `operator.teleportVersionOverride` to override the operator version.

Note: version overrides are dangerous and not recommended. Each chart version
is designed to run a specific Teleport and operator version. If you want to
deploy a specific Teleport version, use Helm's `--version X.Y.Z` instead.

The operator now joins using a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token. To validate the
token, the Teleport Auth Service must have access to the `TokenReview` API.
The chart configures this for you since v12, unless you disabled `rbac` creation.

##### Helm cluster chart FIPS mode changes

The teleport-cluster chart no longer uses versionOverride and extraArgs to set FIPS mode. 

Instead, you should use the following values file configuration:

```
enterpriseImage: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-fips-distroless
authentication:
  localAuth: false

```

#### Resource version is now mandatory and immutable in the Terraform provider

Starting with Teleport 15, each Terraform resource must have its version specified.
Before version 15, Terraform was picking the latest version available on resource creation.
This caused inconsistencies as new resources created with the same manifest as
old resources were not exhibiting the same behavior.

Resource version is now immutable. Changing a resource version will cause
Terraform to delete and re-create the resource. This ensures the correct
defaults are set.

Existing resources will continue to work as Terraform already imported their
version. However, new resources will require an explicit version.

### Other changes

#### Increased password length

The minimum password length has been increased to 12 characters.

#### Increased account lockout interval

The account lockout interval has been increased to 30 minutes.

## 14.0.0 (09/20/23)

Teleport 14 brings the following new major features and improvements:

- Access lists
- Unified resource view
- ClickHouse support for database access
- Advanced audit log
- Kubernetes apps auto-discovery
- Extended Kubernetes per-resource RBAC
- Oracle database access audit logging support
- Enhanced PuTTY support
- Support for TLS routing in Terraform deployment examples
- Discord and ServiceNow hosted plugins
- Limited passwordless access for local Windows users in Teleport Community
  Edition 
- Machine ID: Kubernetes Secret destination

In addition, this release includes several changes that affect existing
functionality listed in the “Breaking changes” section below. Users are advised
to review them before upgrading.

### New features

#### Advanced audit log

Teleport 14 includes support for a new audit log powered by Amazon S3 and Athena
that supports efficient searching, sorting, and filtering operations. Teleport
Enterprise (Cloud) customers will have their audit log automatically migrated to
this new backend.

See the documentation [here](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx#athena).

#### Access lists

Teleport 14 introduces foundational support for Access Lists, an extension to
the short-lived Access Request system targeted towards longer-term access.
Administrators can add users to Access Lists granting them long-term permissions
within the cluster.

As the feature is being developed, future Teleport releases will add support for
periodic audit reviews and deeper integration of Access Lists with Okta.

You can find existing Access Lists documentation [here](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-lists/guide.mdx).

#### Unified resources view

The web UI in Teleport 14 has been updated to show all resources in a single
unified view.

This is the first step in a series of changes designed to support a
customizable Teleport experience and make it easier to access the resources that
are most important to you.

#### Kubernetes apps auto-discovery

Teleport 14 updates its auto-discovery capabilities with support for web
applications in Kubernetes clusters. When connected to a Kubernetes cluster (or
deployed as a Helm chart), the Teleport Discovery Service will automatically find
and enroll web applications with your Teleport cluster.

See documentation [here](docs/pages/enroll-resources/auto-discovery/kubernetes-applications.mdx).

#### Extended Kubernetes per-resource RBAC

Teleport 14 extends resource-based Access Requests to support more Kubernetes
resources than just pods, including custom resources, and verbs. Note that this
feature requires role version `v7`.

See Kubernetes resources documentation to see a full list of [supported
resources](docs/pages/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx#kubernetes_resources).

#### ClickHouse support for database access

Teleport 14 adds database access support for ClickHouse HTTP and native (TCP)
protocols. When using HTTP protocol, the user's query activity is captured in
the Teleport audit log.

See how to connect ClickHouse to Teleport
[here](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/clickhouse-self-hosted.mdx).

#### Oracle database access audit logging support

In Teleport 14, database access for Oracle integration is updated with query
audit logging support.

See documentation on how to configure it in the [Oracle guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/oracle-self-hosted.mdx).

#### Limited passwordless access for local Windows users in Teleport Community Edition 

In Teleport 14, access to Windows desktops with local Windows users has been
extended to Community Edition. Teleport will permit users to register and
connect to up to 5 desktops with local users without an enterprise license.

For more information on using Teleport with local Windows users, see [docs](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx).

#### Discord and ServiceNow hosted plugins

Teleport 14 includes support for hosted Discord and ServiceNow plugins. Teleport
Enterprise (Cloud) users can configure Discord and ServiceNow integrations to
receive Access Request notifications.

Discord plugin is available now, ServiceNow is coming in 14.0.1.

#### Enhanced PuTTY Support

tsh on Windows now supports the `tsh puttyconfig` command, which can
configure saved sessions inside the well-known PuTTY client to connect to
Teleport-protected servers.

For more information, see [docs](docs/pages/connect-your-client/putty-winscp.mdx).

#### Support for TLS routing in Terraform deployment examples

The ha-autoscale-cluster and starter-cluster Terraform deployment examples now
support a `USE_TLS_ROUTING` variable to enable TLS routing inside the deployed
Teleport cluster.

#### Machine ID: Kubernetes Secret destination

In Teleport 14, `tbot` can now be configured to write artifacts such as
credentials and configuration files directly to a Kubernetes secret rather than
a directory on the local file system.

For more information, see [docs](docs/pages/reference/machine-id/configuration.mdx).

### Breaking changes and deprecations

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 14 before upgrading.

#### SSH node open dial no longer supported

Teleport 14 no longer allows connecting to OpenSSH servers not registered with
the cluster. Follow the updated agentless OpenSSH integration [guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh-agentless.mdx)
to register your OpenSSH nodes in the cluster’s inventory.

You can set `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_UNLISTED_AGENT_DIALING=yes` environment variable
on Teleport proxy to temporarily re-enable the open dial functionality. The
environment variable will be removed in Teleport 15.

#### Proxy protocol default change

Starting from version 14, Teleport will require users to explicitly enable or
disable PROXY protocol in their `proxy_service`/`auth_service` configuration
using `proxy_protocol: on|off` option.

Users who run their proxies behind L4 load balancers with PROXY protocol
enabled, should set `proxy_protocol: on`.  Users who don’t run Teleport behind
PROXY protocol enabled load balancers, should disable `proxy_protocol: off`
explicitly for security reasons.

By default, Teleport will accept the PROXY line but will prevent connections
with IP pinning enabled. IP pinning users will need to explicitly enable/disable
proxy protocol like explained above.

See more details in our [documentation](docs/pages/admin-guides/management/security/proxy-protocol.mdx).

#### Legacy deb/rpm package repositories are deprecated

Teleport 14 will be the last release published to the legacy package
repositories at `deb.releases.teleport.dev` and `rpm.releases.teleport.dev`.
Starting with Teleport 15, packages will only be published to the new
repositories at `apt.releases.teleport.dev` and `yum.releases.teleport.dev`.

All users are recommended to switch to `apt.releases.teleport.dev` and
`yum.releases.teleport.dev` repositories as described in installation
[instructions](docs/pages/installation.mdx).

#### `Cf-Access-Token` header no longer included with requests to Teleport-protected applications

Starting from Teleport 14, the `Cf-Access-Token` header containing the signed
JWT token will no longer be included by default with all requests to
Teleport-protected applications.
All requests will still include `Teleport-JWT-Assertion` containing the JWT
token.

See documentation for details on how to inject the JWT token into any header
using [header rewriting](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/jwt/introduction.mdx#inject-jwt).

#### tsh db CLI commands changes

In Teleport 14 tsh db sub-commands will attempt to select a default value for
`--db-user` or `--db-name` flags if they are not provided by the user by
examining their allowed `db_users` and `db_names`.

The flags `--cert-file` and `--key-file` for tsh proxy db command were also
removed, in favor of the `--tunnel` flag that opens an authenticated local
database proxy.

#### MongoDB versions prior to 3.6 are no longer supported

Teleport 14 includes an update to the MongoDB driver.

Due to the MongoDB team dropping support for servers prior to version 3.6 (which
reached EOL on April 30, 2021), Teleport also will no longer be able to support
these old server versions.

#### Symlinks for `~/.tsh/environment` no longer supported

In order to strengthen the security in Teleport 14, file loading from home
directories where the path includes a symlink is no longer allowed.  The most
common use case for this is loading environment variables from the
`~/.tsh/environment` file.  This will still work normally as long as the path
includes no symlinks.

#### Deprecated audit event

Teleport 14 deprecates the `trusted_cluster_token.create` audit event, replacing
it with a new `join_token.create` event. The new event is emitted when any join
token is created, whether it be for trusted clusters or other Teleport services.

Teleport 14 will emit both events when a trusted cluster join token is created.
Starting in Teleport 15, the `trusted_cluster_token.create` event will no longer
be emitted.

### Other changes

#### DynamoDB billing mode defaults to on-demand

In Teleport 14, when creating new DynamoDB tables, Teleport will now create them
with the billing mode set to `pay_per_request` instead of being set to provisioned
mode.

The old behavior can be restored by setting the `billing_mode` option in the
storage configuration.

#### Default role version is v7

The default role version in Teleport 14 is `v7` which enables support for extended
Kubernetes per-resource RBAC, and changes the `kubernetes_resources` default to
wildcard for better getting started user experience.

You can review role versions in the [documentation](docs/pages/reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).

#### Stricter name validation for auto-discovered databases

In Teleport 14, database discovery via `db_service` config enforces the same name
validation as for databases created via tctl, static config, and
`discovery_service`.

As such, database names in AWS, GCP and Azure must start with a letter, contain
only letters, digits, and hyphens and end with a letter or digit (no trailing
hyphens).

#### Access Request API changes

Teleport 14 introduces a new and more secure API for submitting Access Requests.
As a result, tsh users may be prompted to upgrade their clients before
submitting an Access Request.

#### Desktop discovery name change

Desktops discovered via LDAP will have a short suffix appended to their name to
ensure uniqueness. Users will notice duplicate desktops (with and without the
suffix) for up to an hour after upgrading. Connectivity to desktops will not be
affected, and the old record will naturally expire after 1 hour.

#### Machine ID : New configuration schema

Teleport 14 introduces a new configuration schema (v2) for Machine ID’s agent
`tbot`.  The new schema is designed to be more explicit and more extensible:

```yaml
version: v2
onboarding:
 token: gcp-bot
 join_method: gcp
storage:
 type: memory
auth_server: example.teleport.sh:443
outputs:
 - type: identity
   destination:
     type: kubernetes_secret
     name: my-secret
​
 - type: kubernetes
   kubernetes_cluster: my-cluster
   destination:
     type: directory
     path: ./k8s
​
 - type: database
   service: my-postgres-service
   database: postgres
   username: postgres
   destination:
     type: directory
     path: ./db
​
 - type: application
   app_name: my-app
   destination:
     type: directory
     path: ./app
```

`tbot` will continue to support the v1 schema for several Teleport versions but it
is recommended that you migrate to v2 as soon as possible to benefit from new
Machine ID features.

For more details and guidance on how to upgrade to v2, see [docs](docs/pages/reference/machine-id/v14-upgrade-guide.mdx).

## 13.0.1 (05/xx/23)

* Helm Charts
  * Fixed issue with invite token being incorrectly overridden when it was manually created. [#26055](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/26055)

### Breaking Changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 13 before upgrading.

#### Teleport Kubernetes Agent helm chart

When upgrading to Teleport 13, users of the Teleport Kubernetes Agent Helm chart
that manually create their own Teleport token secret (`secretName=<secretName>` and no auth token provided)
will need to set the following values:

```yaml
# Manages the join token secret creation and its name.
joinTokenSecret:
  # create controls whether the Helm chart should create and manage the join token
  # secret.
  # If false, the chart assumes that the secret with the configured name already exists at the
  # installation namespace.
  create: false
  # Name of the Secret to store the teleport join token.
  name: <secretName>
```

The Helm chart parameter `secretName` was deprecated in Teleport 13 in favor of
`joinTokenSecret.name`. `joinTokenSecret.create` indicates whether the Helm
chart should create and manage the join token secret. If `create` is set to
`false`, the chart assumes that the secret with the configured name already
exists at the installation namespace.

## 13.0.0 (05/08/23)

Teleport 13 brings the following marquee features and improvements:

* (Preview) Automatic agent upgrades.
* (Preview) TLS routing through ALB for accessing servers, Kubernetes clusters, and applications.
* (Preview, Enterprise-only) Ability to import applications and groups from Okta.
* (Preview) Teleport support for AWS OpenSearch.
* (Preview) View and control access to OpenSSH nodes natively in Teleport.
* Cross-cluster search for Teleport Connect.
* Performance improvements for accessing Kubernetes clusters.
* Universal binaries (including Apple Silicon) for macOS.
* Simplified RDS onboarding flow in Access Management UI.
* Light theme for Web UI.

### (Preview) Automatic agent upgrades

In Teleport 13 users can configure their Teleport agents deployed via apt/yum
repositories or a Helm chart to be upgraded automatically.

### (Preview) TLS routing through ALB accessing servers, Kubernetes clusters, and applications

Teleport 13 adds single-port TLS routing mode support for servers, Kubernetes
clusters, and applications for clusters deployed behind application layer load
balancers such as AWS ALB.

### (Preview, Enterprise-only) Ability to import applications and groups from Okta

In Teleport 13  users can import apps and groups from Okta and use Teleport
Access Requests for requesting short-term access to them. This feature is only
available in the Teleport Enterprise edition.

### (Preview) Teleport support for AWS OpenSearch

Teleport users can now connect to AWS OpenSearch databases.

### (Preview) View and control access to OpenSSH nodes natively in Teleport

In Teleport 13 users will be able register OpenSSH nodes as a resource with the
cluster.

This will allow users to view the OpenSSH nodes in Web UI and using `tsh ls`
and use RBAC to control access to them.

See the updated [OpenSSH integration
guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh-agentless.mdx).

### Cross-cluster search for Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect now includes a new search experience, allowing you to search
for and connect to resources across all logged-in clusters.

### Performance improvements for accessing Kubernetes clusters

In Teleport 13 we improved the way the Teleport Proxy Service handles Kubernetes
credentials.

Users will experience better performance when interacting with Kubernetes
clusters using kubectl or via the API.

### Universal binaries (including Apple Silicon) for macOS

Teleport 13 binaries (including Teleport Connect) will have universal
architecture and run natively on both Intel and ARM macOS systems.

### Simplified RDS onboarding flow in Access Management UI

When connecting an RDS database using Teleport 13 Access Management UI, users
can connect their AWS account and select the RDS database to add instead of
entering details manually.

To try out the new flow, add an RDS database using the Resource Management UI
in your cluster’s Web UI dashboard.

### Light theme for Web UI

Teleport's web UI includes an optional light theme.

The light theme is enabled by default but can be changed back to the dark theme
via the top-right corner user settings menu.

### Windows desktop session recording export

Session recordings for Windows desktop sessions can now be exported to video
format for offline playback with the new tsh recordings export command.

### SFTP in Moderated Sessions

Teleport 13 adds the ability to transfer files in Moderated Sessions.
This feature requires that both the session originator and the moderator
have joined the session via the web UI.

### Breaking changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes
in Teleport 13 before upgrading.

#### Default session join mode

Teleport 13 defaults to observer (read-only) mode when joining SSH and Kubernetes
sessions. Prior versions of Teleport would default to peer mode for SSH sessions
and moderator mode for Kubernetes sessions. To override the default join mode,
specify the --mode flag with tsh join.

#### CA rotation deprecation

Teleport 13 removes support for rotating all certificate authorities with
`tctl auth rotate --type=all`. The `type` flag is now required, which ensures
that only one CA is rotated at a time, increasing cluster stability during
rotations.

#### Join token API changes

The default 30-minute expiry no longer applies to tokens created via YAML
resource files. If you want to enforce an expiration, ensure this is set in the
`metadata.expires` field. Tokens created using `tctl nodes add` and `tctl tokens add`
will continue to have a default 30m expiry applied.

Additionally, users of Teleport’s API module will note that the `CreateToken`
and `UpsertToken` RPCs are now deprecated in favor of `CreateTokenV2` and
`UpsertTokenV2`. The new V2 variants no longer have a default expiry, so be sure
to set a TTL if you want your tokens to expire.

The original RPCs are still supported in Teleport 13 and will be removed
completely for Teleport 14.

#### Enhanced user validation

Teleport 13 will refuse to create or update users that reference non-existent
roles. In some circumstances, older versions of Teleport would permit you to
create users and assign them invalid roles. In Teleport 13 this is a hard error.

#### Quay.io registry

Quay.io registry was deprecated in Teleport 11 and starting with Teleport 13,
Teleport container images are no longer being published to it.

Users should use the [public ECR
registry](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational).

#### Helm chart uses `distroless`-based container image by default

Starting with Teleport 13, the Helm charts `teleport-cluster` and `teleport-kube-agent`
are deploying distroless Teleport images by default. Those images are slimmer
and more secure but contain less tooling (e.g. neither `bash` nor
`apt` are available).

The Debian-based images are deprecated and will be removed in Teleport 14.
The chart image can be reverted back to the Debian-based images by setting:
```yaml
image: "public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport"
```

For debugging purposes, a "debug" image is available and contains BusyBox,
which includes a shell and most common POSIX executables:
`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug`.

## 12.1.5 (03/30/23)

This release of Teleport contains 2 security fixes as well as multiple improvements and bug fixes.

### [High] OS authorization bypass in SSH tunneling

When establishing an SSH port forwarding connection, Teleport did not
sufficiently validate the specified OS principal.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid cluster credentials to
establish a TCP tunnel to a node using a non-existent Linux user.

The connection attempt would show up in the audit log as a "port" audit event
(code T3003I) and include Teleport username in the "user" field.

### [High] Teleport authorization bypass in Kubernetes cluster access

When authorizing a request to a Teleport-protected Kubernetes cluster, Teleport
did not adequately validate the target Kubernetes cluster.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid Kubernetes agent credentials
or a join token to trick Teleport into forwarding requests to a different
Kubernetes cluster.

Every Kubernetes request would show up in the audit log as a "kube.request"
audit event (code T3009I) and include the Kubernetes cluster metadata.

## 12.0.1

Teleport 12 brings the following marquee features and improvements:

- Device Trust (Preview, Enterprise only)
- Passwordless Windows access for local users (Preview, Enterprise only)
- Per-pod RBAC for Kubernetes access (Preview)
- Azure and GCP CLI support for application access (Preview)
- Support for more databases in database access:
  - Amazon DynamoDB
  - Amazon Redshift Serverless
  - AWS RDS Proxy for PostgreSQL/MySQL
  - Azure SQLServer Auto Discovery
  - Azure Flexible Servers
- Refactored Helm charts (Preview)
- Dropped support for SHA1 in server access
- Signed/notarized macOS binaries

### Device Trust (Preview, Enterprise only)

Teleport 12 includes a preview of our upcoming Device Trust feature, which
allows administrators to require that Teleport access is performed from an
authenticated and trusted device.

This preview release requires macOS and a native client like tsh or Teleport
Connect. These clients leverage the Secure Enclave on macOS to solve device
challenges issued by the Teleport CA, proving their identity as a trusted
device.

Teleport features requiring the web UI (desktop access, application access) are
not currently supported.

### Passwordless Windows Access for Local Users (Preview, Enterprise only)

Teleport 12 brings passwordless certificate-based authentication to Windows
desktops in environments where Active Directory is not available. This feature
requires the installation of a Teleport package on each Windows desktop.

### Per-pod RBAC for Kubernetes access (Preview)

Teleport 12 extends RBAC to support controlling access to individual pods in
Kubernetes clusters. Pod RBAC integrates with existing Teleport RBAC features
such as role templating and Access Requests.

### Azure and GCP CLI support for application access (Preview)

In Teleport 12 administrators can interact with Azure and GCP APIs through the
Application Service using `tsh az` and `tsh gcloud` CLI commands, or using
standard `az` and `gcloud` tools through the local application proxy.

### Support for more databases in database access

Database access in Teleport 12 brings a number of new integrations to AWS-hosted
databases such as DynamoDB (now with audit log support), Redshift Serverless and
RDS Proxy for PostgreSQL/MySQL.

On Azure, database access adds SQLServer auto-discovery and support for Azure
Flexible Server for PostgreSQL/MySQL.

### Refactored Helm charts (Preview)

The “teleport-cluster” Helm chart underwent significant refactoring in Teleport
12 to provide better scalability and UX. Proxy and Auth are now separate
deployments and the new “scratch” chart mode makes it easier to provide a custom
Teleport config.

“Custom” mode users should follow the [migration
guide](docs/pages/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/migration-v12.mdx).

### Dropped support for SHA1 in Teleport-protected servers

Newer OpenSSH clients connecting to Teleport 12 clusters no longer need the
“PubAcceptedKeyTypes” workaround to include the deprecated “sha” algorithm.

### Signed/notarized macOS binaries

Users who download Teleport 12 Darwin binaries would no longer get an untrusted
software warning from macOS.

### tctl edit

tctl now supports an edit subcommand, allowing you to edit resources directly in
your preferred text editor.

### Breaking Changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 12 before upgrading.

#### Helm charts

The teleport-cluster Helm chart underwent significant changes in Teleport 12. To
upgrade from an older version of the Helm chart deployed in “custom” mode,
follow
the [migration guide](docs/pages/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/migration-v12.mdx).

Additionally, PSPs are removed from the chart when installing on Kubernetes 1.23
and higher to account for the deprecation/removal of PSPs by Kubernetes.

#### tctl auth export

The tctl auth export command only exports the private key when passing the
--keys flag. Previously it would output the certificate and private key
together.

#### Desktop access

Windows Desktop sessions disable the wallpaper by default, improving
performance. To restore the previous behavior, add `show_desktop_wallpaper: true`
to your windows_desktop_service config.

### Secure certificate mapping for desktop access

Later this year, Windows will begin requiring a stronger mapping from a certificate
to an Active Directory user. In anticipation of this change, Teleport 11.2.0 is compliant
with the new requirements.

*Warning:* This feature requires that Teleport's own service account also uses a strong
mapping. In order to support this requirement, you must now set a new Security Identifier
(`sid`) field in the LDAP configuration for your Windows Desktop Services. You can find
the SID for your service account by running the following PowerShell snippet
(replace `svc-teleport` with the name of the service account you are using):

```
Get-AdUser -Identity svc-teleport | Select SID
```

## 11.1.4

This release of Teleport contains multiple security fixes, improvements and bug fixes.

*Note:* This release of Teleport contains an issue that affects backwards compatibility
with database access agents. If you are a database access user we recommend skipping
straight to version 11.2.0.

### [Critical] RBAC bypass in SSH TCP tunneling

When establishing a direct-tcpip channel, Teleport did not sufficiently validate
RBAC.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid cluster credentials to
establish a TCP tunnel to a node they didn’t have access to.

The connection attempt would show up in the audit log as a “port” audit event
(code T3003I) and include Teleport username in the “user” field.

### [High] Application access session hijack

When accepting application Access Requests, Teleport did not sufficiently
validate client credentials.

This could allow an attacker in possession of a valid active application session
ID to issue requests to this application impersonating the session owner for a
limited time window.

Presence of multiple “cert.create” audit events (code TC000I) with the same app
session ID in the “route_to_app.session_id” field may indicate the attempt to
impersonate an existing user’s application session.

### [Medium] SSH IP pinning bypass

When issuing a user certificate, Teleport did not check for the presence of IP
restrictions in the client’s credentials.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid client credentials with IP
restrictions to reissue credentials without IP restrictions.

Presence of a “cert.create” audit event (code TC000I) without corresponding
“user.login” audit event (codes T1000I or T1101I) for users with IP restricted
roles may indicate an issuance of a certificate without IP restrictions.

### [Low] Web API session caching

After logging out via the web UI, a user’s session could remain cached in
Teleport’s proxy, allowing continued access to resources for a limited time
window.

### Other improvements and bugfixes

* Fixed issue with noisy-square distortions in desktop access. [#19545](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/19545)

## 11.0.0

Teleport 11 brings the following new major features and improvements:

- Hardware-backed private keys support for server access (Enterprise only).
- Replacement of obsolete SCP protocol with SFTP for server access.
- Removal of persistent storage requirement for Helm charts.
- Automatic discovery and enrollment of EKS/AKS clusters for Kubernetes access.
- Richer Azure integrations for server and database access.
- Cassandra and Scylla support for database access, including Amazon Keyspaces.
- GitHub Actions and Terraform support for Machine ID.
- Access Requests and file upload/download support for Teleport Connect.

### Hardware-backed private keys (Enterprise Only)

Teleport 11 clients (such as tsh or Connect) support storing their private key
material on Yubikey devices instead of filesystem which helps prevent
credentials exfiltration attacks.

See how to enable it in the
[documentation](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/guides/hardware-key-support.mdx):

Hardware-backed private keys is an enterprise only feature, and is currently
supported for server access only.

### SFTP protocol

Teleport 11 adds server-side support for SFTP protocol which many IDEs such as
VSCode or JetBrains PyCharm, GoLand and others use for browsing, copying, and
editing files on remote systems.

The following guides explain how to use IDEs to connect to a remote machine via
Teleport:

- [VS Code](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/guides/vscode.mdx)
- [JetBrains](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/guides/jetbrains-sftp.mdx)

In addition, Teleport 11 clients will use SFTP protocol for file transfer under
the hood instead of the obsolete scp protocol. Server-side scp is still
supported so existing clients aren’t affected.

### Helm charts persistent storage

In Teleport 11 users no longer need to use persistent storage when deploying
Helm charts. When running on Kubernetes, Teleport services will now store their
identities in Kubernetes Secrets which removes the need for using persistent
storage or static join tokens.

For existing deployments, this change involves migration from Deployment to
StatefulSet which is performed automatically during Helm upgrade to Teleport 11.

### EKS/AKS discovery

Teleport 11 adds support for automatic discovery and enrollment of AWS Elastic
Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

### Azure integrations

Teleport 11 improves Azure support in multiple areas.

Teleport agents running on Azure VMs will now automatically import Azure tags to
label resources.

Teleport database access now supports auto-discovery for Azure-hosted PostgreSQL
and MySQL databases. See the [Azure
guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-azure-databases/azure-postgres-mysql.mdx) for more
details.

In addition, Teleport database access will now use Azure AD managed identity
authentication for Azure-hosted SQL Server databases.

### Cassandra/ScyllaDB

Teleport 11 adds support for Cassandra and ScyllaDB databases in Database
Access. This includes support for Amazon Keyspaces.

### Machine ID

Teleport 11 adds support for secret-less joining of Machine ID agents in GitHub
Actions workflows. See the guide for more details: TODO

We have also released a GitHub Action for setting up the Teleport binaries
within a GitHub workflow environment. More details regarding this can be found
at the Teleport GitHub Actions repository:

https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-actions

In addition, the Teleport Terraform plugin now supports the creation of Machine
ID Bots and Bot Tokens.

### tsh MFA on Windows

tsh 11 adds support for MFA and passwordless logins via Windows Hello and
FIDO2 devices.

### Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect has added support for Access Requests and file upload/download.

### Breaking Changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 11 before upgrading.

#### Removed Github external SSO

Beginning in Teleport 11, GitHub SAML SSO will only be available in our
Enterprise Edition. GitHub SSO without SAML will continue to work with OSS
Teleport.

To keep using GitHub SSO with Teleport Community Edition, SAML SSO needs to be disabled
for your GitHub organization. Teleport Community Edition users can continue to use GitHub SSO
if using a Github Free or Team GitHub Plan.

#### Changed Terraform OIDC connector redirect_url type to array

In Teleport Plugins 11, `redirect_url` property in OIDC connectors created via
a Terraform module expects an array:

```
redirect_url = [ "http://example.com" ]
```

#### Deprecated Quay.io registry

Starting with Teleport 11, Quay.io as a container registry has been deprecated.
Customers should use the new AWS ECR registry to pull [Teleport Docker
images](./docs/pages/installation.mdx#docker).

Quay.io registry support will be removed in a future release.

#### Deprecated old deb/rpm repositories

In Teleport 11, old deb/rpm repositories (deb.releases.teleport.dev and
rpm.releases.teleport.dev) have been deprecated. Customers should use the new
repositories (apt.releases.teleport.dev and yum.releases.teleport.dev) to
[install Teleport](docs/pages/installation.mdx#linux).

Support for our old deb/rpm repositories will be removed in a future release.

#### Changed teleport-kube-agent Helm chart to StatefulSet

Teleport 11 agents will now store their identities in Kubernetes Secrets when
deployed via a Helm chart which eliminates the need for using persistent storage
or static join tokens. Due to this change, Teleport agents are now always
deployed as part of StatefulSet regardless of whether persistent storage is
enabled or not.

Existing agents that were deployed as Kubernetes Deployments (i.e. without
persistent storage) will be automatically converted to StatefulSets during
Teleport 11 Helm upgrade.

#### Removed PostgreSQL backend

The preview PostgreSQL backend was deleted due to performance and scalability
concerns.

#### Removed desktop access support for 32-bit ARM and 386 architectures

32-bit support for desktop access on ARM and 386 architectures has been removed
due to performance issues on these devices.

This also reduces the binary size for these builds, making them slightly more
convenient for smaller resource-constrained devices.

## 10.0.0

Teleport 10 is a major release that brings the following new features.

Platform:

* Passwordless (Preview)
* Resource Access Requests (Preview)
* Proxy Peering (Preview)

Server access:

* IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)
* Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)

Database access:

* Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server database access
* Snowflake database access (Preview)
* ElastiCache/MemoryDB database access (Preview)

Teleport Connect:

* Teleport Connect for server and database access (Preview)

Machine ID:

* Machine ID database access support (Preview)

### Passwordless (Preview)

Teleport 10 introduces passwordless support to your clusters. To use passwordless
users may register a security key with resident credentials or use a built-in
authenticator, like Touch ID.

See the [documentation](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx).

### Resource Access Requests (Preview)

Teleport 10 expands just-in-time Access Requests to allow for requesting access
to specific resources. This lets you grant users the least privileged access
needed for their workflows.

Just-in-time Access Requests are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### Proxy Peering (Preview)

Proxy peering enables Teleport deployments to scale without an increase in load
from the number of agent connections. This is accomplished by allowing Proxy
Services to tunnel client connections to the desired agent through a neighboring
proxy and decoupling the number of agent connections from the number of Proxies.

Proxy peering can be enabled with the following configurations:

```yaml
auth_service:
  tunnel_strategy:
    type: proxy_peering
    agent_connection_count: 1
```

```yaml
proxy_service:
  peer_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3021
```

Network connectivity between proxy servers to the `peer_listen_addr` is required
for this feature to work.

Proxy peering is only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)

Teleport 10 introduces a new role option to pin the source IP in SSH
certificates. When enabled, the source IP that was used to request certificates
is embedded in the certificate, and SSH servers will reject connection attempts
from other IPs. This protects against attacks where valid credentials are
exfiltrated from disk and copied out into other environments.

IP-based restrictions are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)

Teleport 10 can be configured to automatically create Linux host users upon
login without having to use Teleport's PAM integration. Users can be added to specific
Linux groups and assigned appropriate “sudoer” privileges.

To learn more about configuring automatic user provisioning read the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/guides/host-user-creation.mdx).

### Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server database access

Teleport 9 introduced a preview of database access support for Microsoft SQL
Server which didn’t include audit logging of user queries. Teleport 10 captures
users' queries and prepared statements and sends them to the audit log, similarly
to other supported database protocols.

Teleport database access for SQL Server remains in Preview mode with more UX
improvements coming in future releases.

Refer to [the guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/sql-server-ad.mdx) to set
up access to a SQL Server with Active Directory authentication.

### Snowflake database access (Preview)

Teleport 10 brings support for Snowflake to database access. Administrators can
set up access to Snowflake databases through Teleport for their users with
standard database access features like role-based access control and audit
logging, including query activity.

Connect your Snowflake database to Teleport following the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-managed-databases/snowflake.mdx).

### Elasticache/MemoryDB database access (Preview)

Teleport 9 added Redis protocol support to database access. Teleport 10 improves
this integration by adding native support for AWS-hosted Elasticache and
MemoryDB, including auto-discovery and automatic credential management in some
deployment configurations.

Learn more about it in the [documentation](
docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/redis-aws.mdx).

### Teleport Connect for server and database access (Preview)

Teleport Connect is a graphical macOS application that simplifies access to your
Teleport resources. Teleport Connect 10 supports server access and database access.
Other protocols and Windows support are coming in a future release.

Get Teleport Connect installer from the macOS tab on the downloads page:
https://goteleport.com/download/.

### Machine ID database access support (Preview)

In Teleport 10 we’ve added database access support to Machine ID. Applications
can use Machine ID to access databases protected by Teleport.

You can find Machine ID guide for database access in the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/machine-id/access-guides/databases.mdx).

### Breaking changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 10 before upgrading.

#### Auth Service version check

Teleport 10 agents will now refuse to start if they detect that the Auth Service
is more than one major version behind them. You can use the `--skip-version-check` flag to
bypass the version check.

Take a look at component compatibility guarantees in the
[documentation](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

#### HTTP_PROXY for reverse tunnels

Reverse tunnel connections will now respect `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables.
This may result in reverse tunnel agents not being able to re-establish
connections if the HTTP proxy is set in their environment and does not allow
connections to the Teleport Proxy Service.

Refer to the
[documentation](docs/pages/reference/networking.mdx#http-connect-proxies)
for more details.

#### New APT repos

With Teleport 10 we’ve migrated to new APT repositories that now support
multiple release channels, Teleport versions and OS distributions. The new
repositories have been backfilled with Teleport versions starting from 6.2.31
and we recommend upgrading to them. The old repositories will be maintained for
the foreseeable future.

See the [installation
instructions](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/getting-started.mdx#step-14-install-teleport-on-your-linux-host).

#### Removed “tctl access ls”

The `tctl access ls` command that returned information about user server access
within the cluster was removed. Please use a previous `tctl` version if you’d like
to keep using it.

#### Relaxed session join permissions

In previous versions of Teleport users needed full access to a Node/Kubernetes
pod in order to join a session. Teleport 10 relaxes this requirement. Joining
sessions remains deny-by-default but now only `join_sessions` statements are
checked for session join RBAC.

See the [Moderated Sessions
guide](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx) for more
details.

#### GitHub connectors

The GitHub authentication connector’s `teams_to_logins` field is deprecated in favor of the new
`teams_to_roles` field. The old field will be removed in a future release.

#### Teleport FIPS AWS endpoints

Teleport 10 will now automatically use FIPS endpoints for AWS S3 and DynamoDB
when started with the `--fips` flag. You can use the `use_fips_endpoint=false`
connection endpoint option to use regular endpoints for Teleport in FIPS mode,
for example:

```
s3://bucket/path?region=us-east-1&use_fips_endpoint=false
```

See the [S3/DynamoDB backend
documentation](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx) for more information.

## 9.3.9

This release of Teleport contains a security fix, as well as multiple improvements and bug fixes.

### Auth bypass in Moderated Sessions

## 9.3.4

This release of Teleport contains multiple security, bug fixes and improvements.

### Escalation attack in agent forwarding

When setting up agent forwarding on the node, Teleport did not handle unix socket creation in a secure manner.

This could have given a potential attacker an opportunity to get Teleport to change arbitrary file permissions to the attacker’s user.

### WebSockets CSRF

When handling websocket requests, Teleport did not verify that the provided Bearer token was generated for the correct user.

This could have allowed a malicious low privileged Teleport user to use a social engineering attack to gain higher privileged access on the same Teleport cluster.

### Denial of service in Access Requests

When accepting an Access Request, Teleport did not enforce the maximum request reason size.

This could allow a malicious actor to mount a DoS attack by creating an Access Request with a very large request reason.

### Auth bypass in moderated sessions

When initializing a moderated session, Teleport did not discard participant’s input prior to the moderator joining.

This could prevent a moderator from being able to interrupt a malicious command executed by a participant.

### Other fixes

* Fixed issue with stdin hijacking when per-session MFA is enabled. [#13212](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13212)

### Breaking Changes

Teleport 9.3.0 reduces the minimum GLIBC requirement to 2.18 and enforces more
secure cipher suites for desktop access.

As a result of these changes, desktop access users with desktops running Windows
Server 2012R2 will need to perform [additional
configuration](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx) to force Windows
to use compatible cipher suites.

Windows desktops running Windows Server 2016 and newer will continue to operate
normally - no additional configuration is required.

## 9.0.0

Teleport 9.0 is a major release that brings:

- Teleport desktop access GA
- Teleport Machine ID Preview
- Various additions to Teleport database access
- Moderated Sessions for server and Kubernetes access

Desktop access adds support for clipboard sharing, session recording, and
per-session MFA.

Teleport Machine ID Preview extends identity-based access to machines. It's the
easiest way to issue, renew, and manage SSH and X.509 certificates for service
accounts, microservices, CI/CD automation and all other forms of
machine-to-machine access.

Database access brings self-hosted Redis support, RDS MariaDB (10.6 and higher)
support, auto-discovery for Redshift clusters, and auto-IAM configuration
improvements to GA. Additionally, this release also brings Microsoft SQL Server
with AD authentication to Preview.

Moderated Sessions enables the creation of sessions where a moderator has to
be present. This feature can be selectively enabled for specific sessions via
RBAC and can be used in conjunction with per-session MFA.

### Desktop access

#### Clipboard Support

Desktop access now supports copying and pasting text between your local
workstation and a remote Windows Desktop. This feature requires a Chromium-based
browser and can be disabled via RBAC.

#### Session Recording

Desktop sessions are now recorded and stored alongside SSH sessions, and can be
viewed in Teleport's web interface. Desktop session recordings are fully
compatible with the RBAC for sessions feature introduced in Teleport 8.1.

#### Per-session MFA

Per-session MFA settings now apply to desktop sessions. This allows cluster
administrators to require an additional MFA "tap" prior to opening a desktop
session. This feature requires a WebAuthn device.

### Machine ID (Preview)

Machine ID allows the creation of machine / bot / service account users who can
automatically issue, renew, and manage SSH and X.509 certificates to facilitate
machine-to-machine access.

Machine ID is a service that programmatically issues and renews short-lived
certificates to any service account (e.g., a CI/CD server) by retrieving
credentials from the Teleport Auth Service. This enables fine-grained role-based
access controls and audit.

Some of the things you can do with Machine ID:

- Machines can retrieve short-lived SSH certificates for CI/CD pipelines.
- Machines can retrieve short-lived X.509 certificates for use with databases or
  applications.
- Configure role-based access controls and locking for machines.
- Capture access events in the audit log.

[Machine ID getting started guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/machine-id/getting-started.mdx)

### Database access

#### Redis

You can now use database access to connect to a self-hosted Redis instance or
Redis cluster and view Redis commands in the Teleport audit log. We will be
adding support for Amazon Elasticache in the coming weeks.

[Self-hosted Redis
guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/redis.mdx)

#### SQL Server (Preview)

Teleport 9 includes a preview release of Microsoft SQL Server with Active
Directory authentication support for database access. Audit logging of query
activity is not included in the preview release and will be implemented in a
later 9.x release.

[SQL Server guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/sql-server-ad.mdx)

#### RDS MariaDB

Teleport 9 updates MariaDB support with auto-discovery and connection to AWS RDS
MariaDB databases using IAM authentication. The minimum MariaDB version that
supports IAM authentication is 10.6.

[Updated RDS guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx)

#### Other Improvements

In addition, Teleport 9 expands auto-discovery to support Redshift databases and
2 new commands which simplify the database access getting started experience:
"teleport db configure create", which generates Database Service configuration,
and "teleport db configure bootstrap", which configures IAM permissions for the
Database Service when running on AWS.

CLI commands reference:
- [`teleport db configure
  create`](docs/pages/reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/cli.mdx)
- [`teleport db configure bootstrap`](docs/pages/reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/cli.mdx)

### Moderated Sessions

With Moderated Sessions, Teleport administrators can define policies that allow
users to invite other users to participate in SSH or Kubernetes sessions as
observers, moderators or peers.

[Moderated Sessions guide](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx)

### Breaking Changes

#### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 support was deprecated in Teleport 8 and has now been removed.

#### Desktop access

desktop access now authenticates to LDAP using X.509 client certificates.
Support for the `password_file` configuration option has been removed.

## 8.0.0

Teleport 8.0 is a major release of Teleport that contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### Windows desktop access Preview

Teleport 8.0 includes a preview of the Windows desktop access feature, allowing
users passwordless login to Windows Desktops via any modern web browser.

Teleport users can connect to Active Directory enrolled Windows hosts running
Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer Windows versions.

To try this feature yourself, check out our
[Getting Started Guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx).

Review the desktop access design in:

- [RFD #33](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0033-desktop-access.md)
- [RFD #34](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0034-desktop-access-windows.md)
- [RFD #35](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0035-desktop-access-windows-authn.md)
- [RFD #37](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0037-desktop-access-protocol.md)

#### TLS Routing

In TLS routing mode all client connections are wrapped in TLS and multiplexed on
a single Teleport proxy port.

TLS routing can be enabled by including the following Auth Service configuration:

```yaml
auth_service:
  proxy_listener_mode: multiplex
  ...
```

and setting proxy configuration version to `v2` to prevent legacy listeners from
being created:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_service:
  ...
```

#### AWS CLI

Teleport application access extends AWS console support to CLI . Users are able
to log into their AWS console using `tsh apps login` and use `tsh aws` commands
to interact with AWS APIs.

See more info in the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console.mdx).

#### Application and Database Dynamic Registration

With dynamic registration users are able to manage applications and databases
without needing to update static YAML configuration or restart application or
database agents.

See dynamic registration guides for
[apps](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx)
and
[databases](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx).

#### RDS Automatic Discovery

With RDS auto discovery Teleport database agents can automatically discover RDS
instances and Aurora clusters in an AWS account.

See updated
[RDS guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx) for
more information.

#### WebAuthn

WebAuthn support enables Teleport users to use modern multi-factor options,
including Apple FaceID and TouchID.

In addition, the Teleport Web UI includes new multi-factor management tools,
enabling users to configure and update their multi-factor devices via their
web browser.

Lastly, our UI becomes more secure by requiring an additional multi-factor
confirmation for certain privileged actions (editing roles for multi-factor
confirmation, for example).

  [#8119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8119)

### Breaking Changes

#### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 support will be deprecated in Teleport 8 and removed in Teleport 9.

Teleport 8 will continue to receive security patches for about 9 months after
which it will be EOL. Users are encouraged to upgrade to CentOS 7 in that time
frame.

#### Updated  dependencies

New run time dependencies have been added to Teleport 8 due to the inclusion of
Rust in the build chain. Teleport 8 requires `libgcc_s.so` and `libm.so` be
installed on systems running Teleport.

Users of [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
container images are encouraged to use the
[gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/blob/main/examples/rust/Dockerfile)
image to run Teleport.

```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11
```

Alpine users are recommended to install the `libgcc` package in addition to any
glibc compatibility layer they have already been using.

```
apk --update --no-cache add libgcc
```

#### Database access Certificates

With the `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` flag removed in Go 1.17, database access users
will no longer be able to connect to databases that include their hostname in
the `CommonName` field of the presented certificate. Users are recommended to
update their database certificates to include hostname in the
`Subject Alternative Name` extension instead.

Subscribe to Github issue
[#7636](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/7636) which will add
ability to control level of TLS verification as a workaround.

#### Role Changes

New clusters will no longer have the default `admin` role, it has been replaced
with 3 smaller scoped roles: `access`, `auditor`, and `editor`.

## 7.0.0

Teleport 7.0 is a major release of Teleport that contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### MongoDB

Added support for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) to Teleport database access. [#6600](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6600).

View the [database access with MongoDB](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/mongodb-self-hosted.mdx) for more details.

#### Cloud SQL MySQL

Added support for [GCP Cloud SQL MySQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql) to Teleport database access. [#7302](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7302)

View the Cloud SQL MySQL [guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-google-cloud-databases/mysql-cloudsql.mdx) for more details.

#### AWS Console

Added support for [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console) to Teleport application access. [#7590](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7590)

Teleport application access can now automatically sign users into the AWS Management Console using [Identity federation](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation). View AWS Management Console [guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console.mdx) for more details.

#### Restricted Sessions

Added the ability to block network traffic (IPv4 and IPv6) on a per-SSH session basis. Implemented using BPF tooling which required kernel 5.8 or above. [#7099](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7099)

#### Enhanced Session Recording

Updated Enhanced Session Recording to no longer require the installation of external compilers like `bcc-tools`. Implemented using BPF tooling which required kernel 5.8 or above. [#6027](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6027)

### Improvements

* Added the ability to terminate database access certificates when the certificate expires. [#5476](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5476)
* Added additional FedRAMP compliance controls, such as custom disconnect and MOTD messages. [#6091](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6091) [#7396](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7396)
* Added the ability to export Audit Log and session recordings using the Teleport API. [#6731](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6731) [#7360](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7360)
* Added the ability to partially configure a cluster. [#5857](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5857) [RFD #28](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0028-cluster-config-resources.md)
* Added the ability to disable port forwarding on a per-host basis. [#6989](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6989)
* Added ability to configure `tsh` home directory. [#7035](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7035/files)
* Added ability to generate OpenSSH client configuration snippets using `tsh config`. [#7437](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7437)
* Added default-port detection to `tsh` [#6374](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6374)
* Improved performance of the Web UI for users with many roles. [#7588](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7588)

### Fixes

* Fixed a memory leak that could affect etcd users. [#7631](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7631)
* Fixed an issue where `tsh login` could fail if the user had multiple public addresses defined on the proxy. [#7368](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7368)

### Breaking Changes

#### Enhanced Session Recording

Enhanced Session Recording has been updated to use CO-RE BPF executables. This means that you no longer have to install `bcc-tools`, but comes with a higher minimum kernel version of 5.8 and above. [#6027](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6027)

#### Kubernetes access

Kubernetes access will no longer automatically register a cluster named after the Teleport cluster if the proxy is running within a Kubernetes cluster. Users wishing to retain this functionality now have to explicitly set `kube_cluster_name`. [#6786](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6786)

#### `tsh`

`tsh login` has been updated to no longer change the current Kubernetes context. While `tsh login` will write credentials to `kubeconfig` it will only update your context if `tsh login --kube-cluster` or `tsh kube login <kubeCluster>` is used. [#6045](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6045)

## 6.2

Teleport 6.2 contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

**Note:** the DynamoDB indexing change described below may cause rate-limiting
errors from AWS APIs and is slow on large deployments (1000+ existing audit
events). The next patch release, v6.2.1, will improve the migration performance.
If you run a large DynamoDB-based cluster, we advise you to wait for v6.2.1
before upgrading.

### New Features

#### Added Amazon Redshift Support

Added support for [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift) to Teleport database access.[#6479](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6479).

View the [database access with Redshift on AWS guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/postgres-redshift.mdx) for more details.

### Improvements

* Added pass-through header support for Teleport application access. [#6601](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6601)
* Added ability to propagate claim information from root to leaf clusters. [#6540](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6540)
* Added Proxy Protocol for MySQL database access. [#6594](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6594)
* Added prepared statement support for Postgres database access. [#6303](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6303)
* Added `GetSessionEventsRequest` RPC endpoint for Audit Log pagination. [RFD 19](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0019-event-iteration-api.md) [#6731](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6731)
* Changed DynamoDB indexing strategy for events. [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583)

### Fixes

* Fixed multiple per-session MFA issues. [#6542](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6542) [#6567](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6567) [#6625](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6625) [#6779](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6779) [#6948](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6948)

* Fixed issue where `kubectl exec` sessions were not being recorded when the target pod was killed. [#6068](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6068)
* Fixed an issue that prevented Teleport from starting on ARMv7 systems. [#6711](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6711).
* Fixed issue that caused Access Requests to inconsistently allow elevated Kubernetes access. [#6492](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6492)
* Fixed an issue that could cause `session.end` events not to be emitted. [#6756](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6756)
* Fixed an issue with PAM variable interpolation. [#6558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6558)

### Breaking Changes

#### Agent Forwarding

Teleport 6.2 brings a potentially backward incompatible change with `tsh` agent forwarding.

Prior to Teleport 6.2, `tsh ssh -A` would create an in-memory SSH agent from your `~/.tsh` directory and forward that agent to the target host.

Starting in Teleport 6.2 `tsh ssh -A` by default now forwards your system SSH agent (available at `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Users wishing to retain the prior behavior can use `tsh ssh -o "ForwardAgent local"`.

For more details see [RFD 22](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0022-ssh-agent-forwarding.md) and implementation in [#6525](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6525).

#### DynamoDB Indexing Change

DynamoDB users should note that the events backend indexing strategy has
changed and a data migration will be triggered after upgrade. For optimal
performance perform this migration with only one Auth Service instance online. It may
take some time and progress will be periodically written to the Auth Service
log. During this migration, only events that have been migrated will appear in
the Web UI. After completion, all events will be available.

For more details see [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) and implementation in [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583).

## 6.1.5

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Added additional Prometheus Metrics. [#6511](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6511)
* Updated the TLS handshake timeout to 5 seconds to avoid timeout issues on large clusters. [#6692](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6692)
* Fixed issue that caused non-interactive SSH output to show up in logs. [#6683](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6683)
* Fixed two issues that could cause Teleport to panic upon startup. [#6431](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6431) [#5712](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5712)

## 6.1.3

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where DEB builds were not published to the [Teleport DEB repository](https://deb.releases.teleport.dev/).

## 6.1.0

Teleport 6.1 contains multiple new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### U2F for Kubernetes and SSH sessions

Added support for U2F authentication on every SSH and Kubernetes "connection" (a single `tsh ssh` or `kubectl` call). This is an advanced security feature that protects users against compromises of their on-disk Teleport certificates. Per-session MFA can be enforced cluster-wide or only for some specific roles.

For more details see [Per-Session
MFA](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa.mdx) documentation or
[RFD
14](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0014-session-2FA.md)
and [RFD
15](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0015-2fa-management.md)
for technical details.

## 6.0.0

Teleport 6.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes.

We have implemented [database access](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx),
open sourced role-based access control (RBAC), and added official API and a Go client library.

Users can review the [6.0 milestone](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/33?closed=1) on Github for more details.

### New Features

#### Database access

Review the database access design in [RFD #11](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0011-database-access.md).

With database access users can connect to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases using short-lived certificates, configure SSO authentication and role-based access controls for databases, and capture SQL query activity in the audit log.

##### Getting Started

Configure database access following the [Getting Started](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/getting-started.mdx/) guide.

##### Guides

* [AWS RDS/Aurora
  PostgreSQL](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx)
* [AWS RDS/Aurora MySQL](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx)
* [Self-hosted PostgreSQL](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/postgres-self-hosted.mdx)

##### Resources

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for database access, check out the [RBAC](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx) section.

[Architecture](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx) provides a more in-depth look at database access internals such as networking and security.

See [Reference](docs/pages/reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/database-access-reference.mdx) for an overview of database access related configuration and CLI commands.

Finally, check out [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/faq.mdx).

#### OSS RBAC

Open source RBAC support was introduced in [RFD #7](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0007-rbac-oss.md).

RBAC support gives OSS administrators more granular access controls to servers and other resources with a cluster (like session recording access). An example of an RBAC policy could be: "admins can do anything, developers must never touch production servers and interns can only SSH into staging servers as guests"

In addition, some Access Workflow Plugins will now become available to open source users.

* Access Workflows Golang SDK and API
* Slack
* Gitlab
* Mattermost
* JIRA Plugin
* PagerDuty Plugin

#### Client libraries and API

API and Client Libraries support was introduced in [RFD #10](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0010-api.md).

The new API and client library reduces the dependencies needed to use the Teleport API as well as making it easier to use. An example of using the new API is below.

```go
// Create a client connected to the Auth server with an exported identity file.
clt, err := client.NewClient(client.Config{
  Addrs: []string{"auth.example.com:3025"},
  Credentials: []client.Credentials{
    client.LoadIdentityFile("identity.pem"),
  },
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v.", err)
}
defer clt.Close()

// Create a Access Request.
accessRequest, err := types.NewAccessRequest(uuid.New(), "access-admin", "admin")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to build access request: %v.", err)
}
if err = clt.CreateAccessRequest(ctx, accessRequest); err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create access request: %v.", err)
}
```

### Improvements

* Added `utmp`/`wtmp` support for SSH in [#5491](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5491).
* Added the ability to set a Kubernetes specific public address in [#5611](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5611).
* Added Proxy Protocol support to Kubernetes access in [#5299](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5299).
* Added ACME ([Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) support to make getting and using TLS certificates easier. [#5177](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5177).
* Added the ability to manage local users to the Web UI in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Added the ability to preserve timestamps when using `tsh scp` in [#2889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2889).

### Fixes

* Fixed authentication failure when logging in via CLI with Access Workflows after removing `.tsh` directory in [#5323](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5323).
* Fixed `tsh login` failure when `--proxy` differs from actual proxy public address in [#5380](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5380).
* Fixed session playback issues in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Fixed several UX issues in [#5559](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5559), [#5568](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5568), [#4965](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4965), and [#5057](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5057).

### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](docs/pages/admin-guides/management/admin.mdx) to upgrade your cluster.

Note, for clusters using GitHub SSO and Trusted Clusters, when upgrading SSO users will lose connectivity to leaf clusters. Local users will not be affected.

To restore connectivity to leaf clusters for SSO users, leaf admins should update the `trusted_cluster` role mapping resource like below.

```yaml
kind: trusted_cluster
version: v2
metadata:
   name: "zztop-oss"
spec:
   enabled: true
   token: "bar"
   web_proxy_addr: 172.10.1.1:3080
   tunnel_addr: 172.10.1.1:3024
   role_map:
   - remote: "admin"
     local: ['admin']
   - remote: "^(github-.*)$"
     local: ['admin']
```

## 5.1.0

This release of Teleport adds a new feature.

* Support for creating and assuming Access Workflow requests from within the Web UI (first step toward full Workflow UI support: [#4937](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4937)).

## 5.0.2

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5119).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their Auth Service to version 5.0.2 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.


## 5.0.1

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Always set expiry times on server resource in heartbeats [#5008](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5008)
* Fixes streaming k8s responses (`kubectl logs -f`, `kubectl run -it`, etc) [#5009](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5009)
* Multiple fixes for the k8s forwarder [#5038](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5038)

## 5.0.0

Teleport 5.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes. Users can review [5.0 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/39?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

Teleport 5.0 introduces two distinct features: Teleport application access and significant Kubernetes access improvements - multi-cluster support.

##### Teleport application access

Teleport can now be used to provide secure access to web applications. This new feature was built with the express intention of securing internal apps which might have once lived on a VPN or had an authorization and authentication mechanism with little to no audit trail. application access works with everything from dashboards to single page Javascript applications (SPA).

Application access uses mutually authenticated reverse tunnels to establish a secure connection with the Teleport unified Access Platform which can then becomes the single ingress point for all traffic to an internal application.

Adding an application follows the same UX as adding SSH servers or Kubernetes clusters, starting with creating a static or dynamic invite token.

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=app
```

Then simply start Teleport with a few new flags.

```sh
$ teleport start --roles=app --token=xyz --auth-server=proxy.example.com:3080 \
    --app-name="example-app" \
    --app-uri="http://localhost:8080"
```

This command will start an app server that proxies the application "example-app" running at `http://localhost:8080` at the public address `https://example-app.example.com`.

Applications can also be configured using the new `app_service` section in `teleport.yaml`.

```yaml
app_service:
   # Teleport application access is enabled.
   enabled: yes
   # We've added a default sample app that will check
   # that Teleport application access is working
   # and output JWT tokens.
   # https://dumper.teleport.example.com:3080/
   debug_app: true
   apps:
   # application access can be used to proxy any HTTP endpoint.
   # Note: Name can't include any spaces and should be DNS-compatible A-Za-z0-9-._
   - name: "internal-dashboard"
     uri: "http://10.0.1.27:8000"
     # By default Teleport will make this application
     # available on a sub-domain of your Teleport proxy's hostname
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # - thus the importance of setting up wildcard DNS.
     # If you want, it's possible to set up a custom public url.
     # DNS records should point to the proxy server.
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # Example Public URL for the internal-dashboard app.
     # public_addr: "internal-dashboard.acme.com"
     # Optional labels
     # Labels can be combined with RBAC rules to provide access.
     labels:
       customer: "acme"
       env: "production"
     # Optional dynamic labels
     commands:
     - name: "os"
       command: ["/usr/bin/uname"]
       period: "5s"
     # A proxy can support multiple applications. application access
     # can also be deployed with a Teleport node.
     - name: "arris"
       uri: "http://localhost:3001"
       public_addr: "arris.example.com"
```

Application access requires two additional changes. DNS must be updated to point the application domain to the proxy and the proxy must be loaded with a TLS certificate for the domain. Wildcard DNS and TLS certificates can be used to simplify deployment.

```yaml
# When adding the app_service certificates are required to provide a TLS
# connection. The certificates are managed by the proxy_service
proxy_service:
  # We've extended support for https certs. Teleport can now load multiple
  # TLS certificates. In the below example we've obtained a wildcard cert
  # that'll be used for proxying the applications.
  # The correct certificate is selected based on the hostname in the HTTPS
  # request using SNI.
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
```

##### Teleport Kubernetes access

Teleport 5.0 also introduces two highly requested features for Kubernetes.

* The ability to connect multiple Kubernetes Clusters to the Teleport Access Platform, greatly reducing operational complexity.
* Complete Kubernetes audit log capture [#4526](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4526), going beyond the existing `kubectl exec` capture.

For a full overview please review the [Kubernetes RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0005-kubernetes-service.md).

To support these changes, we've introduced a new service. This moves Teleport Kubernetes configuration from the `proxy_service` into its own dedicated `kubernetes_service` section.

When adding the new Kubernetes service, a new type of join token is required.

```bash
tctl tokens add --type=kube
```

Example configuration for the new `kubernetes_service`:

```yaml
# ...
kubernetes_service:
   enabled: yes
   listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027
   kubeconfig_file: /secrets/kubeconfig
```

Note: a Kubernetes port still needs to be configured in the `proxy_service` via `kube_listen_addr`.

#### New "tsh kube" commands

`tsh kube` commands are used to query registered clusters and switch `kubeconfig` context:

```sh
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=awly

# list all registered clusters
$ tsh kube ls
Cluster Name       Status
-------------      ------
a.k8s.example.com  online
b.k8s.example.com  online
c.k8s.example.com  online

# on login, kubeconfig is pointed at the first cluster (alphabetically)
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com

# but all clusters are populated as contexts
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                     CLUSTER             AUTHINFO
*         proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# switch between different clusters:
$ tsh kube login c.k8s.example.com

# the traditional way is also supported:
$ kubectl config use-context proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# check current cluster
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com
```

Other Kubernetes changes:

* Support k8s clusters behind firewall/NAT using a single Teleport cluster [#3667](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3667)
* Support multiple k8s clusters with a single Teleport proxy instance [#3952](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3952)

##### Additional User and Token Resource

We've added two new RBAC resources; these provide the ability to limit token creation and to list and modify Teleport users:

```yaml
- resources: [user]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
- resources: [token]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
```

Learn more about [Teleport's RBAC Resources](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-controls.mdx)

##### Cluster Labels

Teleport 5.0 also adds the ability to set labels on Trusted Clusters. The labels are set when creating a trusted cluster invite token. This lets teams use the same RBAC controls used on nodes to approve or deny access to clusters. This can be especially useful for MSPs that connect hundreds of customers' clusters - when combined with access workflows, cluster access can be delegated. Learn more by reviewing our [Truster Cluster Setup & RBAC Docs](docs/pages/admin-guides/management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx)

Creating a trusted cluster join token for a production environment:

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=trusted_cluster --labels=env=prod
```

```yaml
kind: role
#...
  deny:
    # cluster labels control what clusters user can connect to. The wildcard ('*')
    # means any cluster. By default, deny rules are empty to preserve backwards
    # compatibility
    cluster_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

##### Teleport UI Updates

Teleport 5.0 also iterates on the UI Refresh from 4.3. We've moved the cluster list into our sidebar and have added an Application launcher. For customers moving from 4.4 to 5.0, you'll notice that we have moved session recordings back to their own dedicated section.

Other updates:

* We now provide local user management via `https://[cluster-url]/web/users`, providing the ability to edit, reset and delete local users.
* Teleport Node & App Install scripts. This is currently an Enterprise-only feature that provides customers with an 'auto-magic' installer script. Enterprise customers can enable this feature by modifying the 'token' resource. See note above.
* We've added a Waiting Room for customers using Access Workflows. [Docs](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins.mdx)

##### Signed RPM and Releases

Starting with Teleport 5.0, we now provide an RPM repo for stable releases of Teleport. We've also started signing our RPMs to provide assurance that you're always using an official build of Teleport.

See https://rpm.releases.teleport.dev/ for more details.

#### Improvements

* Added `--format=json` playback option for `tsh play`. For example `tsh play --format=json ~/play/0c0b81ed-91a9-4a2a-8d7c-7495891a6ca0.tar | jq '.event` can be used to show all events within an a local archive. [#4578](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4578)
* Added support for continuous backups and auto scaling for DynamoDB. [#4780](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4780)
* Added a Linux ARM64/ARMv8 (64-bit) Release. [#3383](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3383)
* Added `https_keypairs` field which replaces `https_key_file` and `https_cert_file`. This allows administrators to load multiple HTTPS certs for Teleport application access. Teleport 5.0 is backwards compatible with the old format, but we recommend updating your configuration to use `https_keypairs`.

Enterprise Only:

* `tctl` can load credentials from `~/.tsh` [#4678](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4678)
* Teams can require a user submitted reason when using Access Workflows [#4573](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4573#issuecomment-720777443)

#### Fixes

* Updated `tctl` to always format resources as lists in JSON/YAML. [#4281](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4281)
* Updated `tsh status` to now print Kubernetes status. [#4348](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4348)
* Fixed intermittent issues with `loginuid.so`. [#3245](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3245)
* Reduced `access denied to Proxy` log spam. [#2920](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2920)
* Various AMI fixes: paths are now consistent with other Teleport packages and configuration files will not be overwritten on reboot.

#### Documentation

We've added an [API Guide](docs/pages/admin-guides/api/api.mdx) to simply developing applications against Teleport.

#### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](./docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

* Optional: Consider updating `https_key_file` & `https_cert_file` to our new `https_keypairs:` format.
* Optional: Consider migrating Kubernetes access from `proxy_service` to `kubernetes_service` after the upgrade.

### 4.4.6

This release of teleport contains a security fix and a bug fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5120](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5120).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their Auth Service to version 4.4.6 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

* Fix an issue where `tsh login` would fail with an `AccessDenied` error if
the user was perviously logged into a leaf cluster. [#5105](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5105)

### 4.4.5

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where a slow or unresponsive Teleport Auth Service instance could hang client connections in async recording mode. [#4696](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4696)

### 4.4.4

This release of Teleport adds enhancements to the Access Workflows API.

* Support for creating limited roles that trigger Access Requests
on login, allowing users to be configured such that no nodes can
be accessed without externally granted roles.

* Teleport UI support for automatically generating Access Requests and
assuming new roles upon approval (Access Requests were previously
only available in `tsh`).

* New `claims_to_roles` mapping that can use claims from external
identity providers to determine which roles a user can request.

* Various minor API improvements to help make requests easier to
manage and audit, including support for human-readable
request/approve/deny reasons and structured annotations.

### 4.4.2

This release of Teleport adds support for a new build architecture.

* Added automatic arm64 builds of Teleport to the download portal.

### 4.4.1

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where defining multiple logging configurations would cause Teleport to crash. [#4598](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4598)

### 4.4.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.4 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/40?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Concurrent Session Control

This addition to Teleport helps customers obtain AC-10 control. We now provide two new optional configuration values: `max_connections` and `max_sessions`.

###### `max_connections`

This value is the total number of concurrent sessions within a cluster to nodes running Teleport. This value is applied at a per user level. If you set `max_connections` to `1`, a `tsh` user would only be able to `tsh ssh` into one node at a time.

###### `max_sessions` per connection

This value limits the total number of session channels which can be established across a single SSH connection (typically used for interactive terminals or remote exec operations). This is for cases where nodes have Teleport set up, but a user is using OpenSSH to connect to them. It is essentially equivalent to the `MaxSessions` configuration value accepted by `sshd`.

```yaml
spec:
  options:
    # Optional: Required to be set for AC-10 Compliance
    max_connections: 2
    # Optional: To match OpenSSH behavior set to 10
    max_sessions: 10
```

###### `session_control_timeout`

A new `session_control_timeout` configuration value has been added to the `auth_service` configuration block of the Teleport config file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.

```yaml
auth_service:
  session_control_timeout: 2m # default
# ...
```

#### Session Streaming Improvements

Teleport 4.4 includes a complete refactoring of our event system. This resolved a few customer bug reports such as [#3800: Events overwritten in DynamoDB](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3800) and [#3182: Teleport consuming all disk space with multipart uploads](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3182).

Along with foundational improvements, 4.4 includes two new experimental `session_recording` options: `node-sync` and `proxy-sync`.
NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport Auth Service instances, Proxy Service instances, and nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.

```yaml
# This section configures the Auth Service:
auth_service:
    # Optional setting for configuring session recording. Possible values are:
    #     "node"  : sessions will be recorded on the node level (the default)
    #     "proxy" : recording on the proxy level, see "recording proxy mode" section.
    #     "off"   : session recording is turned off
    #
    #     EXPERIMENTAL *-sync modes: proxy and node send logs directly to S3 or other
    #     storage without storing the records on disk at all. This mode will kill a
    #     connection if network connectivity is lost.
    #     NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport Auth Service instances, 
    #     Proxy Service instances, and nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.
    #
    #     "node-sync" : sessions recording will be streamed from node -> auth -> storage
    #     "proxy-sync : sessions recording will be streamed from proxy -> auth -> storage
    #
    session_recording: "node-sync"
```

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5122](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5122).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their Auth Service to version 4.3.9 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.3.8

This release of Teleport adds support for a new build architecture.

* Added automatic arm64 builds of Teleport to the download portal.

## 4.3.7

This release of Teleport contains a security fix and a bug fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2020-15216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15216) by updating github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig.

### Details
A vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` library which is used by Teleport to validate the
signatures of XML files used to configure SAML 2.0 connectors. With a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely
bypass XML signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one.

### Actions
The `goxmldsig` library has been updated upstream and Teleport 4.3.7 includes the fix. Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta,
Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their Auth Service to version 4.3.7 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.3.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.3 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/37?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Web UI

Teleport 4.3 includes a completely redesigned Web UI. The new Web UI expands the management functionality of a Teleport cluster and the user experience of using Teleport. Teleport's new terminal provides a jumping-off point to access nodes and nodes on other clusters via the web.

Teleport's Web UI now exposes Teleport’s Audit log, letting auditors and administrators view Teleport access events, SSH events, recording session, and enhanced session recording all in one view.

##### Teleport Plugins

Teleport 4.3 introduces four new plugins that work out of the box with [Approval Workflow](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins.mdx). These plugins allow you to automatically support role escalation with commonly used third party services. The built-in plugins are listed below.

*   [PagerDuty](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-pagerduty.mdx)
*   [Jira](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-jira.mdx)
*   [Slack](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-slack.mdx)
*   [Mattermost](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-mattermost.mdx)

#### Improvements

*   Added support for OpenSSH-like escape sequence. [#3752](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3752)
*   Added `--browser` flag to `tsh`. [#3737](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3737)
*   Updated `teleport configure` output to be more useful out of the box. [#3429](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3429)
*   Updated ability to only show SSO on the login page. [#2789](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2789)
*   Updated help and support section in Web UI. [#3531](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3531)
*   Updated default SSH signing algorithm to SHA-512 for new clusters. [#3777](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/3777)

*   Fixed Vulnerabilities in Teleport Docker Image [https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport?tab=tags)

#### Upgrade Notes

Always follow the [recommended upgrade
procedure](./docs/pages/upgrading.mdx) to upgrade to this version.

##### New Signing Algorithm

If you’re upgrading an existing version of Teleport, you may want to consider rotating CA to SHA-256 or SHA-512 for RSA SSH certificate signatures. The previous default was SHA-1, which is now considered to be weak against brute-force attacks. SHA-1 certificate signatures are also [no longer accepted](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) by OpenSSH versions 8.2 and above. All new Teleport clusters will default to SHA-512 based signatures. To upgrade an existing cluster, set the following in your `teleport.yaml`:

```
teleport:
    ca_signature_algo: "rsa-sha2-512"
```

Rotate the cluster CA, following [these
docs](docs/pages/admin-guides/management/operations/ca-rotation.mdx).

##### Web UI

Due to the number of changes included in the redesigned Web UI, some URLs and functionality have shifted. Refer to the following ticket for more details. [#3580](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3580)

##### RBAC for Audit Log and Recorded Sessions

Teleport 4.3 has made the audit log accessible via the Web UI. Enterprise customers
can limit access by changing the options on the new `event` resource.

```yaml
# list and read audit log, including audit events and recorded sessions
- resources: [event]
  verbs: [list, read]
```

##### Kubernetes Permissions

The minimum set of Kubernetes permissions that need to be granted to Teleport
proxies has been updated. If you use the Kubernetes integration, please make
sure that the ClusterRole used by the proxy has [sufficient
permissions](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx).

##### Path prefix for etcd

The [etcd backend](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx#etcd) now correctly uses
the “prefix” config value when storing data. Upgrading from 4.2 to 4.3 will
migrate the data as needed at startup. Make sure you follow our Teleport
[upgrade guidance](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

**Note: If you use an etcd backend with a non-default prefix and need to downgrade from 4.3 to 4.2, you should [backup Teleport data and restore it](docs/pages/admin-guides/management/operations/backup-restore.mdx) into the downgraded cluster.**

## 4.2.12

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2020-15216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15216) by updating github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig.

### Details
A vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` library which is used by Teleport to validate the
signatures of XML files used to configure SAML 2.0 connectors. With a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely
bypass XML signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one.

### Actions
The `goxmldsig` library has been updated upstream and Teleport 4.2.12 includes the fix. Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta,
Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their Auth Service to version 4.2.12 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.2.7

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

## 4.0.0

This is a major Teleport release which introduces support for Teleport Internet of Things (IoT). In addition to this new feature this release includes usability, performance, and bug fixes listed below.

### New Features

#### Teleport for IoT

With Teleport 4.0, nodes gain the ability to use reverse tunnels to dial back to a Teleport cluster to bypass firewall restrictions. This allows connections even to nodes that a cluster does not have direct network access to. Customers that have been using Trusted Clusters to achieve this can now utilize a unified interface to access all nodes within their infrastructure.

#### FedRamp Compliance

With this release of Teleport, we have built out the foundation to help Teleport Enterprise customers build and meet the requirements in a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP). This includes a FIPS 140-2 friendly build of Teleport Enterprise as well as a variety of improvements to aid in complying with security controls even in FedRAMP High environments.

### Improvements

* Teleport now support 10,000 remote connections to a single Teleport cluster. [Using our recommend hardware setup.](docs/pages/admin-guides/management/operations/scaling.mdx)
* Added ability to delete node using `tctl rm`. [#2685](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2685)
* Output of `tsh ls` is now sorted by node name. [#2534](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2534)

### Bug Fixes

* Switched to `xdg-open` to open a browser window on Linux. [#2536](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2536)
* Increased SSO callback timeout to 180 seconds. [#2533](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2533)
* Set permissions on TTY similar to OpenSSH. [#2508](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2508)

The lists of improvements and bug fixes above mention only the significant changes, please take a look at the complete list on Github for more.

### Upgrading

Teleport 4.0 is backwards compatible with Teleport 3.2 and later. [Follow the recommended upgrade procedure to upgrade to this version.](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx)

Note that due to substantial changes between Teleport 3.2 and 4.0, we recommend creating a backup of the backend datastore (DynamoDB, etcd, or dir) before upgrading a cluster to Teleport 4.0 to allow downgrades.

#### Notes on compatibility

Teleport has always validated host certificates when a client connects to a server, however prior to Teleport 4.0, Teleport did not validate the host the user requests a connection to is in the list of principals on the certificate. To avoid issues during the upgrade, make sure the hosts you connect to have the appropriate address set in `public_addr` in `teleport.yaml` before upgrading.

## 2.6.0

This release of Teleport brings new features, significant performance and
usability improvements as well usual bugfixes.

During this release cycle, the Teleport source code has been audited for
security vulnerabilities by Cure53 and this release (2.6.0) contains patches
for the discovered problems.

#### New Features

* Support for DynamoDB for storing the audit log events. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for Amazon S3 for storing the recorded SSH sessions. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for rotating certificate authorities (CA rotation). [#1899] (https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1899)
* Integration with Linux PAM (pluggable authentication modules) subsystem. [#742](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/742) and [#1766](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1766)
* The new CLI command `tsh status` shows users which Teleport clusters they are authenticated with. [#1628](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1628)

Additionally, Teleport 2.6.0 has been submitted to the AWS marketplace. Soon
AWS users will be able to create properly configured, secure and highly
available Teleport clusters with ease.

#### Configuration Changes

* Role templates (depreciated in Teleport 2.3) were fully removed. We recommend
  migrating to role variables which are documented [here](docs/pages/admin-guides/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx)

* Resource names (like roles, connectors, trusted clusters) can no longer
  contain unicode or other special characters. Update the names of all user
  created resources to only include characters, hyphens, and dots.

* `advertise_ip` has been deprecated and replaced with `public_addr` setting. See [#1803](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1803)
  The existing configuration files will still work, but we advise Teleport
  administrators to update it to reflect the new format.

* Teleport no longer uses `boltdb` back-end for storing cluster state _by
  default_.  The new default is called `dir` and it uses JSON files
  stored in `/var/lib/teleport/backend`. This change applies to brand new
  Teleport installations, the existing clusters will continue to use `boltdb`.

* The default set of enabled cryptographic primitives has been
  updated to reflect the latest state of SSH and TLS security. [#1856](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1856).

#### Bug Fixes

The list of most visible bug fixes in this release:

* `tsh` now properly handles Ctrl+C [#1882](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1882)
* High CPU utilization on ARM platforms during daemon start-up. [#1886](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1886)
* Terminal window size can get out of sync on AWS. [#1874](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1874)
* Some CLI commands print errors twice. [#1889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1889)
* SSH session playback can be interrupted for long sessions. [#1774](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1774)
* Processing `HUP` UNIX signal is unreliable when `teleport` daemon runs under `systemd`. [#1844](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1844)

## 2.5.0

This is a major release of Teleport. Its goal is to make cloud-native
deployments easier. Numerous AWS users have contributed feedback to this
release, which includes:

#### New Features

* Auth servers in highly available (HA) configuration can share the same `/var/lib/teleport`
  data directory when it's hosted on NFS (or AWS EFS).
  [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)

* There is now an AWS reference deployment in `examples/aws` directory.  It
  uses Terraform and demonstrates how to deploy large Teleport clusters on AWS
  using best practices like auto-scaling groups, security groups, secrets
  management, load balancers, etc.

* The Teleport daemon now implements built-in connection draining which allows
  zero-downtime upgrades.  [See
  documentation](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

* Dynamic join tokens for new nodes can now be explicitly set via `tctl node add --token`.
  This allows Teleport admins to use an external mechanism for generating
  cluster invitation tokens.
  [#1615](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1615)

* Teleport now correctly manages certificates for accessing proxies behind a
  load balancer with the same domain name. The new configuration parameter
  `public_addr` must be used for this.
  [#1174](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1174).

#### Improvements

* Switching to a new TLS-based Auth Service API improves performance of large clusters.
  [#1528](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* Session recordings are now compressed by default using gzip. This reduces storage
  requirements by up to 80% in our real-world tests.
  [#1579](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* More user-friendly authentication errors in Teleport audit log helps Teleport admins
  troubleshoot configuration errors when integrating with SAML/OIDC providers.
  [#1554](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1554),
  [#1553](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1553),
  [#1599](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1599)

* `tsh` client will now report if a server's API is no longer compatible.

#### Bug Fixes

* `tsh logout` will now correctly log out from all active Teleport sessions. This is useful
  for users who're connected to multiple Teleport clusters at the same time.
  [#1541](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1541)

* When parsing YAML, Teleport now supports `--` list item separator to create
  multiple resources with a single `tctl create` command.
  [#1663](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1663)

* Fixed a panic in the Web UI backend [#1558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1558)

#### Behavior Changes

Certain components of Teleport behave differently in version 2.5. It is important to
note that these changes are not breaking Teleport functionality. They improve
Teleport behavior on large clusters deployed on highly dynamic cloud
environments such as AWS. This includes:

* Session list in the Web UI is now limited to 1,000 sessions.
* The audit log and recorded session storage has been moved from `/var/lib/teleport/log`
  to `/var/lib/teleport/log/<auth-server-id>`. This is related to [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)
  described above.
* When connecting a trusted cluster users can no longer pick an arbitrary name for them.
  Their own (local) names will be used, i.e. the `cluster_name` setting now defines how
  the cluster is seen from the outside.
  [#1543](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1543)

## 2.4.0

This release adds two major new features and a few improvements and bugfixes.

#### New Features

* New Commercial Teleport Editions: "Pro" and "Business" allow users to
  purchase a Teleport subscription without signing contracts.
* Teleport now supports SSH session recording even for nodes running OpenSSH [#1327](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1327)
  This feature is called "recording proxy mode".
* Users of open source edition of Teleport can now authenticate against Github [#1445](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1445)

## 2.0.5

Teleport 2.0.5 contains a variety of security fixes. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 2.0.0 and above to upgrade to 2.0.5.

The most pressing issues (a phishing attack which can potentially be used to extract plaintext credentials and an attack where an already authenticated user can escalate privileges) can be resolved by upgrading the web proxy. However, however all nodes need to be upgraded to mitigate all vulnerabilities.

### Bugfixes

* Patch for TLP-01-001 and TLP-01-003: Check redirect.
* Patch for TLP-01-004: Always check is namespace is valid.
* Patch for TLP-01-005: Check user principal when joining session.
* Patch for TLP-01-006 and TLP-01-007: Validate Session ID.
* Patch for TLP-01-008: Use a fake hash for password authentication if user does not exist.
* Patch for TLP-01-009: Command injection in scp.
