## 16.0.0 (06/13/24)

Teleport 16 brings the following new features and improvements:

- Teleport VNet
- Device Trust for the Web UI
- Increased support for per-session MFA
- Web UI notification system
- Access requests from the resources view
- `tctl` for Windows
- Teleport plugins improvements

### Description

#### Teleport VNet

Teleport 16 introduces Teleport VNet, a new feature that provides a virtual IP
subnet and DNS server which automatically proxies TCP connections to Teleport
apps over mutually authenticated tunnels.

This allows scripts and software applications to connect to any
Teleport-protected application as if they were connected to a VPN, without the
need to manage local tunnels.

Teleport VNet is powered by the Teleport Connect client and is available for
macOS. Support for other operating systems will come in a future release.

#### Device Trust for the Web UI

Teleport Device Trust can now be enforced for browser-based workflows like
remote desktop and web application access. The Teleport Connect client must be
installed in order to satisfy device locality checks.

#### Increased support for per-session MFA

Teleport 16 now supports per-session MFA checks when accessing both web and TCP
applications via all supported clients (Web UI, `tsh`, and Teleport Connect).

Additionally, Teleport Connect now includes support for per-session MFA when
accessing database resources.

#### Web UI notification system

Teleport’s Web UI includes a new notifications system that notifies users of
items requiring attention (for example, access requests needing review).

#### Access requests from the resources view

The resources view in the web UI now shows both resources you currently have
access to and resources you can request access to. This allows users to request
access to resources without navigating to a separate page.

Cluster administrators who prefer the previous behavior of hiding requestable
resources from the main view can set `show_resources: accessible_only` in their
UI config:

For dynamic configuration, run `tctl edit ui_config`:

```yaml
kind: ui_config
version: v1
metadata:
  name: ui-config
spec:
  show_resources: accessible_only
```

Alternatively, self-hosted Teleport users can update the `ui` section of their
proxy configuration:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  enabled: yes
  ui:
    show_resources: accessible_only
```

#### `tctl` for Windows

Teleport 16 includes Windows builds of the `tctl` administrative tool, allowing
Windows users to administer their cluster without the need for a macOS or Linux
workstation.

Additionally, there are no longer enterprise-specific versions of `tctl`. All
Teleport clients (`tsh`, `tctl`, and Teleport Connect) are available in a single
distribution that works on both Enterprise and Community Edition clusters.

#### Teleport plugins improvements

Teleport 16 includes major improvements to the plugins. All plugins now have:

- amd64 and arm64 binaries available
- amd64 and arm64 multi-arch images
- Major and minor version rolling tags (ie
  `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-email:16`)
- Image signatures for all images
- Additional debug images with all of the above features

In addition, we now support plugins for each supported major version, starting
with v15. This means that if we fix a bug or security issue in a v16 plugin
version, we will also apply and release the change for the v15 plugin version.

#### Other

The Jamf plugin now authenticates with Jamf API credentials instead of username
and password.

### Breaking changes and deprecations

#### Community Edition license

Starting with this release, Teleport Community Edition restricts commercial
usage.

https://goteleport.com/blog/teleport-community-license/

#### License file validation on startup

Teleport 16 introduces license file validation on startup. This only applies to
customers running **Teleport Enterprise Self-Hosted**. No action is required for
customers running Teleport Enterprise Cloud or Teleport Community Edition.

If, after updating to Teleport 16, you receive an error message regarding an
outdated license file, follow our step-by-step [guide](docs/pages/choose-an-edition/teleport-enterprise/license.mdx)
to update your license file.

#### Multi-factor authentication is now required for local users

Support for disabling second factor authentication has been removed. Teleport
will refuse to start until the `second_factor` setting is set to `on`, `webauthn`
or `otp`.

This change only affects _self-hosted_ Teleport users, as Teleport Cloud has
always required second factor authentication.

**Important:** To avoid locking users out, we recommend the following steps:

1. Ensure that all cluster administrators have second factor devices registered
   in Teleport so that they will be able to reset any other users.
2. Announce to the user base that all users must register an MFA device.
   Consider creating a cluster alert with `tctl alerts create` to help spread
   the word.
3. While you are still on Teleport 15, set `second_factor: on`. This will help
   identify any users who have not registered MFA devices and allow you to
   quickly revert to `second_factor: optional` if necessary.
4. Upgrade to Teleport 16.

Any users who do not register MFA devices prior to the Teleport 16 upgrade will
be unable to log in and must be reset by an administrator (`tctl users reset`).

#### Incompatible clients are rejected

In accordance with our [component compatibility](docs/pages/upgrading/overview.mdx#component-compatibility)
guidelines, Teleport 16 will start rejecting connections from clients and agents
running incompatible (ie too old) versions.

If Teleport detects connection attempts from outdated clients, it will show an
alert to cluster administrators in both the web UI and `tsh`.

To disable this behavior and run in an unsupported configuration that  allows
incompatible agents to connect to your cluster, start your auth server with the
`TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_ALLOW_OLD_CLIENTS=yes` environment variable.

#### Opsgenie plugin annotations

Prior to Teleport 16, when using an Opsgenie plugin, the `teleport.dev/schedules`
role annotation was used to specify both schedules for access request
notifications as well as schedules to check for the request auto-approval.

Starting with Teleport 16, the annotations were split to provide behavior
consistent with other access request plugins: a role must now contain the
`teleport.dev/notify-services` to receive notifications on Opsgenie and the
`teleport.dev/schedules` to check for auto-approval.

Detailed setup instructions are available in the [documentation](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/branch/v16/docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins/opsgenie.mdx).

#### Teleport Assist has been removed

Teleport Assist chat has been removed from Teleport 16. `auth_service.assist` and `proxy_service.assist`
options have been removed from the configuration. Teleport will not start if these options are present.

During the migration from v15 to v16, the options mentioned above should be removed from the configuration.

#### New required permissions for DynamoDB

Teleport clusters using the DynamoDB backend on AWS now require the
`dynamodb:ConditionCheckItem` permissions. For a full list of required
permissions, see the IAM policy [example](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx#dynamodb).

#### Updated keyboard shortcuts in Teleport connect

On Windows and Linux, some of Teleport Connect’s keyboard shortcuts conflicted
with the default bash or nano shortcuts (Ctrl+E, Ctrl+K, etc). On those
platforms, the default shortcuts have been changed to a combination of
Ctrl+Shift+*.

On macOS, the default shortcut to open a new terminal has been changed to

## 15.3.6 (05/22/24)

This release contains fixes for several high-severity security issues, as well
as numerous other bug fixes and improvements.

### Security Fixes

* **[High]** Fixed unrestricted redirect in SSO Authentication. Teleport didn’t
  sufficiently validate the client redirect URL. This could allow an attacker to
  trick Teleport users into performing an SSO authentication and redirect to an
  attacker-controlled URL allowing them to steal the credentials. [#41834](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41834).

* **[High]** Fixed CockroachDB authorization bypass. When connecting to
  CockroachDB using Database Access, Teleport did not properly consider the
  username case when running RBAC checks. As such, it was possible to establish
  a connection using an explicitly denied username when using a different case.
  [#41823](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41823).
  
* **[High]** Fixed Long-lived connection persistence issue with expired
  certificates. Teleport did not terminate some long-running mTLS-authenticated
  connections past the expiry of client certificates for users with the
  `disconnect_expired_cert` option. This could allow such users to perform
  some API actions after their certificate has expired.  [#41827](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41827).

* **[High]** Fixed PagerDuty integration privilege escalation. When creating a
  role access request, Teleport would include PagerDuty annotations from the
  entire user’s role set rather than a specific role being requested. For users
  who run multiple PagerDuty access plugins with auto-approval, this could
  result in a request for a different role being inadvertently auto-approved 
  than the one which corresponds to the user’s active on-call schedule. [#41837](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41837).
  
* **[High]** Fixed SAML IdP session privilege escalation. When using Teleport as
  SAML IdP, authorization wasn’t properly enforced on the SAML IdP session
  creation. As such, authenticated users could use an internal API to escalate
  their own privileges by crafting a malicious program. [#41846](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41846).  

We strongly recommend all customers upgrade to the latest releases of Teleport.

### Other fixes and improvements

* Fixed access request annotations when annotations contain globs, regular

## 15.3.0 (04/30/24)

### Improved Roles UI

The Roles page of the web UI is now backed by a paginated API, ensuring fast
load times even on clusters with large numbers of roles.

### Resizing for Windows desktop sessions

Windows desktop sessions now automatically resize as the size of the browser
window changes.

### Hardware key support for agentless nodes

Teleport now supports connecting to agentless OpenSSH nodes even when Teleport
is configured to require hardware key MFA checks.

### TPM joining

The new TPM join method enables secure joining for agents and Machine ID bots
that run on-premise. Based on the secure properties of the host's hardware
trusted platform module, this join method removes the need to create and
distribute secret tokens, significantly reducing the risk of exfiltration.

## 15.2.0 (03/29/24)

### Improved Access Requests UI

The access requests page of the web UI will be backed by a paginated API,
ensuring fast load times even on clusters with many access requests.

Additionally, the UI allows you to search for access requests, sort them based
on various attributes, and includes several new filtering options.

### Zero-downtime web asset rollout

Teleport 15.2 changes the way that web assets are served and cached, which will
allow multiple compatible versions of the Teleport Proxy to run behind the same
load balancer.

### Workload Identity MVP

With Teleport 15.2, Machine ID can bootstrap and issue identity to services
across multiple computing environments and organizational boundaries. Workload
Identity issues SPIFFE-compatible x509 certificates that can be used for mTLS
between services.

### Support for Kubernetes 1.29+

The Kubernetes project is deprecating the SPDY protocol for streaming commands
(kubectl exec, kubectl port-forward, etc) and replacing it with a new
websocket-based subprotocol. Teleport 15.2.0 will support the new protocol to
ensure compatibility with newer Kubernetes clusters.

### Automatic database access requests

Both tsh db connect and tsh proxy db will offer the option to submit an access
request if the user attempts to connect to a database that they don't already
have access to.

### GCP console access via Workforce Identity Federation

Teleport administrators will be able to setup access to GCP web console through
Workforce Identity Federation using Teleport as a SAML identity provider.

### IaC support for OpenSSH nodes

Users will be able to register OpenSSH nodes in the cluster using Terraform and
Kubernetes Operator.

### Access requests start time

Users submitting access requests via web UI will be able to request specific
access start time up to a week in advance.

### Terraform and Operator support for agentless SSH nodes

The Teleport Terraform provider and Kubernetes operator now support declaring
agentless OpenSSH and OpenSSH EC2 ICE servers. You can follow [this
guide](docs/pages/management/dynamic-resources/agentless-ssh-servers.mdx)
to register OpenSSH agents with infrastructure as code.

Setting up EC2 ICE automatic discovery with IaC will come in a future update.

### Operator and CRDs can be deployed separately

The `teleport-operator` and `teleport-cluster` charts now support deploying only
the CRD, the CRD and the operator, or only the operator.

From the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart:

```yaml
operator:
  enabled: true|false
  installCRDs: always|never|dynamic
```

From the `teleport-operator` Helm chart:

```yaml
enabled: true|false
installCRDs: always|never|dynamic
```

In dynamic mode (by default), the chart will install CRDs if the operator is
enabled, but will not remove the CRDs if you temporarily disable the operator.

### Operator now propagates labels

Kubernetes CR labels are now copied to the Teleport resource when applicable.
This allows you to configure RBAC for operator-created resources, and to filter
Teleport resources more easily.

### Terraform provider no longer forces resource re-creation on version change

Teleport v15 introduced two Terraform provider changes:
- setting the resource version is now mandatory
- a resource version change triggers the resource re-creation to ensure defaults
  were correctly set

The second change was too disruptive, especially for roles, as they cannot be
deleted if a user or an access list references them. Teleport 15.2 lifts this
restriction and allows version change without forcing the resource deletion.

Another change to ensure resource defaults are correctly set during version
upgrades will happen in v16.

## 15.0.0 (01/31/24)

Teleport 15 brings the following new major features and improvements:

- Desktop access performance improvements
- Enhanced Device Trust support
- SSH connection resumption
- RDS auto-discovery in Access Management UI
- EKS Integration for Teleport
- MFA for Administrative Actions
- Improved SAML IdP configuration flow
- Improved provisioning for Okta
- Support for AWS KMS
- Teleport Connect improvements
- Session playback improvements
- Standalone Kubernetes Operator
- Roles v6 and v7 support for Kubernetes Operator
- Enhanced ARM64 builds

In addition, this release includes several changes that affect existing
functionality listed in the “Breaking changes” section below. Users are advised
to review them before upgrading.

### Description

#### Desktop access performance improvements

Teleport 15 leverages a new, more performant RDP engine, resulting in a smoother
desktop access experience.

#### Device Trust for Linux support

Teleport Device Trust now supports TPM joining on Linux devices.

Additionally, `tsh proxy app` can now solve device challenges, allowing users to
enforce the use of a trusted device to access applications.

#### SSH connection resumption

Teleport v15 introduces automatic SSH connection resumption if the network path
between the client and the Teleport node is interrupted due to connectivity
issues, and transparent connection migration if the control plane is gracefully
upgraded.

The feature is active by default when a v15 client (`tsh`, OpenSSH or PuTTY
configured by `tsh config`, or Teleport Connect) connects to a v15 Teleport
node.

#### RDS auto-discovery in Access Management UI

Users going through the Access Management UI flow to enroll RDS databases are
now able to set up auto-discovery.

#### EKS Integration for Teleport

Teleport now allows users to enroll EKS clusters via the Access Management UI.

#### Improved SAML IdP configuration flow

When adding a SAML application via Access Management UI, users are now able to
configure attribute mapping and have Teleport fetch service provider's entity
descriptor automatically.

#### Improved provisioning for Okta

Teleport 15 improves performance of receiving user/group updates from Okta by
leveraging System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM).

Note: This feature will come out in a later 15.0 patch release.

#### Support for AWS KMS

Teleport 15 supports the use of AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to store and
handle the CA private key material used to sign all Teleport-issued
certificates. When enabled, private key material never leaves AWS KMS.

To migrate existing clusters to AWS KMS, you must perform a CA rotation.

#### MFA for administrative actions

When Teleport is configured to require webauthn (`second_factor: webauthn`),
administrative actions performed via `tctl` or the web UI will require an
additional MFA tap.

Examples of administrative actions include, but are not limited to:

- Resetting or recovering user accounts
- Inviting new users
- Updating cluster configuration resources
- Creating and approving access requests
- Generating new join tokens

Note: when MFA for administrative actions is enabled, user certificates produced
with `tctl auth sign` will no longer be suitable for automation due to the additional
MFA checks, unless run directly on a local Auth server (legacy setup). We
recommend using Machine ID to issue certificates for automated workflows, which
uses role impersonation that is not subject to MFA checks.

#### Teleport Connect improvements

Teleport Connect will now prompt for an MFA tap prior to accessing Kubernetes
clusters when per-session MFA is enabled.

Additionally, Teleport Connect includes support for TCP and web applications,
and can also launch AWS and SAML apps in a web browser.

#### Session playback improvements

Prior to Teleport 15, `tsh play` and the web UI would download the entire
session recording before starting playback. As a result, playback of large
recordings could be slow to start, and may fail to play at all in the browser.

In Teleport 15, session recordings are streamed from the auth server, allowing
playback to start before the entire session is downloaded and unpacked.

Additionally, `tsh play` now supports a `--speed` flag for adjusting the
playback speed, and desktop session playback now supports seeking to arbitrary
positions in the recording.

#### Web UI improvements

Prior to Teleport 15, there was a dropdown in the sidebar between “Resources”
and “Management,” and in the Resources mode, there were tabs in the sidebar for
Access Requests and Active Sessions. In Teleport 15, all of the above have moved
to tabs in a top navbar, and the Resources view is fully responsive across
viewport widths. A side navbar still exists in the “Access Management” tab.

Prior to Teleport 15, Passkeys and MFA devices were shown in a single list on
the “Account Settings” screen, without a clear distinction between them. In
Teleport 15, these have been split into distinct lists so it is clearer which
type of authentication you are adding to your account.

#### Standalone Kubernetes Operator

Prior to Teleport 15, the Teleport Kubernetes Operator had to run as a sidecar
of the Teleport auth. It was not possible to use the operator in Teleport Cloud
or against a Teleport cluster not deployed with the `teleport-cluster` Helm
chart.

In Teleport 15, the Teleport Operator can reconcile resources in any Teleport
cluster. Teleport Cloud users can now use the operator to manage their
resources.

When deployed with the `teleport-cluster` chart, the operator now runs in a
separate pod. This ensures that Teleport's availability won't be impacted if the
operator becomes unready.

See [the Standalone Operator
guide](docs/pages/management/dynamic-resources/teleport-operator-standalone.mdx)
for installation instructions.

#### Roles v6 and v7 support for Kubernetes Operator

Starting with Teleport 15, newly supported kinds will contain the resource
version. For example: `TeleportRoleV6` and `TeleportRoleV7` kinds will allow
users to create Teleport Roles v6 and v7.

Existing kinds will remain unchanged in Teleport 15, but will be renamed in
Teleport 16 for consistency.

To migrate an existing Custom Resource (CR) `TeleportRole` to a
`TeleportRoleV7`, you must:
- upgrade Teleport and the operator to v15
- annotate the exiting `TeleportRole` CR with `teleport.dev/keep: "true"`
- delete the `TeleportRole` CR (it won't delete the role in Teleport thanks to
  the annotation)
- create a new `TeleportRoleV7` CR with the same name

#### Enhanced ARM64 builds

Teleport 15 now provides FIPS-compliant Linux builds on ARM64. Users will now be
able to run Teleport in FedRAMP/FIPS mode on ARM64.

Additionally, Teleport 15 includes hardened AWS AMIs for ARM64.

### Breaking changes and deprecations

#### RDP engine requires RemoteFX

Teleport 15 includes a new RDP engine that leverages the RemoteFX codec for
improved performance. Additional configuration may be required to enable
RemoteFX on your Windows hosts.

If you are using our authentication package for local users, the v15 installer
will automatically enable RemoteFX for you.

Alternatively, you can enable RemoteFX by updating the registry:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services' -Name 'ColorDepth' -Type DWORD -Value 5
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services' -Name 'fEnableVirtualizedGraphics' -Type DWORD -Value 1
```

If you are using Teleport with Windows hosts that are part of an Active
Directory environment, you should enable RemoteFX via group policy.

Under Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components >
Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host, enable:

1. Remote Session Environment > RemoteFX for Windows Server 2008 R2 > Configure
   RemoteFX
1. Remote Session Environment > Enable RemoteFX encoding for RemoteFX clients
   designed for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
1. Remote Session Environment > Limit maximum color depth

Detailed instructions are available in the
[setup guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/active-directory.mdx#enable-remotefx).
A reboot may be required for these changes to take effect.

#### `tsh ssh`

When running a command on multiple nodes with `tsh ssh`, each line of output is
now labeled with the hostname of the node it was written by. Users that rely on
parsing the output from multiple nodes should pass the `--log-dir` flag to `tsh
ssh`, which will create a directory where the separated output of each node will
be written.

#### `drop` host user creation mode

The `drop` host user creation mode has been removed in Teleport 15. It is
replaced by `insecure-drop`, which still creates temporary users but does not
create a home directory. Users who need home directory creation should either
wrap `useradd`/`userdel` or use PAM.

#### Remove restricted sessions for SSH

The restricted session feature for SSH has been deprecated since Teleport 14 and
has been removed in Teleport 15. We recommend implementing network restrictions
outside of Teleport (iptables, security groups, etc).

#### Packages no longer published to legacy Debian and RPM repos

`deb.releases.teleport.dev` and `rpm.releases.teleport.dev` were deprecated in
Teleport 11. Beginning in Teleport 15, Debian and RPM packages will no longer be
published to these repos. Teleport 14 and prior packages will continue to be
published to these repos for the remainder of those releases' lifecycle.

All users are recommended to switch to `apt.releases.teleport.dev` and
`yum.releases.teleport.dev` repositories as described in installation
[instructions](docs/pages/installation.mdx).

The legacy package repos will be shut off in mid 2025 after Teleport 14 has been
out of support for many months.

#### Container images

Teleport 15 contains several breaking changes to improve the default security
and usability of Teleport-provided container images.

##### "Heavy" container images are discontinued

In order to increase default security in 15+, Teleport will no longer publish
[container images containing a shell and rich command line
environment](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/branch/v14/build.assets/charts/Dockerfile)
to Elastic Container Registry's
[gravitational/teleport](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport) image
repo. Instead, all users should use the [distroless
images](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/branch/v15/build.assets/charts/Dockerfile-distroless)
introduced in Teleport 12. These images can be found at:

* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless
* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-distroless

For users who need a shell in a Teleport container, a "debug" image is available
which contains BusyBox, including a shell and many CLI tools. Find the debug
images at:

* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug
* https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-distroless-debug

Do not run debug container images in production environments.

Heavy container images will continue to be published for Teleport 13 and 14
throughout the remainder of these releases' lifecycle.

##### Helm cluster chart FIPS mode changes

The teleport-cluster chart no longer uses versionOverride and extraArgs to set FIPS mode. 

Instead, you should use the following values file configuration:
```
enterpriseImage: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-fips-distroless
authentication:
  localAuth: false
```

##### Multi-architecture Teleport Operator images

Teleport Operator container images will no longer be published with architecture
suffixes in their tags (for example: `14.2.1-amd64` and `14.2.1-arm`). Instead,
only a single tag will be published with multi-platform support (e.g.,
`15.0.0`). If you use Teleport Operator images with an architecture suffix,
remove the suffix and your client should automatically pull the
platform-appropriate image. Individual architectures may be pulled with `docker
pull --platform <arch>`.

##### Quay.io registry

The quay.io container registry was deprecated and Teleport 12 is the last
version to publish images to quay.io. With Teleport 15's release, v12 is no
longer supported and no new container images will be published to quay.io.

For Teleport 8+, replacement container images can be found in [Teleport's public
ECR registry](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational).

Users who wish to continue to use unsupported container images prior to Teleport
8 will need to download any quay.io images they depend on and mirror them
elsewhere before July 2024. Following brownouts in May and June, Teleport will
disable pulls from all Teleport quay.io repositories on Wednesday July 3, 2024.

#### Amazon AMIs

Teleport 15 contains several breaking changes to improve the default security
and usability of Teleport-provided Amazon AMIs.

##### Hardened AMIs

Teleport-provided Amazon Linux 2023 previously only supported x86_64/amd64.
Starting with Teleport 15, arm64-based AMIs will be produced. However, the
naming scheme for these AMIs has been changed to include the architecture.

- Previous naming scheme: `teleport-oss-14.0.0-$TIMESTAMP`
- New naming scheme: `teleport-oss-15.0.0-x86_64-$TIMESTAMP`

##### Legacy Amazon Linux 2 AMIs

Teleport-provided Amazon Linux 2 AMIs were deprecated, and Teleport 14 is the
last version to produce such legacy AMIs. With Teleport 15's release, only the
newer hardened Amazon Linux 2023 AMIs will be produced.

The legacy AMIs will continue to be published for Teleport 13 and 14 throughout
the remainder of these releases' lifecycle.

#### `windows_desktop_service` no longer writes to the NTAuth store

In Teleport 15, the process that periodically publishes Teleport's user CA to
the Windows NTAuth store has been removed. It is not necessary for Teleport to
perform this step since it must be done by an administrator at installation
time. As a result, Teleport's service account can use more restrictive
permissions.

#### Example AWS cluster deployments updated

The AWS terraform examples for Teleport clusters have been updated to use the
newer hardened Amazon Linux 2023 AMIs. Additionally, the default architecture
and instance type has been changed to ARM64/Graviton.

As a result of this modernization, the legacy monitoring stack configuration
used with the legacy AMIs has been removed.

##### `teleport-cluster` Helm chart changes

Due to the new separate operator deployment, the operator is deployed by a
subchart. This causes the following breaking changes:
- `installCRDs` has been replaced by `operator.installCRDs`
- `teleportVersionOverride` does not set the operator version anymore, you must
  use `operator.teleportVersionOverride` to override the operator version.

Note: version overrides are dangerous and not recommended. Each chart version is
designed to run a specific Teleport and operator version. If you want to deploy
a specific Teleport version, use Helm's `--version X.Y.Z` instead.

The operator now joins using a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token. To validate the
token, the Teleport Auth Service must have access to the `TokenReview` API. The
chart configures this for you since v12, unless you disabled `rbac` creation.

##### Helm cluster chart FIPS mode changes

The teleport-cluster chart no longer uses versionOverride and extraArgs to set FIPS mode. 

Instead, you should use the following values file configuration:

```
enterpriseImage: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-ent-fips-distroless
authentication:
  localAuth: false

```

#### Resource version is now mandatory and immutable in the Terraform provider

Starting with Teleport 15, each Terraform resource must have its version
specified. Before version 15, Terraform was picking the latest version available
on resource creation. This caused inconsistencies as new resources creates with
the same manifest as old resources were not exhibiting the same behavior.

Resource version is now immutable. Changing a resource version will cause
Terraform to delete and re-create the resource. This ensures the correct
defaults are set.

Existing resources will continue to work as Terraform already imported their
version. However, new resources will require an explicit version.

### Other changes

#### Increased password length

The minimum password length for local users has been increased from 6 to 12
characters.

#### Increased account lockout interval

The account lockout interval has been increased from 20 to 30 minutes.

## 14.3.20 (05/23/24)

This release contains fixes for several high-severity security issues, as well
as numerous other bug fixes and improvements.

### Security Fixes

#### **[High]** Unrestricted redirect in SSO Authentication

Teleport didn’t sufficiently validate the client redirect URL. This could allow
an attacker to trick Teleport users into performing an SSO authentication and
redirect to an attacker-controlled URL allowing them to steal the credentials.
[#41834](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41834).

Warning: Teleport will now disallow non-localhost callback URLs for SSO logins
unless otherwise configured. Users of the `tsh login --callback` feature should
modify their auth connector configuration as follows:

```yaml
version: vX
kind: (saml|oidc|github)
metadata:
  name: ...
spec:
  ...
  client_redirect_settings:
    allowed_https_hostnames:
      - '*.app.github.dev'
      - '^\d+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.foo.internal$'
 ```

The `allowed_https_hostnames` field is an array containing allowed hostnames,
supporting glob matching and, if the string begins and ends with `^` and `$`
respectively, full regular expression syntax. Custom callback URLs are required
to be HTTPS on the standard port (443).

#### **[High]** CockroachDB authorization bypass

When connecting to CockroachDB using Database Access, Teleport did not properly
consider the username case when running RBAC checks. As such, it was possible to
establish a connection using an explicitly denied username when using a
different case. [#41823](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41823).

#### **[High]** Long-lived connection persistence issue with expired certificates

Teleport did not terminate some long-running mTLS-authenticated connections past
the expiry of client certificates for users with the `disconnect_expired_cert`
option. This could allow such users to perform some API actions after their
certificate has expired.
[#41827](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41827).

#### **[High]** PagerDuty integration privilege escalation

When creating a role access request, Teleport would include PagerDuty
annotations from the entire user’s role set rather than a specific role being
requested. For users who run multiple PagerDuty access plugins with
auto-approval, this could result in a request for a different role being
inadvertently auto-approved  than the one which corresponds to the user’s active
on-call schedule.
[#41837](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41837).

#### **[High]** SAML IdP session privilege escalation

When using Teleport as SAML IdP, authorization wasn’t properly enforced on the
SAML IdP session creation. As such, authenticated users could use an internal
API to escalate their own privileges by crafting a malicious program.
[#41846](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41846).

We strongly recommend all customers upgrade to the latest releases of Teleport.

* Fix broken finish web page for SSO user's on auto discover. [#41336](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41336)
* Add fallback on GetAccessList cache miss call. [#41327](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41327)
* Validate application URL extracted from the web application launcher request route. [#41305](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41305)
* Allow defining custom database names and users when selecting wildcard during test connection when enrolling a database through the web UI. [#41302](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41302)
* Updated Go to v1.21.10. [#41282](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41282)
* Forbid SSO users from local logins or password changes. [#41271](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41271)
* Prevents Cloud tenants from updating `cluster_networking_config` fields `keep_alive_count_max`,  `keep_alive_interval`, `tunnel_strategy`, or `proxy_listener_mode`. [#41248](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41248)

## 14.3.18 (05/07/24)

* Ensure that the active sessions page shows up in the web UI for users with permissions to join sessions. [#41222](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41222)

* Allows the listener for the tbot database-tunnel service to be set to a unix socket. [#41042](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41042)

## 14.3.17 (04/30/24)

* Fixed user SSO bypass by performing a local passwordless login. [#41071](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41071)
* Enforce allow_passwordless server-side. [#41058](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/41058)

## 14.1.3 (11/8/23)

### Security Fixes

#### [Medium] Arbitrary code execution with `LD_PRELOAD` and `SFTP`

Teleport implements SFTP using a subcommand. Prior to this release it was
possible to inject environment variables into the execution of this
subcommand, via shell init scripts or via the SSH environment request.

This is addressed by preventing `LD_PRELOAD` and other dangerous environment
variables from being forwarded during re-exec.

[#3274](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/34274)

#### [Medium] Outbound SSH from Proxy can lead to IP spoofing

If the Teleport auth or proxy services are configured to accept `PROXY`
protocol headers, a malicious actor can use this to spoof their IP address.

This is addressed by requiring that the first bytes of any SSH connection are
the SSH protocol prefix, denying a malicious actor the opportunity to send their
own proxy headers.

## 14.0.3 (10/11/23)

### Security Fixes

#### [Critical] Privilege escalation through `RecursiveChown`

When using automatic Linux user creation, an attacker could exploit a race
condition in the user creation functionality to `chown` arbitrary files on the

## 14.0.0 (09/20/23)

Teleport 14 brings the following new major features and improvements:

- Access lists
- Unified resource view
- ClickHouse support for database access
- Advanced audit log
- Kubernetes apps auto-discovery
- Extended Kubernetes per-resource RBAC
- Oracle database access audit logging support
- Enhanced PuTTY support
- Support for TLS routing in Terraform deployment examples
- Discord and ServiceNow hosted plugins
- Limited passwordless access for local Windows users in OSS Teleport
- Machine ID: Kubernetes Secret destination

In addition, this release includes several changes that affect existing
functionality listed in the “Breaking changes” section below. Users are advised
to review them before upgrading.

### New features

#### Advanced audit log

Teleport 14 includes support for a new audit log powered by Amazon S3 and Athena
that supports efficient searching, sorting, and filtering operations. Teleport
Cloud customers will have their audit log automatically migrated to this new
backend.

See the documentation [here](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx#athena).

#### Access lists

Teleport 14 introduces foundational support for access lists, an extension to
the short-lived access requests system targeted towards longer-term access.
Administrators can add users to access lists granting them long-term permissions
within the cluster.

As the feature is being developed, future Teleport releases will add support for
periodic audit reviews and deeper integration of access lists with Okta.

You can find existing access lists documentation [here](docs/pages/access-controls/access-lists/guide.mdx).

#### Unified resources view

The web UI in Teleport 14 has been updated to show all resources in a single
unified view.

This is the first step in a series of changes designed to support a
customizable Teleport experience and make it easier to access the resources that
are most important to you.

#### Kubernetes apps auto-discovery

Teleport 14 updates its auto-discovery capabilities with support for web
applications in Kubernetes clusters. When connected to a Kubernetes cluster (or
deployed as a Helm chart), Teleport discovery service will automatically find
and enroll web applications for use with app access.

See documentation [here](docs/pages/enroll-resources/auto-discovery/kubernetes-applications.mdx).

#### Extended Kubernetes per-resource RBAC

Teleport 14 extends resource-based access requests to support more Kubernetes
resources than just pods, including custom resources, and verbs. Note that this
feature requires role version `v7`.

See Kubernetes resources documentation to see a full list of [supported
resources](docs/pages/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx#kubernetes_resources).

#### ClickHouse support for database access

Teleport 14 adds database access support for ClickHouse HTTP and native (TCP)
protocols. When using HTTP protocol, the user's query activity is captured in
the Teleport audit log.

See how to connect ClickHouse to Teleport [here](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/clickhouse-self-hosted.mdx).

#### Oracle database access audit logging support

In Teleport 14, database access for Oracle integration is updated with query
audit logging support.

See documentation on how to configure it in the [Oracle guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/oracle-self-hosted.mdx).

#### Limited passwordless access for local Windows users in OSS Teleport

In Teleport 14, access to Windows desktops with local Windows users has been
extended to Community Edition. Teleport will permit users to register and
connect to up to 5 desktops with local users without an enterprise license.

For more information on using Teleport with local Windows users, see [docs](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx).

#### Discord and ServiceNow hosted plugins

Teleport 14 includes support for hosted Discord and ServiceNow plugins. Teleport
Cloud users can configure Discord and ServiceNow integrations to receive access
request notifications.

Discord plugin is available now, ServiceNow is coming in 14.0.1.

#### Enhanced PuTTY Support

tsh on Windows now supports the `tsh puttyconfig` command, which can easily
configure saved sessions inside the well-known PuTTY client to connect to
Teleport SSH services.

For more information, see [docs](docs/pages/connect-your-client/putty-winscp.mdx).

#### Support for TLS routing in Terraform deployment examples

The ha-autoscale-cluster and starter-cluster Terraform deployment examples now
support a `USE_TLS_ROUTING` variable to enable TLS routing inside the deployed
Teleport cluster.

#### Machine ID: Kubernetes Secret destination

In Teleport 14, `tbot` can now be configured to write artifacts such as
credentials and configuration files directly to a Kubernetes secret rather than
a directory on the local file system. This allows other services to more easily
consume the credentials output by `tbot` .

For more information, see [docs](docs/pages/enroll-resources/machine-id/reference/configuration.mdx#kubernetes_secret).

### Breaking changes and deprecations

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 14 before upgrading.

#### SSH node open dial no longer supported

Teleport 14 no longer allows connecting to OpenSSH servers not registered with
the cluster. Follow the updated agentless OpenSSH integration [guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh.mdx)
to register your OpenSSH nodes in the cluster’s inventory.

You can set `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_UNLISTED_AGENT_DIALING=yes` environment variable
on Teleport proxy to temporarily re-enable the open dial functionality. The
environment variable will be removed in Teleport 15.

#### Proxy protocol default change

Starting from version 14, Teleport will require users to explicitly enable or
disable PROXY protocol in their `proxy_service`/`auth_service` configuration
using `proxy_protocol: on|off` option.

Users who run their proxies behind L4 load balancers with PROXY protocol
enabled, should set `proxy_protocol: on`.  Users who don’t run Teleport behind
PROXY protocol enabled load balancers, should disable `proxy_protocol: off`
explicitly for security reasons.

By default, Teleport will accept the PROXY line but will prevent connections
with IP pinning enabled. IP pinning users will need to explicitly enable/disable
proxy protocol like explained above.

See more details in our [documentation](docs/pages/management/security/proxy-protocol.mdx).

#### Legacy deb/rpm package repositories are deprecated

Teleport 14 will be the last release published to the legacy package
repositories at `deb.releases.teleport.dev` and `rpm.releases.teleport.dev`.
Starting with Teleport 15, packages will only be published to the new
repositories at `apt.releases.teleport.dev` and `yum.releases.teleport.dev`.

All users are recommended to switch to `apt.releases.teleport.dev` and
`yum.releases.teleport.dev` repositories as described in installation
[instructions](docs/pages/installation.mdx).

#### `Cf-Access-Token` header no longer included with app access requests

Starting from Teleport 14, the `Cf-Access-Token` header containing the signed
JWT token will no longer be included by default with all app access requests.
All requests will still include `Teleport-JWT-Assertion` containing the JWT
token.

See documentation for details on how to inject the JWT token into any header
using [header rewriting](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/jwt/introduction.mdx#inject-jwt).

#### tsh db CLI commands changes

In Teleport 14 tsh db sub-commands will attempt to select a default value for
`--db-user` or `--db-name` flags if they are not provided by the user by
examining their allowed `db_users` and `db_names`.

The flags `--cert-file` and `--key-file` for tsh proxy db command were also
removed, in favor of the `--tunnel` flag that opens an authenticated local
database proxy.

#### MongoDB versions prior to 3.6 are no longer supported

Teleport 14 includes an update to the MongoDB driver.

Due to the MongoDB team dropping support for servers prior to version 3.6 (which
reached EOL on April 30, 2021), Teleport also will no longer be able to support
these old server versions.

#### Symlinks for `~/.tsh/environment` no longer supported

In order to strengthen the security in Teleport 14, file loading from home
directories where the path includes a symlink is no longer allowed.  The most
common use case for this is loading environment variables from the
`~/.tsh/environment` file.  This will still work normally as long as the path
includes no symlinks.

#### Deprecated audit event

Teleport 14 deprecates the `trusted_cluster_token.create` audit event, replacing
it with a new `join_token.create` event. The new event is emitted when any join
token is created, whether it be for trusted clusters or other Teleport services.

Teleport 14 will emit both events when a trusted cluster join token is created.
Starting in Teleport 15, the `trusted_cluster_token.create` event will no longer
be emitted.

### Other changes

#### DynamoDB billing mode defaults to on-demand

In Teleport 14, when creating new DynamoDB tables, Teleport will now create them
with the billing mode set to `pay_per_request` instead of being set to provisioned
mode.

The old behavior can be restored by setting the `billing_mode` option in the
storage configuration.

#### Default role version is v7

The default role version in Teleport 14 is `v7` which enables support for extended
Kubernetes per-resource RBAC, and changes the `kubernetes_resources` default to
wildcard for better getting started user experience.

You can review role versions in the [documentation](docs/pages/access-controls/reference.mdx#role-versions).

#### Stricter name validation for auto-discovered databases

In Teleport 14, database discovery via `db_service` config enforces the same name
validation as for databases created via tctl, static config, and
`discovery_service`.

As such, database names in AWS, GCP and Azure must start with a letter, contain
only letters, digits, and hyphens and end with a letter or digit (no trailing
hyphens).

#### Access Request API changes

Teleport 14 introduces a new and more secure API for submitting access requests.
As a result, tsh users may be prompted to upgrade their clients before
submitting an access request.

#### Desktop discovery name change

Desktops discovered via LDAP will have a short suffix appended to their name to
ensure uniqueness. Users will notice duplicate desktops (with and without the
suffix) for up to an hour after upgrading. Connectivity to desktops will not be
affected, and the old record will naturally expire after 1 hour.

#### Machine ID : New configuration schema

Teleport 14 introduces a new configuration schema (v2) for Machine ID’s agent
`tbot`.  The new schema is designed to be simpler, more explicit and more
extensible:

```yaml
version: v2
onboarding:
 token: gcp-bot
 join_method: gcp
storage:
 type: memory
auth_server: example.teleport.sh:443
outputs:
 - type: identity
   destination:
     type: kubernetes_secret
     name: my-secret
​
 - type: kubernetes
   kubernetes_cluster: my-cluster
   destination:
     type: directory
     path: ./k8s
​
 - type: database
   service: my-postgres-service
   database: postgres
   username: postgres
   destination:
     type: directory
     path: ./db
​
 - type: application
   app_name: my-app
   destination:
     type: directory
     path: ./app
```

`tbot` will continue to support the v1 schema for several Teleport versions but it
is recommended that you migrate to v2 as soon as possible to benefit from new
Machine ID features.

For more details and guidance on how to upgrade to v2, see [docs](docs/pages/enroll-resources/machine-id/reference/v14-upgrade-guide.mdx).

## 13.4.0 (09/20/23)

### Security Fixes

#### [Critical] Privilege escalation via host user creation

When using automatic Linux user creation, an attacker could exploit a race
condition in the user creation functionality to create arbitrary files on the
system as root writable by the created user.

This could allow the attacker to escalate their privileges to root.

Users who aren't using automatic Linux host user creation aren’t affected by
this vulnerability.

[#32210](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/32210)

#### [High] Insufficient auth token verification when signing self-hosted database certificates

When signing self-hosted database certificates, Teleport did not sufficiently
validate the authorization token type.

This could allow an attacker to sign valid database access certificates using a
guessed authorization token name.

Users who aren’t using self-hosted database access aren’t affected by this
vulnerability.

[#32215](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/32215)

#### [High] Privilege escalation via untrusted config file on Windows

When loading the global tsh configuration file tsh.yaml on Windows, Teleport
would look for the file in a potentially untrusted directory.

This could allow a malicious user to create harmful command aliases for all tsh
users on the system.

Users who aren’t using tsh on Windows aren’t affected by this vulnerability.

[#32223](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/32223)

#### [High] XSS in SAML IdP

When registering a service provider with SAML IdP, Teleport did not sufficiently
validate the ACS endpoint.

This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code at the client-side
leading to privilege escalation.

This issue only affects Teleport Enterprise Edition. Enterprise users who aren’t
using Teleport SAML IdP functionality aren’t affected by this vulnerability.

### Breaking Changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 13 before upgrading.

#### Teleport Kubernetes Agent helm chart

When upgrading to Teleport 13, users of the Teleport Kubernetes Agent Helm chart
that manually create their own Teleport token secret (`secretName=<secretName>` and no auth token provided)
will need to set the following values:

```yaml
# Manages the join token secret creation and its name.
joinTokenSecret:
  # create controls whether the Helm chart should create and manage the join token
  # secret.
  # If false, the chart assumes that the secret with the configured name already exists at the
  # installation namespace.
  create: false
  # Name of the Secret to store the teleport join token.
  name: <secretName>
```

The Helm chart parameter `secretName` was deprecated in Teleport 13 in favor of
`joinTokenSecret.name`. `joinTokenSecret.create` indicates whether the Helm
chart should create and manage the join token secret. If `create` is set to
`false`, the chart assumes that the secret with the configured name already
exists at the installation namespace.

## 13.0.0 (05/08/23)

Teleport 13 brings the following marquee features and improvements:

* (Preview) Automatic agent upgrades.
* (Preview) TLS routing through ALB for Server, Kubernetes and Application Access.
* (Preview, Enterprise-only) Ability to import applications and groups from Okta to Application Access.
* (Preview) AWS OpenSearch support for Database Access.
* (Preview) View and control access to OpenSSH nodes natively in Teleport.
* Cross-cluster search for Teleport Connect.
* Kubernetes Access performance improvements.
* Universal binaries (including Apple Silicon) for macOS.
* Simplified RDS onboarding flow in Access Management UI.
* Light theme for Web UI.

### (Preview) Automatic agent upgrades

In Teleport 13 users can configure their Teleport agents deployed via apt/yum
repositories or a Helm chart to be upgraded automatically.

### (Preview) TLS routing through ALB for Server, Kubernetes and Application Access

Teleport 13 adds single-port TLS routing mode support to Server, Kubernetes and
Application Access for clusters deployed behind application layer load balancers
such as AWS ALB.

### (Preview, Enterprise-only) Ability to import applications and groups from Okta to Application Access

In Teleport 13  users can import apps and groups from Okta and use Teleport
access requests for requesting short-term access to them. This feature is only
available in the Teleport Enterprise edition.

### (Preview) AWS OpenSearch support for Database Access

Database Access users can now connect to AWS OpenSearch databases.

### (Preview) View and control access to OpenSSH nodes natively in Teleport

In Teleport 13 users will be able register OpenSSH nodes as a resource with the
cluster.

This will allow users to view the OpenSSH nodes in Web UI and using `tsh ls`
and use RBAC to control access to them.

See the updated [OpenSSH integration
guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh.mdx).

### Cross-cluster search for Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect now includes a new search experience, allowing you to search
for and connect to resources across all logged-in clusters.

### Kubernetes Access performance improvements

In Teleport 13 we improved the way Teleport Proxy handles Kubernetes Access
credentials.

Users will experience better performance when interacting with Kubernetes
clusters using kubectl or via the API.

### Universal binaries (including Apple Silicon) for macOS

Teleport 13 binaries (including Teleport Connect) will have universal
architecture and run natively on both Intel and ARM macOS systems.

### Simplified RDS onboarding flow in Access Management UI

When connecting an RDS database using Teleport 13 Access Management UI, users
can connect their AWS account and select the RDS database to add instead of
entering details manually.

To try out the new flow, add an RDS database using the Resource Management UI
in your cluster’s Web UI dashboard.

### Light theme for Web UI

Teleport's web UI includes an optional light theme.

The light theme is enabled by default but can be changed back to the dark theme
via the top-right corner user settings menu.

### Desktop Access recording export

Session recordings for Windows desktop sessions can now be exported to video
format for offline playback with the new tsh recordings export command.

### SFTP in Moderated Sessions

Teleport 13 adds the ability to transfer files in Moderated Sessions.
This feature requires that both the session originator and the moderator
have joined the session via the web UI.

### Breaking changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes
in Teleport 13 before upgrading.

#### Default session join mode

Teleport 13 defaults to observer (read-only) mode when joining SSH and Kubernetes
sessions. Prior versions of Teleport would default to peer mode for SSH sessions
and moderator mode for Kubernetes sessions. To override the default join mode,
specify the --mode flag with tsh join.

#### CA rotation deprecation

Teleport 13 removes support for rotating all certificate authorities with
`tctl auth rotate --type=all`. The `type` flag is now required, which ensures
that only one CA is rotated at a time, increasing cluster stability during
rotations.

#### Join token API changes

The default 30-minute expiry no longer applies to tokens created via YAML
resource files. If you want to enforce an expiration, ensure this is set in the
`metadata.expires` field. Tokens created using `tctl nodes add` and `tctl tokens add`
will continue to have a default 30m expiry applied.

Additionally, users of Teleport’s API module will note that the `CreateToken`
and `UpsertToken` RPCs are now deprecated in favor of `CreateTokenV2` and
`UpsertTokenV2`. The new V2 variants no longer have a default expiry, so be sure
to set a TTL if you want your tokens to expire.

The original RPCs are still supported in Teleport 13 and will be removed
completely for Teleport 14.

#### Enhanced user validation

Teleport 13 will refuse to create or update users that reference non-existent
roles. In some circumstances, older versions of Teleport would permit you to
create users and assign them invalid roles. In Teleport 13 this is a hard error.

#### Quay.io registry

Quay.io registry was deprecated in Teleport 11 and starting with Teleport 13,
Teleport container images are no longer being published to it.

Users should use the [public ECR
registry](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational).

#### Helm chart uses `distroless`-based container image by default

Starting with Teleport 13, the Helm charts `teleport-cluster` and `teleport-kube-agent`
are deploying distroless Teleport images by default. Those images are slimmer
and more secure but contain less tooling (e.g. neither `bash` nor
`apt` are available).

The Debian-based images are deprecated and will be removed in Teleport 14.
The chart image can be reverted back to the Debian-based images by setting:
```yaml
image: "public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport"
```

For debugging purposes, a "debug" image is available and contains BusyBox,
which includes a shell and most common POSIX executables:
`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug`.

## 12.1.5 (03/30/23)

This release of Teleport contains 2 security fixes as well as multiple improvements and bug fixes.

### [High] OS authorization bypass in SSH tunneling

When establishing an SSH port forwarding connection, Teleport did not
sufficiently validate the specified OS principal.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid cluster credentials to
establish a TCP tunnel to a node using a non-existent Linux user.

The connection attempt would show up in the audit log as a "port" audit event
(code T3003I) and include Teleport username in the "user" field.

### [High] Teleport authorization bypass in Kubernetes Access

When authorizing a Kubernetes access request, Teleport did not adequately
validate the target Kubernetes cluster.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid Kubernetes agent credentials
or a join token to trick Teleport into forwarding requests to a different
Kubernetes cluster.

Every Kubernetes request would show up in the audit log as a "kube.request"
audit event (code T3009I) and include the Kubernetes cluster metadata.

## 12.0.1

Teleport 12 brings the following marquee features and improvements:

- Device Trust (Preview, Enterprise only)
- Passwordless Windows access for local users (Preview, Enterprise only)
- Per-pod RBAC for Kubernetes access (Preview)
- Azure and GCP CLI support for application access (Preview)
- Support for more databases in database access:
  - AWS DynamoDB
  - AWS Redshift Serverless
  - AWS RDS Proxy for PostgreSQL/MySQL
  - Azure SQLServer Auto Discovery
  - Azure Flexible Servers
- Refactored Helm charts (Preview)
- Dropped support for SHA1 in Server Access
- Signed/notarized macOS binaries

### Device Trust (Preview, Enterprise only)

Teleport 12 includes a preview of our upcoming Device Trust feature, which
allows administrators to require that Teleport access is performed from an
authenticated and trusted device.

This preview release requires macOS and a native client like tsh or Teleport
Connect. These clients leverage the Secure Enclave on macOS to solve device
challenges issued by the Teleport CA, proving their identity as a trusted
device.

Teleport features requiring the web UI (desktop access, application access) are
not currently supported.

### Passwordless Windows Access for Local Users (Preview, Enterprise only)

Teleport 12 brings passwordless certificate-based authentication to Windows
desktops in environments where Active Directory is not available. This feature
requires the installation of a Teleport package on each Windows desktop.

### Per-pod RBAC for Kubernetes access (Preview)

Teleport 12 extends RBAC to support controlling access to individual pods in
Kubernetes clusters. Pod RBAC integrates with existing Teleport RBAC features
such as role templating and access requests.

### Azure and GCP CLI support for application access (Preview)

In Teleport 12 administrators can interact with Azure and GCP APIs through the
Application Service using `tsh az` and `tsh gcloud` CLI commands, or using
standard `az` and `gcloud` tools through the local application proxy.

### Support for more databases in Database Access

Database access in Teleport 12 brings a number of new integrations to AWS-hosted
databases such as DynamoDB (now with audit log support), Redshift Serverless and
RDS Proxy for PostgreSQL/MySQL.

On Azure, database access adds SQLServer auto-discovery and support for Azure
Flexible Server for PostgreSQL/MySQL.

### Refactored Helm charts (Preview)

The “teleport-cluster” Helm chart underwent significant refactoring in Teleport
12 to provide better scalability and UX. Proxy and Auth are now separate
deployments and the new “scratch” chart mode makes it easier to provide a custom
Teleport config.

“Custom” mode users should follow the [migration
guide](./docs/pages/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/migration-v12.mdx).

### Dropped support for SHA1 in Server Access

Newer OpenSSH clients connecting to Teleport 12 clusters no longer need the
“PubAcceptedKeyTypes” workaround to include the deprecated “sha” algorithm.

### Signed/notarized macOS binaries

Users who download Teleport 12 Darwin binaries would no longer get an untrusted
software warning from macOS.

### tctl edit

tctl now supports an edit subcommand, allowing you to edit resources directly in
your preferred text editor.

### Breaking Changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 12 before upgrading.

#### Helm charts

The teleport-cluster Helm chart underwent significant changes in Teleport 12. To
upgrade from an older version of the Helm chart deployed in “custom” mode,
follow
the [migration guide](./docs/pages/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/migration-v12.mdx).

Additionally, PSPs are removed from the chart when installing on Kubernetes 1.23
and higher to account for the deprecation/removal of PSPs by Kubernetes.

#### tctl auth export

The tctl auth export command only exports the private key when passing the
--keys flag. Previously it would output the certificate and private key
together.

#### Desktop Access

Windows Desktop sessions disable the wallpaper by default, improving
performance. To restore the previous behavior, add `show_desktop_wallpaper: true`
to your windows_desktop_service config.

### Secure certificate mapping for Desktop Access

Later this year, Windows will begin requiring a stronger mapping from a certificate
to an Active Directory user. In anticipation of this change, Teleport 11.2.0 is compliant
with the new requirements.

*Warning:* This feature requires that Teleport's own service account also uses a strong
mapping. In order to support this requirement, you must now set a new Security Identifier
(`sid`) field in the LDAP configuration for your Windows Desktop Services. You can find
the SID for your service account by running the following PowerShell snippet
(replace `svc-teleport` with the name of the service account you are using):

```
Get-AdUser -Identity svc-teleport | Select SID
```

## 11.1.4

This release of Teleport contains multiple security fixes, improvements and bug fixes.

*Note:* This release of Teleport contains an issue that affects backwards compatibility
with database access agents. If you are a database access user we recommend skipping
straight to version 11.2.0.

### [Critical] RBAC bypass in SSH TCP tunneling

When establishing a direct-tcpip channel, Teleport did not sufficiently validate
RBAC.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid cluster credentials to
establish a TCP tunnel to a node they didn’t have access to.

The connection attempt would show up in the audit log as a “port” audit event
(code T3003I) and include Teleport username in the “user” field.

### [High] Application access session hijack

When accepting application access requests, Teleport did not sufficiently
validate client credentials.

This could allow an attacker in possession of a valid active application session
ID to issue requests to this application impersonating the session owner for a
limited time window.

Presence of multiple “cert.create” audit events (code TC000I) with the same app
session ID in the “route_to_app.session_id” field may indicate the attempt to
impersonate an existing user’s application session.

### [Medium] SSH IP pinning bypass

When issuing a user certificate, Teleport did not check for the presence of IP
restrictions in the client’s credentials.

This could allow an attacker in possession of valid client credentials with IP
restrictions to reissue credentials without IP restrictions.

Presence of a “cert.create” audit event (code TC000I) without corresponding
“user.login” audit event (codes T1000I or T1101I) for users with IP restricted
roles may indicate an issuance of a certificate without IP restrictions.

### [Low] Web API session caching

After logging out via the web UI, a user’s session could remain cached in
Teleport’s proxy, allowing continued access to resources for a limited time
window.

## 11.0.0

Teleport 11 brings the following new major features and improvements:

- Hardware-backed private keys support for server access (Enterprise only).
- Replacement of obsolete SCP protocol with SFTP for server access.
- Removal of persistent storage requirement for Helm charts.
- Automatic discovery and enrollment of EKS/AKS clusters for Kubernetes access.
- Richer Azure integrations for server and database access.
- Cassandra and Scylla support for database access, including AWS Keyspaces.
- GitHub Actions and Terraform support for Machine ID.
- Access Requests and file upload/download support for Teleport Connect.

### Hardware-backed private keys (Enterprise Only)

Teleport 11 clients (such as tsh or Connect) support storing their private key
material on Yubikey devices instead of filesystem which helps prevent
credentials exfiltration attacks.

See how to enable it in the
[documentation](./docs/pages/access-controls/guides/hardware-key-support.mdx):

Hardware-backed private keys is an enterprise only feature, and is currently
supported for server access only.

### SFTP protocol

Teleport 11 adds server-side support for SFTP protocol which many IDEs such as
VSCode or JetBrains PyCharm, GoLand and others use for browsing, copying, and
editing files on remote systems.

The following guides explain how to use IDEs to connect to a remote machine via
Teleport:

- [VS Code](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/guides/vscode.mdx)
- [JetBrains](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/guides/jetbrains-sftp.mdx)

In addition, Teleport 11 clients will use SFTP protocol for file transfer under
the hood instead of the obsolete scp protocol. Server-side scp is still
supported so existing clients aren’t affected.

### Helm charts persistent storage

In Teleport 11 users no longer need to use persistent storage when deploying
Helm charts. When running on Kubernetes, Teleport services will now store their
identities in Kubernetes Secrets which removes the need for using persistent
storage or static join tokens.

For existing deployments, this change involves migration from Deployment to
StatefulSet which is performed automatically during Helm upgrade to Teleport 11.

### EKS/AKS discovery

Teleport 11 adds support for automatic discovery and enrollment of AWS Elastic
Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

### Azure integrations

Teleport 11 improves Azure support in multiple areas.

Teleport agents running on Azure VMs will now automatically import Azure tags to
label resources.

Teleport database access now supports auto-discovery for Azure-hosted PostgreSQL
and MySQL databases. See the [Azure
guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-azure-databases/azure-postgres-mysql.mdx) for more
details.

In addition, Teleport database access will now use Azure AD managed identity
authentication for Azure-hosted SQL Server databases.

### Cassandra/ScyllaDB

Teleport 11 adds support for Cassandra and ScyllaDB databases in Database
Access. This includes support for AWS Keyspaces.

### Machine ID

Teleport 11 adds support for secret-less joining of Machine ID agents in GitHub
Actions workflows. See the guide for more details: TODO

We have also released a GitHub Action for setting up the Teleport binaries
within a GitHub workflow environment. More details regarding this can be found
at the Teleport GitHub Actions repository:

https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-actions

In addition, the Teleport Terraform plugin now supports the creation of Machine
ID Bots and Bot Tokens.

### tsh MFA on Windows

tsh 11 adds support for MFA and passwordless logins via Windows Hello and
FIDO2 devices.

### Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect has added support for Access Requests and file upload/download.

### Breaking Changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 11 before upgrading.

#### Removed Github external SSO

Beginning in Teleport 11, GitHub SAML SSO will only be available in our
Enterprise Edition. GitHub SSO without SAML will continue to work with OSS
Teleport.

To keep using GitHub SSO with the OSS Teleport, SAML SSO needs to be disabled
for your GitHub organization. OSS Teleport users can continue to use GitHub SSO
if using a Github Free or Team GitHub Plan.

#### Changed Terraform OIDC connector redirect_url type to array

In Teleport Plugins 11, `redirect_url` property in OIDC connectors created via
a Terraform module expects an array:

```
redirect_url = [ "http://example.com" ]
```

#### Deprecated Quay.io registry

Starting with Teleport 11, Quay.io as a container registry has been deprecated.
Customers should use the new AWS ECR registry to pull [Teleport Docker
images](./docs/pages/installation.mdx#docker).

Quay.io registry support will be removed in a future release.

#### Deprecated old deb/rpm repositories

In Teleport 11, old deb/rpm repositories (deb.releases.teleport.dev and
rpm.releases.teleport.dev) have been deprecated. Customers should use the new
repositories (apt.releases.teleport.dev and yum.releases.teleport.dev) to
[install Teleport](docs/pages/installation.mdx#linux).

Support for our old deb/rpm repositories will be removed in a future release.

#### Changed teleport-kube-agent Helm chart to StatefulSet

Teleport 11 agents will now store their identities in Kubernetes Secrets when
deployed via a Helm chart which eliminates the need for using persistent storage
or static join tokens. Due to this change, Teleport agents are now always
deployed as part of StatefulSet regardless of whether persistent storage is
enabled or not.

Existing agents that were deployed as Kubernetes Deployments (i.e. without
persistent storage) will be automatically converted to StatefulSets during
Teleport 11 Helm upgrade.

#### Removed PostgreSQL backend

The preview PostgreSQL backend was deleted due to performance and scalability
concerns.

#### Removed desktop access support for 32-bit ARM and 386 architectures

32-bit support for desktop access on ARM and 386 architectures has been removed
due to performance issues on these devices.

This also reduces the binary size for these builds, making them slightly more
convenient for smaller resource-constrained devices.

## 10.0.0

Teleport 10 is a major release that brings the following new features.

Platform:

* Passwordless (Preview)
* Resource Access Requests (Preview)
* Proxy Peering (Preview)

Server access:

* IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)
* Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)

Database access:

* Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server database access
* Snowflake database access (Preview)
* ElastiCache/MemoryDB database access (Preview)

Teleport Connect:

* Teleport Connect for server and database access (Preview)

Machine ID:

* Machine ID database access support (Preview)

### Passwordless (Preview)

Teleport 10 introduces passwordless support to your clusters. To use passwordless
users may register a security key with resident credentials or use a built-in
authenticator, like Touch ID.

See the [documentation](./docs/pages/access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx).

### Resource Access Requests (Preview)

Teleport 10 expands just-in-time access requests to allow for requesting access
to specific resources. This lets you grant users the least privileged access
needed for their workflows.

Just-in-time access requests are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### Proxy Peering (Preview)

Proxy peering enables Teleport deployments to scale without an increase in load
from the number of agent connections. This is accomplished by allowing Proxy
Services to tunnel client connections to the desired agent through a neighboring
proxy and decoupling the number of agent connections from the number of Proxies.

Proxy peering can be enabled with the following configurations:

```yaml
auth_service:
  tunnel_strategy:
    type: proxy_peering
    agent_connection_count: 1
```

```yaml
proxy_service:
  peer_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3021
```

Network connectivity between proxy servers to the `peer_listen_addr` is required
for this feature to work.

Proxy peering is only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)

Teleport 10 introduces a new role option to pin the source IP in SSH
certificates. When enabled, the source IP that was used to request certificates
is embedded in the certificate, and SSH servers will reject connection attempts
from other IPs. This protects against attacks where valid credentials are
exfiltrated from disk and copied out into other environments.

IP-based restrictions are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.

### Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)

Teleport 10 can be configured to automatically create Linux host users upon
login without having to use Teleport's PAM integration. Users can be added to specific
Linux groups and assigned appropriate “sudoer” privileges.

To learn more about configuring automatic user provisioning read the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/guides/host-user-creation.mdx).

### Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server database access

Teleport 9 introduced a preview of database access support for Microsoft SQL
Server which didn’t include audit logging of user queries. Teleport 10 captures
users' queries and prepared statements and sends them to the audit log, similarly
to other supported database protocols.

Teleport database access for SQL Server remains in Preview mode with more UX
improvements coming in future releases.

Refer to [the guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/sql-server-ad.mdx) to set
up access to a SQL Server with Active Directory authentication.

### Snowflake database access (Preview)

Teleport 10 brings support for Snowflake to database access. Administrators can
set up access to Snowflake databases through Teleport for their users with
standard database access features like role-based access control and audit
logging, including query activity.

Connect your Snowflake database to Teleport following the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-managed-databases/snowflake.mdx).

### Elasticache/MemoryDB database access (Preview)

Teleport 9 added Redis protocol support to database access. Teleport 10 improves
this integration by adding native support for AWS-hosted Elasticache and
MemoryDB, including auto-discovery and automatic credential management in some
deployment configurations.

Learn more about it in the [documentation](
docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/redis-aws.mdx).

### Teleport Connect for server and database access (Preview)

Teleport Connect is a graphical macOS application that simplifies access to your
Teleport resources. Teleport Connect 10 supports server access and database access.
Other protocols and Windows support are coming in a future release.

Get Teleport Connect installer from the macOS tab on the downloads page:
https://goteleport.com/download/.

### Machine ID database access support (Preview)

In Teleport 10 we’ve added database access support to Machine ID. Applications
can use Machine ID to access databases protected by Teleport.

You can find Machine ID guide for database access in the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/machine-id/access-guides/databases.mdx).

### Breaking changes

Please familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in
Teleport 10 before upgrading.

#### Auth Service version check

Teleport 10 agents will now refuse to start if they detect that the Auth Service
is more than one major version behind them. You can use the `--skip-version-check` flag to
bypass the version check.

Take a look at component compatibility guarantees in the
[documentation](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

#### HTTP_PROXY for reverse tunnels

Reverse tunnel connections will now respect `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables.
This may result in reverse tunnel agents not being able to re-establish
connections if the HTTP proxy is set in their environment and does not allow
connections to the Teleport Proxy Service.

Refer to the
[documentation](docs/pages/reference/networking.mdx#http-connect-proxies)
for more details.

#### New APT repos

With Teleport 10 we’ve migrated to new APT repositories that now support
multiple release channels, Teleport versions and OS distributions. The new
repositories have been backfilled with Teleport versions starting from 6.2.31
and we recommend upgrading to them. The old repositories will be maintained for
the foreseeable future.

See the [installation
instructions](docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/getting-started.mdx#step-14-install-teleport-on-your-linux-host).

#### Removed “tctl access ls”

The `tctl access ls` command that returned information about user server access
within the cluster was removed. Please use a previous `tctl` version if you’d like
to keep using it.

#### Relaxed session join permissions

In previous versions of Teleport users needed full access to a Node/Kubernetes
pod in order to join a session. Teleport 10 relaxes this requirement. Joining
sessions remains deny-by-default but now only `join_sessions` statements are
checked for session join RBAC.

See the [Moderated Sessions
guide](docs/pages/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx) for more
details.

#### GitHub connectors

The GitHub authentication connector’s `teams_to_logins` field is deprecated in favor of the new
`teams_to_roles` field. The old field will be removed in a future release.

#### Teleport FIPS AWS endpoints

Teleport 10 will now automatically use FIPS endpoints for AWS S3 and DynamoDB
when started with the `--fips` flag. You can use the `use_fips_endpoint=false`
connection endpoint option to use regular endpoints for Teleport in FIPS mode,
for example:

```
s3://bucket/path?region=us-east-1&use_fips_endpoint=false
```

See the [S3/DynamoDB backend
documentation](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx) for more information.

## 9.3.9

This release of Teleport contains a security fix, as well as multiple improvements and bug fixes.

### Auth bypass in Moderated Sessions

## 9.3.4

This release of Teleport contains multiple security, bug fixes and improvements.

### Escalation attack in agent forwarding

When setting up agent forwarding on the node, Teleport did not handle unix socket creation in a secure manner.

This could have given a potential attacker an opportunity to get Teleport to change arbitrary file permissions to the attacker’s user.

### WebSockets CSRF

When handling websocket requests, Teleport did not verify that the provided Bearer token was generated for the correct user.

This could have allowed a malicious low privileged Teleport user to use a social engineering attack to gain higher privileged access on the same Teleport cluster.

### Denial of service in access requests

When accepting an access request, Teleport did not enforce the maximum request reason size.

This could allow a malicious actor to mount a DoS attack by creating an access request with a very large request reason.

### Auth bypass in moderated sessions

When initializing a moderated session, Teleport did not discard participant’s input prior to the moderator joining.

This could prevent a moderator from being able to interrupt a malicious command executed by a participant.

### Other fixes

* Fixed issue with stdin hijacking when per-session MFA is enabled. [#13212](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13212)
* Added support for automatic tags import when running on AWS EC2. [#12593](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12593)
* Added ability to use multiple redirect URLs in OIDC connectors. [#13046](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13046)
* Fixed issue with ANSI escape sequences being broken when using `tsh` on Windows. [#13221](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13221)
* Fixed issue with `tsh ssh` printing extra error upon exit if last command was unsuccessful. [#12903](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12903)
* Added support for Proxy Protocol v2 in MySQL proxy. [#12993](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12993)
* Upgraded to Go `v1.17.11`. [#13104](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13104)
* Added Windows desktops labeling based on their LDAP attributes. [#13238](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13238)
* Improved performance when listing resources for users with many roles. [#13263](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13263)

## 9.3.2

This release of Teleport contains two bug fixes.

* Fixed issue with Machine ID's `tsh` version check. [#13037](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13037)
* Fixed AWS related log spam in database agent when not running on AWS. [#12984](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12984)

## 9.3.0

This release of Teleport contains multiple improvements and bug fixes.

* Fixed issue with `tctl` not taking `TELEPORT_HOME` environment variable into account. [#12738](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12738)
* Fixed issue with Redis `AUTH` command not always authenticating the user in database access. [#12754](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12754)

* Fixed issue with `teleport configure` failing when given non-existent data directory. [#12806](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12806)
* Fixed issue with `tctl` not outputting debug logs. [#12920](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12920)
* Fixed issue with Kubernetes access not working when using default CA pool. [#12874](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12874)
* Fixed issue with Machine ID not working in TLS routing mode. [#12990](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12990)
* Improved connection performance in large clusters. [#12832](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12832)
* Improved memory usage in large clusters. [#12724](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12724)

### Breaking Changes

Teleport 9.3.0 reduces the minimum GLIBC requirement to 2.18 and enforces more
secure cipher suites for desktop access.

As a result of these changes, desktop access users with desktops running Windows
Server 2012R2 will need to perform [additional
configuration](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx) to force Windows
to use compatible cipher suites.

Windows desktops running Windows Server 2016 and newer will continue to operate
normally - no additional configuration is required.

## 9.2.4

## 9.1.0

Teleport 9.1 is a minor release that brings several new features, security and bug fixes.

### Security

Teleport build infrastructure was updated to use Go v1.17.9 to fix CVE-2022-24675, CVE-2022-28327 and CVE-2022-27536.

### SQL backend (preview)

Teleport users can now use PostgreSQL or CockroachDB for storing auth server data.

See the [documentation](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx) for more information.

### Server-side filtering and pagination

Searching and filtering resources is now handled on the server, improving the
efficiency of queries with `tsh`, `tctl`, or the web UI.

The web UI loads resources faster by leveraging server-side pagination.
Additionally, the web UI supports bookmarking searches by including the query in
the URL.

## 9.0.0

Teleport 9.0 is a major release that brings:

- Teleport desktop access GA
- Teleport Machine ID Preview
- Various additions to Teleport database access
- Moderated Sessions for server and Kubernetes access

Desktop access adds support for clipboard sharing, session recording, and
per-session MFA.

Teleport Machine ID Preview extends identity-based access to machines. It's the
easiest way to issue, renew, and manage SSH and X.509 certificates for service
accounts, microservices, CI/CD automation and all other forms of
machine-to-machine access.

Database access brings self-hosted Redis support, RDS MariaDB (10.6 and higher)
support, auto-discovery for Redshift clusters, and auto-IAM configuration
improvements to GA. Additionally, this release also brings Microsoft SQL Server
with AD authentication to Preview.

Moderated Sessions enables the creation of sessions where a moderator has to
be present. This feature can be selectively enabled for specific sessions via
RBAC and can be used in conjunction with per-session MFA.

### Desktop access

#### Clipboard Support

Desktop access now supports copying and pasting text between your local
workstation and a remote Windows Desktop. This feature requires a Chromium-based
browser and can be disabled via RBAC.

#### Session Recording

Desktop sessions are now recorded and stored alongside SSH sessions, and can be
viewed in Teleport's web interface. Desktop session recordings are fully
compatible with the RBAC for sessions feature introduced in Teleport 8.1.

#### Per-session MFA

Per-session MFA settings now apply to desktop sessions. This allows cluster
administrators to require an additional MFA "tap" prior to opening a desktop
session. This feature requires a WebAuthn device.

### Machine ID (Preview)

Machine ID allows the creation of machine / bot / service account users who can
automatically issue, renew, and manage SSH and X.509 certificates to facilitate
machine-to-machine access.

Machine ID is a service that programmatically issues and renews short-lived
certificates to any service account (e.g., a CI/CD server) by retrieving
credentials from the Teleport Auth Service. This enables fine-grained role-based
access controls and audit.

Some of the things you can do with Machine ID:

- Machines can retrieve short-lived SSH certificates for CI/CD pipelines.
- Machines can retrieve short-lived X.509 certificates for use with databases or
  applications.
- Configure role-based access controls and locking for machines.
- Capture access events in the audit log.

[Machine ID getting started guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/machine-id/getting-started.mdx)

### Database access

#### Redis

You can now use database access to connect to a self-hosted Redis instance or
Redis cluster and view Redis commands in the Teleport audit log. We will be
adding support for AWS Elasticache in the coming weeks.

[Self-hosted Redis
guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/redis.mdx)

#### SQL Server (Preview)

Teleport 9 includes a preview release of Microsoft SQL Server with Active
Directory authentication support for database access. Audit logging of query
activity is not included in the preview release and will be implemented in a
later 9.x release.

[SQL Server guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/sql-server-ad.mdx)

#### RDS MariaDB

Teleport 9 updates MariaDB support with auto-discovery and connection to AWS RDS
MariaDB databases using IAM authentication. The minimum MariaDB version that
supports IAM authentication is 10.6.

[Updated RDS guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx)

#### Other Improvements

In addition, Teleport 9 expands auto-discovery to support Redshift databases and
2 new commands which simplify the database access getting started experience:
"teleport db configure create", which generates Database Service configuration,
and "teleport db configure bootstrap", which configures IAM permissions for the
Database Service when running on AWS.

CLI commands reference:
- [`teleport db configure
  create`](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/reference/cli.mdx#teleport-db-configure-create)
- [`teleport db configure bootstrap`](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/reference/cli.mdx#teleport-db-configure-bootstrap)

### Moderated Sessions

With Moderated Sessions, Teleport administrators can define policies that allow
users to invite other users to participate in SSH or Kubernetes sessions as
observers, moderators or peers.

[Moderated Sessions guide](docs/pages/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx)

### Breaking Changes

#### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 support was deprecated in Teleport 8 and has now been removed.

#### Desktop access

Desktop access now authenticates to LDAP using X.509 client certificates.
Support for the `password_file` configuration option has been removed.

## 8.0.0 

Teleport 8.0 is a major release of Teleport that contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### Windows desktop access Preview

Teleport 8.0 includes a preview of the Windows desktop access feature, allowing
users passwordless login to Windows Desktops via any modern web browser.

Teleport users can connect to Active Directory enrolled Windows hosts running
Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2 and newer Windows versions.

To try this feature yourself, check out our
[Getting Started Guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/desktop-access/getting-started.mdx).

Review the desktop access design in:

- [RFD #33](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0033-desktop-access.md)
- [RFD #34](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0034-desktop-access-windows.md)
- [RFD #35](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0035-desktop-access-windows-authn.md)
- [RFD #37](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0037-desktop-access-protocol.md)

#### TLS Routing

In TLS routing mode all client connections are wrapped in TLS and multiplexed on
a single Teleport proxy port.

TLS routing can be enabled by including the following auth service configuration:

```yaml
auth_service:
  proxy_listener_mode: multiplex
  ...
```

and setting proxy configuration version to `v2` to prevent legacy listeners from
being created:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_service:
  ...
```

#### AWS CLI

Teleport application access extends AWS console support to CLI . Users are able
to log into their AWS console using `tsh apps login` and use `tsh aws` commands
to interact with AWS APIs.

See more info in the
[documentation](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console.mdx).

#### Application and Database Dynamic Registration

With dynamic registration users are able to manage applications and databases
without needing to update static YAML configuration or restart application or
database agents.

See dynamic registration guides for
[apps](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx)
and
[databases](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx).

#### RDS Automatic Discovery

With RDS auto discovery Teleport database agents can automatically discover RDS
instances and Aurora clusters in an AWS account.

See updated
[RDS guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx) for
more information.

#### WebAuthn

WebAuthn support enables Teleport users to use modern second factor options,
including Apple FaceID and TouchID.

In addition, the Teleport Web UI includes new second factor management tools,
enabling users to configure and update their second factor devices via their
web browser.

Lastly, our UI becomes more secure by requiring an additional second factor
confirmation for certain privileged actions (editing roles for second factor
confirmation, for example).

### Improvements

* Added support for [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com) to Database
  Access. [#8505](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8505)
* Reduced network utilization on large clusters during login.
  [#8471](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8471)
* Added metrics and added the ability for `tctl top` to show network utilization
  for resource propagation.
  [#8338](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8338)
  [#8603](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8603)
  [#8491](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8491)
* Added support for account recovery and cancellation.
  [#6769](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6769)
* Added per-session MFA support to database access.
  [#8270](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8270)
* Added support for profile specific `kubeconfig`.
  [#7840](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7840)

### Fixes

* Fixed issues with web applications that utilized
  [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource)
  with application access.
  [#8359](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8359)
* Fixed issue were interactive sessions would always return exit code 0.
  [#8081](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8081)
* Fixed issue where JWT signer was omitted from bootstrap logic.
  [#8119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/8119)

### Breaking Changes

#### CentOS 6

CentOS 6 support will be deprecated in Teleport 8 and removed in Teleport 9.

Teleport 8 will continue to receive security patches for about 9 months after
which it will be EOL. Users are encouraged to upgrade to CentOS 7 in that time
frame.

#### Updated  dependencies

New run time dependencies have been added to Teleport 8 due to the inclusion of
Rust in the build chain. Teleport 8 requires `libgcc_s.so` and `libm.so` be
installed on systems running Teleport.

Users of [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
container images are encouraged to use the
[gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/blob/main/examples/rust/Dockerfile)
image to run Teleport.

```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian11
```

Alpine users are recommended to install the `libgcc` package in addition to any
glibc compatibility layer they have already been using.

```
apk --update --no-cache add libgcc
```

#### Database access Certificates

With the `GODEBUG=x509ignoreCN=0` flag removed in Go 1.17, database access users
will no longer be able to connect to databases that include their hostname in
the `CommonName` field of the presented certificate. Users are recommended to
update their database certificates to include hostname in the
`Subject Alternative Name` extension instead.

Subscribe to Github issue
[#7636](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/7636) which will add
ability to control level of TLS verification as a workaround.

#### Role Changes

New clusters will no longer have the default `admin` role, it has been replaced
with 3 smaller scoped roles: `access`, `auditor`, and `editor`.

## 7.0.0

Teleport 7.0 is a major release of Teleport that contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### New Features

#### MongoDB

Added support for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) to Teleport database access. [#6600](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6600).

#### Cloud SQL MySQL

Added support for [GCP Cloud SQL MySQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql) to Teleport database access. [#7302](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7302)

View the Cloud SQL MySQL [guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-google-cloud-databases/mysql-cloudsql.mdx) for more details.

#### AWS Console

Added support for [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console) to Teleport application access. [#7590](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7590)

Teleport application access can now automatically sign users into the AWS Management Console using [Identity federation](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation). View AWS Management Console [guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console.mdx) for more details.

#### Restricted Sessions

Added the ability to block network traffic (IPv4 and IPv6) on a per-SSH session basis. Implemented using BPF tooling which required kernel 5.8 or above. [#7099](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7099)

#### Enhanced Session Recording

Updated Enhanced Session Recording to no longer require the installation of external compilers like `bcc-tools`. Implemented using BPF tooling which required kernel 5.8 or above. [#6027](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6027)

### Improvements

* Added the ability to terminate database access certificates when the certificate expires. [#5476](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5476)
* Added additional FedRAMP compliance controls, such as custom disconnect and MOTD messages. [#6091](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6091) [#7396](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7396)
* Added the ability to export Audit Log and session recordings using the Teleport API. [#6731](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6731) [#7360](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7360)
* Added the ability to partially configure a cluster. [#5857](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5857) [RFD #28](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0028-cluster-config-resources.md)
* Added the ability to disable port forwarding on a per-host basis. [#6989](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6989)
* Added ability to configure `tsh` home directory. [#7035](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7035/files)
* Added ability to generate OpenSSH client configuration snippets using `tsh config`. [#7437](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7437)
* Added default-port detection to `tsh` [#6374](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6374)
* Improved performance of the Web UI for users with many roles. [#7588](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7588)

### Fixes

* Fixed a memory leak that could affect etcd users. [#7631](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7631)
* Fixed an issue where `tsh login` could fail if the user had multiple public addresses defined on the proxy. [#7368](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/7368)

### Breaking Changes

#### Enhanced Session Recording

Enhanced Session Recording has been updated to use CO-RE BPF executables. This makes deployment much simpler, you no longer have to install `bcc-tools`, but comes with a higher minimum kernel version of 5.8 and above. [#6027](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6027)

#### Kubernetes access

Kubernetes access will no longer automatically register a cluster named after the Teleport cluster if the proxy is running within a Kubernetes cluster. Users wishing to retain this functionality now have to explicitly set `kube_cluster_name`. [#6786](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6786)

#### `tsh`

`tsh login` has been updated to no longer change the current Kubernetes context. While `tsh login` will write credentials to `kubeconfig` it will only update your context if `tsh login --kube-cluster` or `tsh kube login <kubeCluster>` is used. [#6045](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/6045)

## 6.2.0 

Teleport 6.2 contains new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

**Note:** the DynamoDB indexing change described below may cause rate-limiting
errors from AWS APIs and is slow on large deployments (1000+ existing audit
events). The next patch release, v6.2.1, will improve the migration performance.
If you run a large DynamoDB-based cluster, we advise you to wait for v6.2.1
before upgrading.

### New Features

#### Added Amazon Redshift Support

Added support for [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift) to Teleport database access.[#6479](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6479).

View the [database access with Redshift on AWS guide](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/postgres-redshift.mdx) for more details.

### Improvements

* Added pass-through header support for Teleport application access. [#6601](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6601)
* Added ability to propagate claim information from root to leaf clusters. [#6540](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6540)
* Added Proxy Protocol for MySQL database access. [#6594](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6594)
* Added prepared statement support for Postgres database access. [#6303](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6303)
* Added `GetSessionEventsRequest` RPC endpoint for Audit Log pagination. [RFD 19](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0019-event-iteration-api.md) [#6731](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6731)
* Changed DynamoDB indexing strategy for events. [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583)

### Fixes

* Fixed multiple per-session MFA issues. [#6542](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6542) [#6567](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6567) [#6625](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6625) [#6779](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6779) [#6948](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6948)
* Fixed etcd JWT renewal issue. [#6905](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6905)
* Fixed issue where `kubectl exec` sessions were not being recorded when the target pod was killed. [#6068](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6068)
* Fixed an issue that prevented Teleport from starting on ARMv7 systems. [#6711](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6711).
* Fixed issue that caused Access Requests to inconsistently allow elevated Kubernetes access. [#6492](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6492)
* Fixed an issue that could cause `session.end` events not to be emitted. [#6756](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6756)
* Fixed an issue with PAM variable interpolation. [#6558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6558)

### Breaking Changes

#### Agent Forwarding

Teleport 6.2 brings a potentially backward incompatible change with `tsh` agent forwarding.

Prior to Teleport 6.2, `tsh ssh -A` would create an in-memory SSH agent from your `~/.tsh` directory and forward that agent to the target host.

Starting in Teleport 6.2 `tsh ssh -A` by default now forwards your system SSH agent (available at `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`). Users wishing to retain the prior behavior can use `tsh ssh -o "ForwardAgent local"`.

For more details see [RFD 22](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0022-ssh-agent-forwarding.md) and implementation in [#6525](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6525).

#### DynamoDB Indexing Change

DynamoDB users should note that the events backend indexing strategy has
changed and a data migration will be triggered after upgrade. For optimal
performance perform this migration with only one auth server online. It may
take some time and progress will be periodically written to the auth server
log. During this migration, only events that have been migrated will appear in
the Web UI. After completion, all events will be available.

For more details see [RFD 24](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0024-dynamo-event-overflow.md) and implementation in [#6583](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/6583).

### New Features

#### U2F for Kubernetes and SSH sessions

Added support for U2F authentication on every SSH and Kubernetes "connection" (a single `tsh ssh` or `kubectl` call). This is an advanced security feature that protects users against compromises of their on-disk Teleport certificates. Per-session MFA can be enforced cluster-wide or only for some specific roles.

For more details see [Per-Session
MFA](docs/pages/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa.mdx) documentation or
[RFD
14](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0014-session-2FA.md)
and [RFD
15](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0015-2fa-management.md)

## 6.0.0

Teleport 6.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes.

We have implemented [database access](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx),
open sourced role-based access control (RBAC), and added official API and a Go client library.

Users can review the [6.0 milestone](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/33?closed=1) on Github for more details.

### New Features

#### Database access

Review the database access design in [RFD #11](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0011-database-access.md).

With database access users can connect to PostgreSQL and MySQL databases using short-lived certificates, configure SSO authentication and role-based access controls for databases, and capture SQL query activity in the audit log.

##### Getting Started

Configure database access following the [Getting Started](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/getting-started.mdx/) guide.

##### Guides

* [AWS RDS/Aurora
  PostgreSQL](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx)
* [AWS RDS/Aurora MySQL](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx)
* [Self-hosted PostgreSQL](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/postgres-self-hosted.mdx)
* [Self-hosted MySQL](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-self-hosted-databases/mysql-self-hosted.mdx)
* [GUI clients](docs/pages/connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx)

##### Resources

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for database access, check out the [RBAC](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx) section.

[Architecture](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx) provides a more in-depth look at database access internals such as networking and security.

See [Reference](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/reference.mdx) for an overview of database access related configuration and CLI commands.

Finally, check out [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/pages/enroll-resources/database-access/faq.mdx).

#### OSS RBAC

Open source RBAC support was introduced in [RFD #7](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0007-rbac-oss.md).

RBAC support gives OSS administrators more granular access controls to servers and other resources with a cluster (like session recording access). An example of an RBAC policy could be: "admins can do anything, developers must never touch production servers and interns can only SSH into staging servers as guests"

In addition, some Access Workflow Plugins will now become available to open source users.

* Access Workflows Golang SDK and API
* Slack
* Gitlab
* Mattermost
* JIRA Plugin
* PagerDuty Plugin

#### Client libraries and API

API and Client Libraries support was introduced in [RFD #10](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0010-api.md).

The new API and client library reduces the dependencies needed to use the Teleport API as well as making it easier to use. An example of using the new API is below.

```go
// Create a client connected to the Auth server with an exported identity file.
clt, err := client.NewClient(client.Config{
  Addrs: []string{"auth.example.com:3025"},
  Credentials: []client.Credentials{
    client.LoadIdentityFile("identity.pem"),
  },
})
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v.", err)
}
defer clt.Close()

// Create a Access Request.
accessRequest, err := types.NewAccessRequest(uuid.New(), "access-admin", "admin")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to build access request: %v.", err)
}
if err = clt.CreateAccessRequest(ctx, accessRequest); err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("Failed to create access request: %v.", err)
}
```

### Improvements

* Added `utmp`/`wtmp` support for SSH in [#5491](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5491).
* Added the ability to set a Kubernetes specific public address in [#5611](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5611).
* Added Proxy Protocol support to Kubernetes access in [#5299](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5299).
* Added ACME ([Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)) support to make getting and using TLS certificates easier. [#5177](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5177).
* Added the ability to manage local users to the Web UI in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Added the ability to preserve timestamps when using `tsh scp` in [#2889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2889).

### Fixes

* Fixed authentication failure when logging in via CLI with Access Workflows after removing `.tsh` directory in [#5323](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5323).
* Fixed `tsh login` failure when `--proxy` differs from actual proxy public address in [#5380](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5380).
* Fixed session playback issues in [#2945](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2945).
* Fixed several UX issues in [#5559](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5559), [#5568](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/5568), [#4965](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4965), and [#5057](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5057).

### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](./docs/pages/management/admin.mdx) to upgrade your cluster.

Note, for clusters using GitHub SSO and Trusted Clusters, when upgrading SSO users will lose connectivity to leaf clusters. Local users will not be affected.

To restore connectivity to leaf clusters for SSO users, leaf admins should update the `trusted_cluster` role mapping resource like below.

```yaml
kind: trusted_cluster
version: v2
metadata:
   name: "zztop-oss"
spec:
   enabled: true
   token: "bar"
   web_proxy_addr: 172.10.1.1:3080
   tunnel_addr: 172.10.1.1:3024
   role_map:
   - remote: "admin"
     local: ['admin']
   - remote: "^(github-.*)$"
     local: ['admin']
```

## 5.1.0

This release of Teleport adds a new feature.

* Support for creating and assuming Access Workflow requests from within the Web UI (first step toward full Workflow UI support: [#4937](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4937)).

## 5.0.2

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5119](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5119).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 5.0.2 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.


## 5.0.1

This release of Teleport contains multiple bug fixes.

* Always set expiry times on server resource in heartbeats [#5008](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5008)
* Fixes streaming k8s responses (`kubectl logs -f`, `kubectl run -it`, etc) [#5009](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5009)
* Multiple fixes for the k8s forwarder [#5038](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5038)

## 5.0.0 

Teleport 5.0 is a major release with new features, functionality, and bug fixes. Users can review [5.0 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/39?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

### New Features

Teleport 5.0 introduces two distinct features: Teleport application access and significant Kubernetes access improvements - multi-cluster support.

#### Teleport application access

Teleport can now be used to provide secure access to web applications. This new feature was built with the express intention of securing internal apps which might have once lived on a VPN or had a simple authorization and authentication mechanism with little to no audit trail. application access works with everything from dashboards to single page Javascript applications (SPA).

Application access uses mutually authenticated reverse tunnels to establish a secure connection with the Teleport unified Access Platform which can then becomes the single ingress point for all traffic to an internal application.

Adding an application follows the same UX as adding SSH servers or Kubernetes clusters, starting with creating a static or dynamic invite token.

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=app
```

Then simply start Teleport with a few new flags.

```sh
$ teleport start --roles=app --token=xyz --auth-server=proxy.example.com:3080 \
    --app-name="example-app" \
    --app-uri="http://localhost:8080"
```

This command will start an app server that proxies the application "example-app" running at `http://localhost:8080` at the public address `https://example-app.example.com`.

Applications can also be configured using the new `app_service` section in `teleport.yaml`.

```yaml
app_service:
   # Teleport application access is enabled.
   enabled: yes
   # We've added a default sample app that will check
   # that Teleport application access is working
   # and output JWT tokens.
   # https://dumper.teleport.example.com:3080/
   debug_app: true
   apps:
   # application access can be used to proxy any HTTP endpoint.
   # Note: Name can't include any spaces and should be DNS-compatible A-Za-z0-9-._
   - name: "internal-dashboard"
     uri: "http://10.0.1.27:8000"
     # By default Teleport will make this application
     # available on a sub-domain of your Teleport proxy's hostname
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # - thus the importance of setting up wildcard DNS.
     # If you want, it's possible to set up a custom public url.
     # DNS records should point to the proxy server.
     # internal-dashboard.teleport.example.com
     # Example Public URL for the internal-dashboard app.
     # public_addr: "internal-dashboard.acme.com"
     # Optional labels
     # Labels can be combined with RBAC rules to provide access.
     labels:
       customer: "acme"
       env: "production"
     # Optional dynamic labels
     commands:
     - name: "os"
       command: ["/usr/bin/uname"]
       period: "5s"
     # A proxy can support multiple applications. application access
     # can also be deployed with a Teleport node.
     - name: "arris"
       uri: "http://localhost:3001"
       public_addr: "arris.example.com"
```

Application access requires two additional changes. DNS must be updated to point the application domain to the proxy and the proxy must be loaded with a TLS certificate for the domain. Wildcard DNS and TLS certificates can be used to simplify deployment.

```yaml
# When adding the app_service certificates are required to provide a TLS
# connection. The certificates are managed by the proxy_service
proxy_service:
  # We've extended support for https certs. Teleport can now load multiple
  # TLS certificates. In the below example we've obtained a wildcard cert
  # that'll be used for proxying the applications.
  # The correct certificate is selected based on the hostname in the HTTPS
  # request using SNI.
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
  - key_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/privkey.pem
    cert_file: /etc/letsencrypt/live/*.teleport.example.com/fullchain.pem
```

You can learn more in the [Application Access introduction](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/application-access/introduction.mdx).

#### Teleport Kubernetes access

Teleport 5.0 also introduces two highly requested features for Kubernetes.

* The ability to connect multiple Kubernetes Clusters to the Teleport Access Platform, greatly reducing operational complexity.
* Complete Kubernetes audit log capture [#4526](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4526), going beyond the existing `kubectl exec` capture.

For a full overview please review the [Kubernetes RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0005-kubernetes-service.md).

To support these changes, we've introduced a new service. This moves Teleport Kubernetes configuration from the `proxy_service` into its own dedicated `kubernetes_service` section.

When adding the new Kubernetes service, a new type of join token is required.

```bash
tctl tokens add --type=kube
```

Example configuration for the new `kubernetes_service`:

```yaml
# ...
kubernetes_service:
   enabled: yes
   listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3027
   kubeconfig_file: /secrets/kubeconfig
```

Note: a Kubernetes port still needs to be configured in the `proxy_service` via `kube_listen_addr`.

#### New "tsh kube" commands

`tsh kube` commands are used to query registered clusters and switch `kubeconfig` context:

```sh
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=awly

# list all registered clusters
$ tsh kube ls
Cluster Name       Status
-------------      ------
a.k8s.example.com  online
b.k8s.example.com  online
c.k8s.example.com  online

# on login, kubeconfig is pointed at the first cluster (alphabetically)
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com

# but all clusters are populated as contexts
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME                     CLUSTER             AUTHINFO
*         proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-a.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-b.k8s.example.com
          proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com   proxy.example.com   proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# switch between different clusters:
$ tsh kube login c.k8s.example.com

# the traditional way is also supported:
$ kubectl config use-context proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com

# check current cluster
$ kubectl config current-context
proxy.example.com-c.k8s.example.com
```

Other Kubernetes changes:

* Support k8s clusters behind firewall/NAT using a single Teleport cluster [#3667](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3667)
* Support multiple k8s clusters with a single Teleport proxy instance [#3952](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3952)

##### Additional User and Token Resource

We've added two new RBAC resources; these provide the ability to limit token creation and to list and modify Teleport users:

```yaml
- resources: [user]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
- resources: [token]
  verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
```

Learn more about [Teleport's RBAC Resources](./docs/pages/access-controls/introduction.mdx)

##### Cluster Labels

Teleport 5.0 also adds the ability to set labels on Trusted Clusters. The labels are set when creating a trusted cluster invite token. This lets teams use the same RBAC controls used on nodes to approve or deny access to clusters. This can be especially useful for MSPs that connect hundreds of customers' clusters - when combined with Access Workflows, cluster access can easily be delegated. Learn more by reviewing our [Truster Cluster Setup & RBAC Docs](./docs/pages/management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx)

Creating a trusted cluster join token for a production environment:

```bash
$ tctl tokens add --type=trusted_cluster --labels=env=prod
```

```yaml
kind: role
#...
  deny:
    # cluster labels control what clusters user can connect to. The wildcard ('*')
    # means any cluster. By default, deny rules are empty to preserve backwards
    # compatibility
    cluster_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

##### Teleport UI Updates

Teleport 5.0 also iterates on the UI Refresh from 4.3. We've moved the cluster list into our sidebar and have added an Application launcher. For customers moving from 4.4 to 5.0, you'll notice that we have moved session recordings back to their own dedicated section.

Other updates:

* We now provide local user management via `https://[cluster-url]/web/users`, providing the ability to easily edit, reset and delete local users.
* Teleport Node & App Install scripts. This is currently an Enterprise-only feature that provides customers with an easy 'auto-magic' installer script. Enterprise customers can enable this feature by modifying the 'token' resource. See note above.
* We've added a Waiting Room for customers using Access Workflows. [Docs](docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins.mdx)

##### Signed RPM and Releases

Starting with Teleport 5.0, we now provide an RPM repo for stable releases of Teleport. We've also started signing our RPMs to provide assurance that you're always using an official build of Teleport.

See https://rpm.releases.teleport.dev/ for more details.

#### Improvements

* Added `--format=json` playback option for `tsh play`. For example `tsh play --format=json ~/play/0c0b81ed-91a9-4a2a-8d7c-7495891a6ca0.tar | jq '.event` can be used to show all events within an a local archive. [#4578](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4578)
* Added support for continuous backups and auto scaling for DynamoDB. [#4780](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4780)
* Added a Linux ARM64/ARMv8 (64-bit) Release. [#3383](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3383)
* Added `https_keypairs` field which replaces `https_key_file` and `https_cert_file`. This allows administrators to load multiple HTTPS certs for Teleport application access. Teleport 5.0 is backwards compatible with the old format, but we recommend updating your configuration to use `https_keypairs`.

Enterprise Only:

* `tctl` can load credentials from `~/.tsh` [#4678](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4678)
* Teams can require a user submitted reason when using Access Workflows [#4573](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4573#issuecomment-720777443)

#### Fixes

* Updated `tctl` to always format resources as lists in JSON/YAML. [#4281](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4281)
* Updated `tsh status` to now print Kubernetes status. [#4348](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4348)
* Fixed intermittent issues with `loginuid.so`. [#3245](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3245)
* Reduced `access denied to Proxy` log spam. [#2920](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/2920)
* Various AMI fixes: paths are now consistent with other Teleport packages and configuration files will not be overwritten on reboot.

#### Documentation

We've added an [API Guide](docs/pages/api/introduction.mdx) to simply developing applications against Teleport.

#### Upgrade Notes

Please follow our [standard upgrade procedure](./docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

* Optional: Consider updating `https_key_file` & `https_cert_file` to our new `https_keypairs:` format.
* Optional: Consider migrating Kubernetes access from `proxy_service` to `kubernetes_service` after the upgrade.

## 4.4.6 

This release of teleport contains a security fix and a bug fix.

* Patch a SAML authentication bypass (see https://github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2/security/advisories/GHSA-xhqq-x44f-9fgg): [#5120](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5120).

Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta, Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.4.6 and restart Teleport. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest disabling SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

* Fix an issue where `tsh login` would fail with an `AccessDenied` error if
the user was perviously logged into a leaf cluster. [#5105](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/5105)

## 4.4.5 

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where a slow or unresponsive Teleport auth service could hang client connections in async recording mode. [#4696](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/4696)

## 4.4.4 

This release of Teleport adds enhancements to the Access Workflows API.

* Support for creating limited roles that trigger access requests
on login, allowing users to be configured such that no nodes can
be accessed without externally granted roles.

* Teleport UI support for automatically generating access requests and
assuming new roles upon approval (access requests were previously
only available in `tsh`).

* New `claims_to_roles` mapping that can use claims from external
identity providers to determine which roles a user can request.

* Various minor API improvements to help make requests easier to
manage and audit, including support for human-readable
request/approve/deny reasons and structured annotations.

## 4.4.2 

This release of Teleport adds support for a new build architecture.

* Added automatic arm64 builds of Teleport to the download portal.

## 4.4.1 

This release of Teleport contains a bug fix.

* Fixed an issue where defining multiple logging configurations would cause Teleport to crash. [#4598](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/4598)

## 4.4.0 

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.4 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/40?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

### New Features

#### Concurrent Session Control

This addition to Teleport helps customers obtain AC-10 control. We now provide two new optional configuration values: `max_connections` and `max_sessions`.

###### `max_connections`

This value is the total number of concurrent sessions within a cluster to nodes running Teleport. This value is applied at a per user level. If you set `max_connections` to `1`, a `tsh` user would only be able to `tsh ssh` into one node at a time.

###### `max_sessions` per connection

This value limits the total number of session channels which can be established across a single SSH connection (typically used for interactive terminals or remote exec operations). This is for cases where nodes have Teleport set up, but a user is using OpenSSH to connect to them. It is essentially equivalent to the `MaxSessions` configuration value accepted by `sshd`.

```yaml
spec:
  options:
    # Optional: Required to be set for AC-10 Compliance
    max_connections: 2
    # Optional: To match OpenSSH behavior set to 10
    max_sessions: 10
```

###### `session_control_timeout`

A new `session_control_timeout` configuration value has been added to the `auth_service` configuration block of the Teleport config file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.

```yaml
auth_service:
  session_control_timeout: 2m # default
# ...
```

#### Session Streaming Improvements

Teleport 4.4 includes a complete refactoring of our event system. This resolved a few customer bug reports such as [#3800: Events overwritten in DynamoDB](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3800) and [#3182: Teleport consuming all disk space with multipart uploads](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3182).

Along with foundational improvements, 4.4 includes two new experimental `session_recording` options: `node-sync` and `proxy-sync`.
NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.

```yaml
# This section configures the 'auth service':
auth_service:
    # Optional setting for configuring session recording. Possible values are:
    #     "node"  : sessions will be recorded on the node level (the default)
    #     "proxy" : recording on the proxy level, see "recording proxy mode" section.
    #     "off"   : session recording is turned off
    #
    #     EXPERIMENTAL *-sync modes: proxy and node send logs directly to S3 or other
    #     storage without storing the records on disk at all. This mode will kill a
    #     connection if network connectivity is lost.
    #     NOTE: These experimental modes require all Teleport auth servers, proxy servers and
    #     nodes to be running Teleport 4.4.
    #
    #     "node-sync" : sessions recording will be streamed from node -> auth -> storage
    #     "proxy-sync : sessions recording will be streamed from proxy -> auth -> storage
    #
    session_recording: "node-sync"
```

## 4.3.0

This is a major Teleport release with a focus on new features, functionality, and bug fixes. It’s a substantial release and users can review [4.3 closed issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/milestone/37?closed=1) on Github for details of all items.

#### New Features

##### Web UI

Teleport 4.3 includes a completely redesigned Web UI. The new Web UI expands the management functionality of a Teleport cluster and the user experience of using Teleport to make it easier and simpler to use. Teleport's new terminal provides a quick jumping-off point to access nodes and nodes on other clusters via the web.

Teleport's Web UI now exposes Teleport’s Audit log, letting auditors and administrators view Teleport access events, SSH events, recording session, and enhanced session recording all in one view.

##### Teleport Plugins

Teleport 4.3 introduces four new plugins that work out of the box with [Approval Workflow](docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins.mdx). These plugins allow you to automatically support role escalation with commonly used third party services. The built-in plugins are listed below.

*   [PagerDuty](./docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-pagerduty.mdx)
*   [Jira](./docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-jira.mdx)
*   [Slack](./docs/pages/access-controls/access-request-plugins/ssh-approval-slack.mdx)

*   Fixed Vulnerabilities in Teleport Docker Image [https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport?tab=tags](https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport?tab=tags)

#### Upgrade Notes

Always follow the [recommended upgrade
procedure](./docs/pages/upgrading.mdx) to upgrade to this version.

##### New Signing Algorithm

If you’re upgrading an existing version of Teleport, you may want to consider rotating CA to SHA-256 or SHA-512 for RSA SSH certificate signatures. The previous default was SHA-1, which is now considered to be weak against brute-force attacks. SHA-1 certificate signatures are also [no longer accepted](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html) by OpenSSH versions 8.2 and above. All new Teleport clusters will default to SHA-512 based signatures. To upgrade an existing cluster, set the following in your `teleport.yaml`:

```
teleport:
    ca_signature_algo: "rsa-sha2-512"
```

Rotate the cluster CA, following [these
docs](docs/pages/management/operations/ca-rotation.mdx).

##### Web UI

Due to the number of changes included in the redesigned Web UI, some URLs and functionality have shifted. Refer to the following ticket for more details. [#3580](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/3580)

##### RBAC for Audit Log and Recorded Sessions

Teleport 4.3 has made the audit log accessible via the Web UI. Enterprise customers
can limit access by changing the options on the new `event` resource.

```yaml
# list and read audit log, including audit events and recorded sessions
- resources: [event]
  verbs: [list, read]
```

##### Kubernetes Permissions

The minimum set of Kubernetes permissions that need to be granted to Teleport
proxies has been updated. If you use the Kubernetes integration, please make
sure that the ClusterRole used by the proxy has [sufficient
permissions](./docs/pages/enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx).

##### Path prefix for etcd

The [etcd backend](docs/pages/reference/backends.mdx#etcd) now correctly uses
the “prefix” config value when storing data. Upgrading from 4.2 to 4.3 will
migrate the data as needed at startup. Make sure you follow our Teleport
[upgrade guidance](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

**Note: If you use an etcd backend with a non-default prefix and need to downgrade from 4.3 to 4.2, you should [backup Teleport data and restore it](docs/pages/management/operations/backup-restore.mdx) into the downgraded cluster.**

## 4.2.12

This release of Teleport contains a security fix.

* Mitigated [CVE-2020-15216](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15216) by updating github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig.

### Details
A vulnerability was discovered in the `github.com/russellhaering/goxmldsig` library which is used by Teleport to validate the
signatures of XML files used to configure SAML 2.0 connectors. With a carefully crafted XML file, an attacker can completely
bypass XML signature validation and pass off an altered file as a signed one.

### Actions
The `goxmldsig` library has been updated upstream and Teleport 4.2.12 includes the fix. Any Enterprise SSO users using Okta,
Active Directory, OneLogin or custom SAML connectors should upgrade their auth servers to version 4.2.12 and restart Teleport.

If you are unable to upgrade immediately, we suggest deleting SAML connectors for all clusters until the updates can be applied.

## 4.2.7

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

## 4.0.16 

As part of a routine security audit of Teleport, a security vulnerability was discovered that affects all recent releases of Teleport. We strongly suggest upgrading to the latest patched release to mitigate this vulnerability.

### Details

Due to a flaw in how the Teleport Web UI handled host certificate validation, host certificate validation was disabled for clusters where connections were terminated at the node. This means that an attacker could impersonate a Teleport node without detection when connecting through the Web UI.

Clusters where sessions were terminated at the proxy (recording proxy mode) are not affected.

Command line programs like `tsh` (or `ssh`) are not affected by this vulnerability.

### Actions

To mitigate this issue, upgrade and restart all Teleport proxy processes.

## 4.0.0

This is a major Teleport release which introduces support for Teleport Internet of Things (IoT). In addition to this new feature this release includes usability, performance, and bug fixes listed below.

### New Features

#### Teleport for IoT

With Teleport 4.0, nodes gain the ability to use reverse tunnels to dial back to a Teleport cluster to bypass firewall restrictions. This allows connections even to nodes that a cluster does not have direct network access to. Customers that have been using Trusted Clusters to achieve this can now utilize a unified interface to access all nodes within their infrastructure.

#### FedRamp Compliance

With this release of Teleport, we have built out the foundation to help Teleport Enterprise customers build and meet the requirements in a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP). This includes a FIPS 140-2 friendly build of Teleport Enterprise as well as a variety of improvements to aid in complying with security controls even in FedRAMP High environments.

### Improvements

* Teleport now support 10,000 remote connections to a single Teleport cluster. [Using our recommend hardware setup.](./docs/pages/management/operations/scaling.mdx#hardware-recommendations)
* Added ability to delete node using `tctl rm`. [#2685](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2685)
* Output of `tsh ls` is now sorted by node name. [#2534](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2534)

### Bug Fixes

* Switched to `xdg-open` to open a browser window on Linux. [#2536](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2536)
* Increased SSO callback timeout to 180 seconds. [#2533](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2533)
* Set permissions on TTY similar to OpenSSH. [#2508](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/2508)

The lists of improvements and bug fixes above mention only the significant changes, please take a look at the complete list on Github for more.

### Upgrading

Teleport 4.0 is backwards compatible with Teleport 3.2 and later. [Follow the recommended upgrade procedure to upgrade to this version.](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx)

Note that due to substantial changes between Teleport 3.2 and 4.0, we recommend creating a backup of the backend datastore (DynamoDB, etcd, or dir) before upgrading a cluster to Teleport 4.0 to allow downgrades.

#### Notes on compatibility

Teleport has always validated host certificates when a client connects to a server, however prior to Teleport 4.0, Teleport did not validate the host the user requests a connection to is in the list of principals on the certificate. To ensure a seamless upgrade, make sure the hosts you connect to have the appropriate address set in `public_addr` in `teleport.yaml` before upgrading.

## 2.6.0

This release of Teleport brings new features, significant performance and
usability improvements as well usual bugfixes.

During this release cycle, the Teleport source code has been audited for
security vulnerabilities by Cure53 and this release (2.6.0) contains patches
for the discovered problems.

#### New Features

* Support for DynamoDB for storing the audit log events. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for Amazon S3 for storing the recorded SSH sessions. [#1755](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1755)
* Support for rotating certificate authorities (CA rotation). [#1899] (https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1899)
* Integration with Linux PAM (pluggable authentication modules) subsystem. [#742](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/742) and [#1766](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1766)
* The new CLI command `tsh status` shows users which Teleport clusters they are authenticated with. [#1628](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1628)

Additionally, Teleport 2.6.0 has been submitted to the AWS marketplace. Soon
AWS users will be able to create properly configured, secure and highly
available Teleport clusters with ease.

#### Configuration Changes

* Role templates (depreciated in Teleport 2.3) were fully removed. We recommend
  migrating to role variables which are documented [here](./docs/pages/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx)

* Resource names (like roles, connectors, trusted clusters) can no longer
  contain unicode or other special characters. Update the names of all user
  created resources to only include characters, hyphens, and dots.

* `advertise_ip` has been deprecated and replaced with `public_addr` setting. See [#1803](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1803)
  The existing configuration files will still work, but we advise Teleport
  administrators to update it to reflect the new format.

* Teleport no longer uses `boltdb` back-end for storing cluster state _by
  default_.  The new default is called `dir` and it uses simple JSON files
  stored in `/var/lib/teleport/backend`. This change applies to brand new
  Teleport installations, the existing clusters will continue to use `boltdb`.

* The default set of enabled cryptographic primitives has been
  updated to reflect the latest state of SSH and TLS security. [#1856](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1856).

#### Bug Fixes

The list of most visible bug fixes in this release:

* `tsh` now properly handles Ctrl+C [#1882](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1882)
* High CPU utilization on ARM platforms during daemon start-up. [#1886](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1886)
* Terminal window size can get out of sync on AWS. [#1874](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1874)
* Some CLI commands print errors twice. [#1889](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1889)
* SSH session playback can be interrupted for long sessions. [#1774](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1774)
* Processing `HUP` UNIX signal is unreliable when `teleport` daemon runs under `systemd`. [#1844](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1844)

#### Bug Fixes

* Binaries for macOS have been rebuilt to resolve "certificate signed by a unknown authority" issue.

## 2.5.0

This is a major release of Teleport. Its goal is to make cloud-native
deployments easier. Numerous AWS users have contributed feedback to this
release, which includes:

#### New Features

* Auth servers in highly available (HA) configuration can share the same `/var/lib/teleport`
  data directory when it's hosted on NFS (or AWS EFS).
  [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)

* There is now an AWS reference deployment in `examples/aws` directory.  It
  uses Terraform and demonstrates how to deploy large Teleport clusters on AWS
  using best practices like auto-scaling groups, security groups, secrets
  management, load balancers, etc.

* The Teleport daemon now implements built-in connection draining which allows
  zero-downtime upgrades.  [See
  documentation](docs/pages/upgrading.mdx).

* Dynamic join tokens for new nodes can now be explicitly set via `tctl node add --token`.
  This allows Teleport admins to use an external mechanism for generating
  cluster invitation tokens.
  [#1615](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1615)

* Teleport now correctly manages certificates for accessing proxies behind a
  load balancer with the same domain name. The new configuration parameter
  `public_addr` must be used for this.
  [#1174](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1174).

#### Improvements

* Switching to a new TLS-based auth server API improves performance of large clusters.
  [#1528](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* Session recordings are now compressed by default using gzip. This reduces storage
  requirements by up to 80% in our real-world tests.
  [#1579](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* More user-friendly authentication errors in Teleport audit log helps Teleport admins
  troubleshoot configuration errors when integrating with SAML/OIDC providers.
  [#1554](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1554),
  [#1553](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1553),
  [#1599](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1599)

* `tsh` client will now report if a server's API is no longer compatible.

#### Bug Fixes

* `tsh logout` will now correctly log out from all active Teleport sessions. This is useful
  for users who're connected to multiple Teleport clusters at the same time.
  [#1541](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1541)

* When parsing YAML, Teleport now supports `--` list item separator to create
  multiple resources with a single `tctl create` command.
  [#1663](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1663)

* Fixed a panic in the Web UI backend [#1558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1558)

#### Behavior Changes

Certain components of Teleport behave differently in version 2.5. It is important to
note that these changes are not breaking Teleport functionality. They improve
Teleport behavior on large clusters deployed on highly dynamic cloud
environments such as AWS. This includes:

* Session list in the Web UI is now limited to 1,000 sessions.
* The audit log and recorded session storage has been moved from `/var/lib/teleport/log`
  to `/var/lib/teleport/log/<auth-server-id>`. This is related to [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)
  described above.
* When connecting a trusted cluster users can no longer pick an arbitrary name for them.
  Their own (local) names will be used, i.e. the `cluster_name` setting now defines how
  the cluster is seen from the outside.
  [#1543](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1543)

## 2.0.5

Teleport 2.0.5 contains a variety of security fixes. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 2.0.0 and above to upgrade to 2.0.5.

The most pressing issues (a phishing attack which can potentially be used to extract plaintext credentials and an attack where an already authenticated user can escalate privileges) can be resolved by upgrading the web proxy. However, however all nodes need to be upgraded to mitigate all vulnerabilities.

### Bugfixes

* Patch for TLP-01-001 and TLP-01-003: Check redirect.
* Patch for TLP-01-004: Always check is namespace is valid.
* Patch for TLP-01-005: Check user principal when joining session.
* Patch for TLP-01-006 and TLP-01-007: Validate Session ID.
* Patch for TLP-01-008: Use a fake hash for password authentication if user does not exist.
* Patch for TLP-01-009: Command injection in scp.

## 2.0.4

### Bugfixes
