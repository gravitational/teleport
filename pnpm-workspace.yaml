# Without this, electron-builder will pull in electron-builder-squirrel-windows (which we don't need)
# and that dep will in turn pull electron-winstaller (which we also don't need). pnpm will then
# start complaining that electron-winstaller is not in onlyBuiltDependencies.
#
# We could instead solve this by adding electron-winstaller to ignoredBuiltDependencies, but why
# pull in deps that we don't use? Ultimately, the problem is that electron-builder-squirrel-windows
# is defined as a peer dep of one of electron-builder deps, while in reality it's more like an
# optional dep.
