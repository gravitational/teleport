# This workflow is run whenever a pull request is opened, re-opened, or taken
# out of draft (ready for review). 
#
# NOTE: pull_request_target behaves the same as pull_request except it grants a
# read/write token to workflows running on a pull request from a fork. While
# this may seem unsafe, the permissions for the token are limited below and
# the permissions can not be changed without merging to master which is
# protected by CODEOWNERS.
