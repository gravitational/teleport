# This workflow is run whenever a pull request is opened, re-opened, or taken
# out of draft (ready for review). 
#
# NOTE: pull_request_target behaves the same as pull_request except it grants a
# read/write token to workflows running on a pull request from a fork. While this 
# may seem unsafe, we are limiting the permissions of the Github token below.
