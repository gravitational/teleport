# This workflow will run every 30 minutes and dismiss stale workflow runs on
# open pull requests. Stale workflow runs on pull requests are runs that are
# no longer up-to-date due to a new pull_request_target or pull_request_review
# event occurring.
#
# This workflow is specifically in place to dismiss stale runs for external
# contributors because the `Check` workflow token does not have write access
# to actions when a pull_request_review event triggers it from a fork. Stale
# workflow runs need to be removed by this workflow otherwise they will persist
# on the pull request's requirements record and not reflect the correct state
# of the checks.
