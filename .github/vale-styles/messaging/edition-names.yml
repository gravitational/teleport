message: '"%s" is no longer a recognized Teleport edition. Use "Teleport Enterprise" instead, and clarify the hosting type rather than including it in the name of the product. For example, you could say, "For managed Teleport Enterprise...", "Teleport Enterprise (managed)", "self-hosted Teleport Enterprise," etc., as long as the implication is that Teleport Enterprise is a single product that users can host in two ways. If the hosting type is not important in a given sentence, there is no need to specify it.'
