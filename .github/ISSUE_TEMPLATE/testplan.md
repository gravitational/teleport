## Manual Testing Plan

Below are the items that should be manually tested with each release of Teleport.
These tests should be run on both a fresh installation of the version to be released
as well as an upgrade of the previous version of Teleport.

- [ ] Adding nodes to a cluster
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Valid Static Token
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Valid Short-lived Tokens
  - [ ] Adding Nodes via Invalid Token Fails
  - [ ] Revoking Node Invitation

- [ ] Labels
  - [ ] Static Labels
  - [ ] Dynamic Labels

- [ ] Trusted Clusters
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Valid Static Token
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Valid Short-lived Token
  - [ ] Adding Trusted Cluster Invalid Token
  - [ ] Removing Trusted Cluster
  - [ ] Changing role map of existing Trusted Cluster

- [ ] RBAC

  Make sure that invalid and valid attempts are reflected in audit log. Do this with both Teleport and [Agentless nodes](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/openssh/).

  - [ ] Successfully connect to node with correct role
  - [ ] Unsuccessfully connect to a node in a role restricting access by label
  - [ ] Unsuccessfully connect to a node in a role restricting access by invalid SSH login
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: SSH agent forwarding
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: Port forwarding
  - [ ] Allow/deny role option: SSH file copying

- [ ] Verify that custom PAM environment variables are available as expected.

- [ ] Users

    With every user combination, try to login and signup with invalid second
    factor, invalid password to see how the system reacts.

    WebAuthn in the release `tsh` binary is implemented using libfido2 for
    linux/macOS. Ask for a statically built pre-release binary for realistic
    tests. (`tsh fido2 diag` should work in our binary.) Webauthn in Windows
    build is implemented using `webauthn.dll`. (`tsh webauthn diag` with
    security key selected in dialog should work.)

    Touch ID requires a signed `tsh`, ask for a signed pre-release binary so you
    may run the tests.

    Windows Webauthn requires Windows 10 19H1 and device capable of Windows
    Hello.

  - [ ] Teleport runs with SQLite
  - [ ] Teleport runs with Firestore
    - [ ] GCP integration tests are passing
  - [ ] Teleport runs with Postgres

- [ ] Session Recording
  - [ ] Session recording can be disabled
  - [ ] Sessions can be recorded at the node
    - [ ] Sessions in remote clusters are recorded in remote clusters
  - [ ] [Sessions can be recorded at the proxy](https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/recording-proxy-mode/)
    - [ ] Sessions on remote clusters are recorded in the local cluster
    - [ ] With an OpenSSH server without a Teleport CA signed host certificate:
      - [ ] Host key checking enabled rejects connection
      - [ ] Host key checking disabled allows connection

- [ ] Enhanced Session Recording
  - [ ] `disk`, `command` and `network` events are being logged.
  - [ ] Recorded events can be enforced by the `enhanced_recording` role option.
  - [ ] Enhanced session recording can be enabled on CentOS 7 with kernel 5.8+.

- [ ] Auditd
  - [ ] When auditd is enabled, audit events are recorded — https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/7744f72c6eb631791434b648ba41083b5f6d2278/lib/auditd/common.go#L25-L34
    - [ ] SSH session start — user login event
    - [ ] SSH session end
    - [ ] SSH Login failures — SSH auth error
    - [ ] SSH Login failures — unknown OS user
    - [ ] Session ID is correct (only true when Teleport runs as systemd service)
    - [ ] Teleport user is recorded as an auditd event field

- [ ] Audit Log
  - [ ] Audit log with dynamodb
    - [ ] AWS integration tests are passing
  - [ ] Audit log with Firestore
    - [ ] GCP integration tests are passing
  - [ ] Failed login attempts are recorded
  - [ ] Interactive sessions have the correct Server ID
    - [ ] `server_id` is the ID of the node in "session_recording: node" mode
    - [ ] `server_id` is the ID of the node in "session_recording: proxy" mode
    - [ ] `forwarded_by` is the ID of the proxy in "session_recording: proxy" mode

    Node/Proxy ID may be found at `/var/lib/teleport/host_uuid` in the
    corresponding machine.

    Node IDs may also be queried via `tctl nodes ls`.

  - [ ] Exec commands are recorded
  - [ ] `scp` commands are recorded
  - [ ] Subsystem results are recorded

    Subsystem testing may be achieved using both
    [Recording Proxy mode](
    https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/architecture/proxy/#recording-proxy-mode)
    and
    [OpenSSH integration](
    https://goteleport.com/docs/server-access/guides/openssh/).

    Assuming the proxy is `proxy.example.com:3023` and `node1` is a node running
    OpenSSH/sshd, you may use the following command to trigger a subsystem audit
    log:

    ```shell
    sftp -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" root@node1
    ```

- [ ] External Audit Storage

    External Audit Storage must be tested on an Enterprise Cloud tenant.
    Instructions for deploying a custom release to a cloud staging tenant: https://github.com/gravitational/teleport.e/blob/master/dev-deploy.md

    - [ ] Audit Events and Session Recordings (created after EAS enabled) can be queried and played in the web UI
    - [ ] `tsh play <session-id>` works
  - [ ] Existing EAS configuration can be replaced with a new one via Discover flow
  - [ ] Existing EAS configuration can be deleted (disabling EAS)

### Teleport with EKS/GKE

* [ ] Deploy Teleport on a single EKS cluster
* [ ] Deploy Teleport on two EKS clusters and connect them via trusted cluster feature
* [ ] Deploy Teleport Proxy outside GKE cluster fronting connections to it (use [this script](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh) to generate a kubeconfig)
* [ ] Deploy Teleport Proxy outside EKS cluster fronting connections to it (use [this script](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh) to generate a kubeconfig)

### Teleport with multiple Kubernetes clusters

Note: you can use GKE or EKS or minikube to run Kubernetes clusters.
Minikube is the only caveat - it's not reachable publicly so don't run a proxy there.

* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy/kubernetes_service outside a Kubernetes cluster, using a kubeconfig
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy/kubernetes_service inside a Kubernetes cluster
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy combo auth/proxy_service outside the Kubernetes cluster and kubernetes_service inside of a Kubernetes cluster, connected over a reverse tunnel
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has your cluster
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh`
  * [ ] Verify that the audit log recorded the above request and session
* [ ] Deploy a second kubernetes_service inside another Kubernetes cluster, connected over a reverse tunnel
  * [ ] Login with `tsh login`, check that `tsh kube ls` has both clusters
  * [ ] Switch to a second cluster using `tsh kube login`
  * [ ] Run `kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl exec -it $SOME_POD -- sh` on the new cluster

  * [ ] Verify that all kubes registered are shown with correct `name` and `labels`
  * [ ] Verify that clicking on a rows connect button renders a dialogue on manual instructions with `Step 2` login value matching the rows `name` column
  * [ ] Verify searching for `name` or `labels` in the search bar works
  * [ ] Verify you can sort by `name` colum

### Kubernetes exec via WebSockets/SPDY

To control usage of websockets on kubectl side environment variable `KUBECTL_REMOTE_COMMAND_WEBSOCKETS` can be used:
`KUBECTL_REMOTE_COMMAND_WEBSOCKETS=true kubectl -v 8 exec -n namespace podName -- /bin/bash --version`. With `-v 8` logging level
you should be able to see `X-Stream-Protocol-Version: v5.channel.k8s.io` in case kubectl is connected over websockets to Teleport.
To do tests you'll need kubectl version at least 1.29, Kubernetes cluster v1.29 or less (doesn't support websockets stream protocol v5)
and cluster v1.30 (does support it by default) and to access them both through kube agent and kubeconfig each.

* [ ] Check that you can exec into a cluster with `KUBECTL_REMOTE_COMMAND_WEBSOCKETS=false`
  * [ ] Cluster v1.29 in agent mode
  * [ ] Cluster v1.29 in kubeconfig mode
  * [ ] Cluster v1.30 in agent mode
  * [ ] Cluster v1.30 in kubeconfig mode
* [ ] Check that you can exec into a cluster with `KUBECTL_REMOTE_COMMAND_WEBSOCKETS=true`
  * [ ] Cluster v1.29 in agent mode
  * [ ] Cluster v1.29 in kubeconfig mode
  * [ ] Cluster v1.30 in agent mode (should see `X-Stream-Protocol-Version: v5.channel.k8s.io`)
  * [ ] Cluster v1.30 in kubeconfig mode (should see `X-Stream-Protocol-Version: v5.channel.k8s.io`)
* [ ] Test Kubernetes exec via javascript client - [client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/javascript/blob/45b68c98e62b6cc4152189b9fd4a27ad32781bc4/examples/typescript/exec/exec-example.ts)


### Kubernetes auto-discovery

* [ ] Test Kubernetes auto-discovery:

* [ ] Kubernetes Secret storage for Agent's Identity
    * [ ] Install Teleport agent with a short-lived token
      * [ ] Validate if the Teleport is installed as a Kubernetes `Statefulset`
      * [ ] Restart the agent after token TTL expires to see if it reuses the same identity.
    * [ ] Force cluster CA rotation

### Kubernetes Pod RBAC

* [ ] Verify the following scenarios for `kubernetes_resources`:
    * [ ] `{"kind":"pod","name":"*","namespace":"*"}` - must allow access to every pod.
    * [ ] `{"kind":"pod","name":"<somename>","namespace":"*"}` - must allow access to pod `<somename>` in every namespace.
    * [ ] `{"kind":"pod","name":"*","namespace":"<somenamespace>"}` - must allow access to any pod in `<somenamespace>` namespace.
    * [ ] Verify support for  `*` wildcards - `<some-name>-*` and regex for `name` and `namespace` fields.
    * [ ] Verify support for delete pods collection - must use `go-client`.
* [ ] Verify scenarios with multiple roles defining `kubernetes_resources`:
    * [ ] Validate that the returned list of pods is the union of every role.
    * [ ] Validate that access to other pods is denied by RBAC.
    * [ ] Validate that the Kubernetes Groups/Users are correctly selected depending on the role that applies to the pod.
        * [ ] Test with a `kubernetes_groups` that denies exec into a pod
* [ ] Verify the following scenarios for Resource Access Requests to Pods:
    * [ ] Create a valid resource access request and validate if access to other pods is denied.
    * [ ] Validate if creating a resource access request with Kubernetes resources denied by `search_as_roles` is not allowed.

### Teleport with FIPS mode

* [ ] Perform trusted clusters, Web and SSH sanity check with all teleport components deployed in FIPS mode.

### ACME

- [ ] Teleport can fetch TLS certificate automatically using ACME protocol.

### Migrations

* [ ] Migrate trusted clusters
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on main cluster, then rest of the servers on main cluster
        SSH should work for both main and old clusters
  * [ ] Migrate auth server on remote cluster, then rest of the remote cluster
       SSH should work

### Command Templates

When interacting with a cluster, the following command templates are useful:

#### OpenSSH

```
# when connecting to the recording proxy, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` is required.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# the above command only forwards the agent to the proxy, to forward the agent
# to the target node, `-o 'ForwardAgent yes'` needs to be passed twice.
ssh -o "ForwardAgent yes" \
  -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p" \
  node.example.com

# when connecting to a remote cluster using OpenSSH, the subsystem request is
# updated with the name of the remote cluster.
ssh -o "ProxyCommand ssh -o 'ForwardAgent yes' -p 3023 %r@proxy.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p@foo.com" \
  node.foo.com
```

#### Teleport

```
# when connecting to a OpenSSH node, remember `-p 22` needs to be passed.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -p 22 node.example.com

# an agent can be forwarded to the target node with `-A`
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh -A -p 22 node.example.com

# the --cluster flag is used to connect to a node in a remote cluster.
tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=<username> --insecure ssh --cluster=foo.com -p 22 node.foo.com
```

### `tctl sso` family of commands

For help with setting up sso connectors, check out the [Quick GitHub/SAML/OIDC Setup Tips]

`tctl sso configure` helps to construct a valid connector definition:

- [ ] `tctl sso configure github ...` creates valid connector definitions
- [ ] `tctl sso configure oidc ...` creates valid connector definitions
- [ ] `tctl sso configure saml ...` creates valid connector definitions

`tctl sso test` test a provided connector definition, which can be loaded from
file or piped in with `tctl sso configure` or `tctl get --with-secrets`. Valid
connectors are accepted, invalid are rejected with sensible error messages.

- [ ] Connectors can be tested with `tctl sso test`.

    - [ ] OIDC
        - [ ] Google Workspace
        - [ ] Non-Google IdP

### SSO login on remote host

- [ ] SSO login on a remote host

`tsh` should be running on a remote host (e.g. over an SSH session) and use the
local browser to complete and SSO login. Run
`tsh login --callback <remote.host>:<port> --bind-addr localhost:<port> --auth <auth>`
on the remote host. Note that the `--callback` URL must be able to resolve to the
`--bind-addr` over HTTPS.

`baz`: `quux`. Verify that a node running on the instance has labels
`gcp/label/foo=bar` and `gcp/tag/baz=quux`.

### Passwordless

This feature has additional build requirements, so it should be tested with a
pre-release build (eg: `https://cdn.teleport.dev/tsh-v16.0.0-alpha.2.pkg`).

This sections complements "Users -> Managing MFA devices". `tsh` binaries for
each operating system (Linux, macOS and Windows) must be tested separately for
FIDO2 items.

- [ ] Diagnostics

    Commands should pass all tests.

  - [ ] `tsh fido2 diag` (macOS/Linux)
  - [ ] `tsh touchid diag` (macOS only)
  - [ ] `tsh webauthnwin diag` (Windows only)

- [ ] Registration
  - [ ] Register a passworldess FIDO2 key (`tsh mfa add`, choose WEBAUTHN and
        passwordless)
    - [ ] macOS/Linux
    - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Register a platform authenticator
    - [ ] Touch ID credential (`tsh mfa add`, choose TOUCHID)
    - [ ] Windows hello credential (`tsh mfa add`, choose WEBAUTHN and
          passwordless)

- [ ] Login
  - [ ] Passwordless login using FIDO2 (`tsh login --auth=passwordless`)
    - [ ] macOS/Linux
    - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Passwordless login using platform authenticator (`tsh login --auth=passwordless`)
    - [ ] Touch ID
    - [ ] Windows Hello
  - [ ] `tsh login --auth=passwordless --mfa-mode=cross-platform` uses FIDO2
    - [ ] macOS/Linux
    - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] `tsh login --auth=passwordless --mfa-mode=platform` uses platform authenticator
    - [ ] Touch ID
    - [ ] Windows Hello
  - [ ] `tsh login --auth=passwordless --mfa-mode=auto` prefers platform authenticator
    - [ ] Touch ID
    - [ ] Windows Hello
  - [ ] Exercise credential picker (register credentials for multiple users in
        the same device)
    - [ ] FIDO2 macOS/Linux
    - [ ] Touch ID
    - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Passwordless disable switch works
        (`auth_service.authentication.passwordless = false`)
  - [ ] Cluster in passwordless mode defaults to passwordless
        (`auth_service.authentication.connector_name = passwordless`)
  - [ ] Cluster in passwordless mode allows MFA login
        (`tsh login --auth=local`)

- [ ] Touch ID support commands
  - [ ] `tsh touchid ls` works
  - [ ] `tsh touchid rm` works (careful, may lock you out!)

### Device Trust

Device Trust requires Teleport Enterprise.

This feature has additional build requirements, so it should be tested with a
pre-release build (eg: `https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-ent-v16.0.0-alpha.2-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz`).

Client-side enrollment requires a signed `tsh` for macOS, make sure to use the
`tsh` binary from `tsh.app`.

Additionally, Device Trust Web requires Teleport Connect to be installed (device
authentication for the Web is handled by Connect).

A simple formula for testing device authorization is:

```shell
# Before enrollment.
# Replace with other kinds of access, as appropriate (db, kube, etc)
tsh ssh node-that-requires-device-trust
> ERROR: ssh: rejected: administratively prohibited (unauthorized device)

# Register/enroll the device.
tsh device enroll --current-device
tsh logout; tsh login

# After enrollment
tsh ssh node-that-requires-device-trust
> $
```

- [ ] Inventory management
  - [ ] Add device (`tctl devices add`)
  - [ ] Add device and create enrollment token (`tctl devices add --enroll`)
  - [ ] List devices (`tctl devices ls`)
  - [ ] Remove device using device ID (`tctl devices rm`)
  - [ ] Remove device using asset tag (`tctl devices rm`)
  - [ ] Create enrollment token using device ID (`tctl devices enroll`)
  - [ ] Create enrollment token using asset tag (`tctl devices enroll`)

- [ ] Device enrollment
  - [ ] Enroll/authn device on macOS (`tsh device enroll`)
  - [ ] Enroll/authn device on Windows (`tsh device enroll`)
  - [ ] Enroll/authn device on Linux (`tsh device enroll`)

    Linux users need read/write permissions to /dev/tpmrm0. The simplest way is
    to assign yourself to the `tss` group. See
    https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/device-trust/device-management/#troubleshooting.

  - [ ] Verify device extensions on TLS certificate

    Note that different accesses have different certificates (Database, Kube,
    etc).

    ```shell
    $ openssl x509 -noout -in ~/.tsh/keys/zarquon/llama-x509.pem -nameopt sep_multiline -subject | grep 1.3.9999.3
    > 1.3.9999.3.1=6e60b9fd-1e3e-473d-b148-27b4f158c2a7
    > 1.3.9999.3.2=AAAAAAAAAAAA
    > 1.3.9999.3.3=661c9340-81b0-4a1a-a671-7b1304d28600
    ```

  - [ ] Verify device extensions on SSH certificate

    ```shell
    ssh-keygen -L -f ~/.tsh/keys/zarquon/llama-ssh/zarquon-cert.pub | grep teleport-device-
    teleport-device-asset-tag ...
    teleport-device-credential-id ...
    teleport-device-id ...
    ```

- [ ] Device authentication
  - [ ] tsh or Connect
    - [ ] SSH
    - [ ] DB Access
    - [ ] K8s Access
  - [ ] Web UI (requires Connect)
    - [ ] SSH
    - [ ] App Access
    - [ ] Desktop Access
    - [ ] GitHub user
    - [ ] OIDC user
    - [ ] SAML user

    Confirm that it works by failing first. Most protocols can be tested using
    device_trust.mode="required". App Access and Desktop Access require a custom
    role (see [enforcing device trust](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/device-trust/enforcing-device-trust/#app-access-support)).

    For SSO users confirm that device web authentication happens successfully.

- [ ] Device authorization
  - [ ] device_trust.mode other than "off" or "" not allowed (OSS)
  - [ ] device_trust.mode="off" doesn't impede access (Enterprise and OSS)
  - [ ] device_trust.mode="optional" doesn't impede access, but issues device
        extensions on login
  - [ ] device_trust.mode="required" enforces enrolled devices
    - [ ] SSH
    - [ ] DB Access
    - [ ] K8s Access
    - [ ] App Access NOT enforced in global mode
    - [ ] Desktop Access NOT enforced in global mode
  - [ ] Role-based authz enforces enrolled devices
        (device_trust.mode="optional" and role.spec.options.device_trust_mode="required")
    - [ ] SSH
    - [ ] DB Access
    - [ ] K8s Access
    - [ ] App Access
    - [ ] Desktop Access
  - [ ] Device authentication works correctly for both require_session_mfa=false
        and require_session_mfa=true
    - [ ] SSH
    - [ ] DB Access
    - [ ] K8s Access
    - [ ] Desktop Access
  - [ ] Device authorization applies to Trusted Clusters
        (root with mode="optional" and leaf with mode="required")

- [ ] Device audit (see [lib/events/codes.go][device_event_codes])
  - [ ] Inventory management actions issue events (success only)
  - [ ] Device enrollment issues device event (any outcomes)
  - [ ] Device authentication issues device event (any outcomes)
  - [ ] Device web authentication issues "Device Web Token Created" and "Device
        Web Authentication Confirmed" events
  - [ ] Device web authentication events have web_authentication_id set.
        Corresponding "Device Authenticated" events have both
        web_authentication=true and web_authentication_id set.
  - [ ] Events with [UserMetadata][event_trusted_device] contain TrustedDevice
        data (for certificates with device extensions)

- [ ] Binary support
  - [ ] Non-signed and/or non-notarized `tsh` for macOS gives a sane error
        message for `tsh device enroll` attempts.

- [ ] Device support commands
  - [ ] `tsh device collect`   (macOS)
  - [ ] `tsh device asset-tag` (macOS)
  - [ ] `tsh device collect`   (Windows)
  - [ ] `tsh device asset-tag` (Windows)
  - [ ] `tsh device collect`   (Linux)
  - [ ] `tsh device asset-tag` (Linux)

### Hardware Key Support

Hardware Key Support is an Enterprise feature and is not available for OSS.

You will need a YubiKey 4.3+ to test this feature.

This feature has additional build requirements, so it should be tested with a pre-release build (eg: `https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-ent-v16.0.0-alpha.2-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz`).

#### Server Access

This test should be carried out on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

Set `auth_service.authentication.require_session_mfa: hardware_key_touch` in your cluster auth settings and login.
- [ ] `tsh login`
  - [ ] Prompts for Yubikey touch with message "Tap your YubiKey" (separate from normal MFA prompt).
- [ ] Server Access `tsh ssh`
  - [ ] Requires yubikey to be connected

## Moderated session

Create two Teleport users, a moderator and a user. Configure Teleport roles to require that the moderator moderate the user's sessions. Use `TELEPORT_HOME` to `tsh login` as the user in one terminal, and the moderator in another.

Ensure the default `terminationPolicy` of `terminate` has not been changed.

For each of the following cases, create a moderated session with the user using `tsh ssh` and join this session with the moderator using `tsh join --role moderator`:
 - [ ] Ensure that `Ctrl+C` in the user terminal disconnects the moderator as the session has ended.
 - [ ] Ensure that `Ctrl+C` in the moderator terminal disconnects the moderator and terminates the user's session as the session no longer has a moderator.
 - [ ] Ensure that `t` in the moderator terminal terminates the session for all participants.

## Performance

### Scaling Test
Scale up the number of nodes/clusters a few times for each configuration below.

 1) Verify that there are no memory/goroutine/file descriptor leaks
 2) Compare the baseline metrics with the previous release to determine if resource usage has increased
 3) Restart all Auth instances and verify that all nodes/clusters reconnect

 Perform reverse tunnel node scaling tests for all backend configurations:
  - [ ] etcd - 10k
  - [ ] DynamoDB - 10k
  - [ ] Firestore - 10k
  - [ ] Postgres - 10k

  Perform the following additional scaling tests on DynamoDB:
 - [ ] 10k direct dial nodes.
 - [ ] 500 trusted clusters.

### Soak Test

Run 30 minute soak test directly against direct and tunnel nodes
and via label based matching. Tests should be run against a Cloud
tenant.

```shell
tsh bench ssh --duration=30m user@direct-dial-node ls
tsh bench ssh --duration=30m user@reverse-tunnel-node ls
tsh bench ssh --duration=30m user@foo=bar ls
tsh bench ssh --duration=30m --random user@foo ls
```

### Concurrent Session Test

* Cluster with 1k reverse tunnel nodes

Run a concurrent session test that will spawn 5 interactive sessions per node in the cluster:

```shell
tsh bench web sessions --max=5000 user ls
tsh bench web sessions --max=5000 --web user ls
```

- [ ] Verify that all 5000 sessions are able to be established.
- [ ] Verify that tsh and the web UI are still functional.

### Robustness

* Connectivity Issues:

- [ ] Verify that a lack of connectivity to Auth does not prevent access to
  resources which do not require a moderated session and in async recording
  mode from an already issued certificate.
- [ ] Verify that a lack of connectivity to Auth prevents access to resources
  which require a moderated session and in async recording mode from an already
  issued certificate.
- [ ] Verify that an open session is not terminated when all Auth instances
  are restarted.

## TLS Routing

- [ ] Verify that teleport proxy `v2` configuration starts only a single listener for proxy service, in contrast with `v1` configuration.
  Given configuration:
  ```
  version: v2
  proxy_service:
    enabled: "yes"
    public_addr: ['root.example.com']
    web_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3080
  ```
  There should be total of three listeners, with only `*:3080` for proxy service. Given the configuration above, 3022 and 3025 will be opened for other services.
  ```
  lsof -i -P | grep teleport | grep LISTEN
    teleport  ...  TCP *:3022 (LISTEN)
    teleport  ...  TCP *:3025 (LISTEN)
    teleport  ...  TCP *:3080 (LISTEN) # <-- proxy service
  ```
