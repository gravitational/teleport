        capabilities to multiple users.
    - [Authentication connectors](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/reference/authentication/#authentication-connectors):
      - For those you might want to use clusters that are deployed on the web, specified in
        parens. Or set up the connectors on a local enterprise cluster following [the guide from
        our wiki](https://gravitational.slab.com/posts/quick-git-hub-saml-oidc-setup-6dfp292a).
      - [ ] GitHub (asteroid)
        - [ ] local login on a GitHub-enabled cluster
      - [ ] SAML (platform cluster)
      - [ ] OIDC (e-demo)
  - Verify that all items from this section work on:
    - [ ] macOS
    - [ ] Windows
    - [ ] Linux
- Shell
  - [ ] Verify that the shell is pinned to the correct cluster (for root clusters and leaf
        clusters).
    - That is, opening new shell sessions in other workspaces or other clusters within the same
      workspace should have no impact on the original shell session.
  - [ ] Verify that the local shell is opened with correct env vars.
    - `TELEPORT_PROXY` and `TELEPORT_CLUSTER` should pin the session to the correct cluster.
    - `TELEPORT_HOME` should point to `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport Connect/tsh`.
    - `PATH` should include `/Applications/Teleport Connect.app/Contents/Resources/bin`.
  - [ ] Verify that the working directory in the tab title is updated when you change the directory
        (only for local terminals).
  - [ ] Verify that terminal resize works for both local and remote shells.
    - Install midnight commander on the node you ssh into: `$ sudo apt-get install mc`
    - Run the program: `$ mc`
    - Resize Teleport Connect to see if the panels resize with it
  - [ ] Verify that the tab automatically closes on `$ exit` command.
  - [ ] Verify that [Connect doesn't leave orphaned processes](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/27125).
    - Open a local shell session in Connect.
    - Open Activity Monitor, then View -> All Processes, Hierarchically.
    - Locate Teleport Connect. There should be Teleport Connect Helper process with a shell
      process under it.
    - Double-click that shell process to open a window with process details.
    - Close Teleport Connect without closing the tab first.
    - Verify that the separate Activity Monitor window for that process now says "terminated".
  - Verify that all items from this section work on:
    - [ ] macOS
    - [ ] Windows
    - [ ] Linux
- Kubernetes access
  - [ ] Open a new kubernetes tab, run `echo $KUBECONFIG` and check if it points to the file within Connect's app data directory.
  - [ ] Close the tab and open it again (to the same resource). Verify that the kubeconfig path didn't change.
  - [ ] Run `kubectl get pods -A` and verify that the command succeeds. Then create a pod with
        `kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/shell-demo.yaml` and exec into it with
        `kubectl exec --stdin --tty shell-demo -- /bin/bash`. Verify that the shell works.
    - For execing into a pod, you might need to [create a `ClusterRoleBinding` in
      k8s](https://goteleport.com/docs/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/static-kubeconfig/#kubernetes-authorization)
      for [the admin role](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles).
      Then you need to add the k8s group (which maps to the k8s admin role in
      `ClusterRoleBinding`) to `kubernetes_groups` of your Teleport role.
    - [ ] Repeat the above check for a k8s cluster connected to a leaf cluster.
  - Verify that the kubeconfig file is removed when the user:
    - [ ] Removes the connection
    - [ ] Logs out of the cluster

        the workspace of that cluster automatically.
  - [ ] Verify that the state of the current workspace is preserved when you change the workspace
        (by switching to another cluster) and return to the previous workspace.
  - [ ] Click "Add another cluster", provide an address to a cluster that was already added. Verify
        that Connect simply changes the workspace to that of that cluster.
  - [ ] Click "Add another cluster", provide an address to a new cluster and submit the form. Close
        the modal when asked for credentials. Verify that the cluster was still added and is visible in
        the profile selector.
- Search bar
  - [ ] Verify that you can connect to all three resources types on root clusters and leaf
        clusters.
  - [ ] Verify that picking a resource filter and a cluster filter at the same time works as
        expected.

        workspace of that root cluster.
  - Shut down a root cluster.
    - [ ] Verify that attempting to search returns "Some of the search results are incomplete" in
          the search bar.
    - [ ] Verify that clicking "Show details" next to the error message and then closing the modal
          by clicking one of the buttons or by pressing Escape does not close the search bar.
  - Log in as a user with a short TTL. Make sure you're not logged in to any other cluster. Wait for
    the cert to expire. Enter a search term that usually returns some results.
    - [ ] Relogin when asked. Verify that the search bar is not collapsed and shows search
          results.
    - [ ] Close the login modal instead of logging in. Verify that the search bar is not collapsed
          and shows "No matching results found".
- Resilience when resources become unavailable
  - DocumentCluster
    - For each scenario, create at least one DocumentCluster tab for each available resource kind.
    - For each scenario, first do the action described in the bullet point, then refetch list of
      resources by entering the search field and pressing enter. Verify that no unrecoverable
      error was raised (that is, the app still works). Then restart the app and verify that it was
      restarted gracefully (no unrecoverable error on restart, the user can continue using the
      app).
      - [ ] Stop the root cluster.
      - [ ] Stop a leaf cluster.
      - [ ] Disconnect your device from the internet.
  - DocumentGateway
    - [ ] Verify that you can't open more than one tab for the same db server + username pair.
          Trying to open a second tab with the same pair should just switch you to the already
          existing tab.
    - [ ] Create a db connection tab for a given database. Then remove access to that db for that
          user. Go back to Connect and change the database name and port. Both actions should not
          return an error.
    - [ ] Open DocumentCluster and make sure a given db is visible on the list of available dbs.
          Click "Connect" to show a list of db users. Now remove access to that db. Go back to Connect
          and choose a username. Verify that a recoverable error is shown and the user can continue
          using the app.
    - [ ] Create a db connection, close the app, run `tsh proxy db` with the same port, start the
          app. Verify that the app doesn't crash and the db connection tab shows you the error
          (address in use) and offers a way to retry creating the connection.
      - Verify that this works on:
        - [ ] macOS
        - [ ] Windows

- Refreshing certs
  - To test scenarios from this section, create a user with a role that has TTL of `1m`
    (`spec.options.max_session_ttl`).
  - Log in, create a db connection and run the CLI command; wait for the cert to expire, make
    another connection to the local db proxy.
    - [ ] Verify that the window received focus and a modal login is shown.
      - Verify that this works on:
        - [ ] macOS
        - [ ] Windows
        - [ ] Linux
    - Verify that after successfully logging in:
      - [ ] The cluster info is synced.
      - [ ] The first connection wasn't dropped; try executing `select now();`, the client should
            be able to automatically reinstantiate the connection.
      - [ ] The database proxy is able to handle new connections; click "Run" in the db tab and
            see if it connects without problems. You might need to resync the cluster again in case
            they managed to expire.
    - [ ] Verify that closing the login modal without logging in shows an appropriate error.
  - Log in, create a db connection, then remove access to that db server for that user; wait for
    the cert to expire, then attempt to make a connection through the proxy; log in.
    - [ ] Verify that psql shows an appropriate access denied error ("access to db denied. User
          does not have permissions. Confirm database user and name").
  - Log in, open a cluster tab, wait for the cert to expire. Switch from a servers view to
    databases view.

    - [ ] Verify that after logging in, the database list is shown.
  - Log in, set up two db connections. Wait for the cert to expire. Attempt to connect to the first
    proxy, then without logging in proceed to connect to the second proxy.
    - [ ] Verify that an error notification was shown related to another login attempt being in
          progress.

    - Change `show_resources` to `accessible_only` in [the UI config](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/resources/#ui-config) of the root cluster.
      - [ ] Verify that you can now only request resources from the new request tab.
  - **Viewing & Approving/Denying Requests**
    - To setup a test environment, follow the steps laid out in `Viewing & Approving/Denying Requests` from the Web UI testplan and then verify the tasks below.
    - [ ] Verify you can view access request from request list
    - [ ] Verify you can approve a request with message, and immediately see updated state with
          your review stamp (green checkmark) and message box
    - [ ] Verify you can deny a request, and immediately see updated state with your review stamp
          (red cross)
    - [ ] Verify deleting the denied request is removed from list
  - **Assuming Approved Requests (Role Based)**
    - [ ] Verify that assuming `allow-roles-and-nodes` allows you to see roles screen and ssh into
          nodes
    - [ ] After assuming `allow-roles-and-nodes`, verify that assuming `allow-users-with-short-ttl`
          allows you to see users screen, and denies access to nodes
    - [ ] Verify a switchback banner is rendered with roles assumed, and count down of when it
          expires
    - [ ] Verify `switching back` goes back to your default static role
    - [ ] Verify after re-assuming `allow-users-with-short-ttl` role, the user is automatically logged
          out after the expiry is met (4 minutes)
  - **Assuming Approved Requests (Search Based)**
    - [ ] Verify that assuming approved request, allows you to see the resources you've requested.
  - **Assuming Approved Requests (Both)**

          viewing
    - [ ] Verify that after re-login, requests that are not expired and are approved are assumable
          again
- Configuration
  - [ ] Verify that clicking on More Options icon `⋮` > Open Config File opens the `app_config.json` file in your editor.
    - Verify that this works on:
      - [ ] macOS
      - [ ] Windows
      - [ ] Linux
  - Change a config property and restart the app. Verify that the change has been applied.
    - [ ] Change a keyboard shortcut.
    - [ ] Change `terminal.fontFamily`.
  - Provide the same keyboard shortcut for two actions.
    - [ ] Verify that a notification is displayed saying that a duplicate shortcut was found.
  - Provide an invalid value for some property (for example, set `"keymap.tab1": "ABC"`).
    - [ ] Verify that a notification is displayed saying that the property has an invalid value.
  - Make a syntax error in the file (for example, set `"keymap.tab1": not a string`).
    - [ ] Verify that a notification is displayed saying that the config file was not loaded correctly.
    - [ ] Verify that your config changes were not overridden.
- Headless auth
  - Headless auth modal in Connect can be triggered by calling `tsh ls --headless --user=<username> --proxy=<proxy>`. The cluster needs to have webauthn enabled for it to work.
  - [ ] Verify the basic operations (approve, reject, ignore then accept in the Web UI).
  - [ ] Make a headless request then cancel the command. Verify that the modal in Connect was
        closed automatically.
  - [ ] Make a headless request then accept it in the Web UI. Verify that the modal in Connect was
        closed automatically.
  - [ ] Make two concurrent headless requests for the same cluster. Verify that Connect shows the
        second one after closing the modal for the first request.
  - [ ] Make two concurrent headless requests for two different clusters. Verify that Connect shows
        the second one after closing the modal for the first request.
- Per-session MFA
  - The easiest way to test it is to enable [cluster-wide per-session
    MFA](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa/#cluster-wide).
  - [ ] Verify that connecting to a Kube cluster prompts for MFA.
    - [ ] Re-execute `kubectl exec --stdin --tty shell-demo -- /bin/bash` mentioned above to
          verify that Kube access is working with MFA.
  - [ ] Verify that Connect prompts for MFA during Connect My Computer setup.
- Connect My Computer
  - [ ] Verify the happy path from clean slate (no existing role) setup: set up the node and then
        connect to it.
  - Kill the agent while its joining the cluster and verify that the logs from the agent process
    are shown in the UI.
    - The easiest way to do this is by following the agent cleanup daemon logs (`tail -F ~/Library/Application\ Support/Teleport\ Connect/logs/cleanup.log`) and then `kill -s KILL <agent PID>`.
    - [ ] During setup.
    - [ ] After setup in the status view. Verify that the page says that the process exited with
          SIGKILL.
  - [ ] Open the node config, change the proxy address to an incorrect one to simulate problems
        with connection. Verify that the app kills the agent after the agent is not able to join the
        cluster within the timeout.
  - [ ] Verify autostart behavior. The agent should automatically start on app start unless it was
        manually stopped before exiting the app.
  - Verify that all items from this section work on:
    - [ ] macOS
    - [ ] Windows
    - [ ] Linux
- VNet
  - VNet doesn't work with local clusters made available under custom domains through entries in
    `/etc/hosts`. It's best to use a "real" cluster. nip.io might work, but it hasn't been confirmed
    yet.
  - Verify that VNet works for TCP apps within:
    - [ ] a root cluster
    - [ ] [a custom DNS zone](https://goteleport.com/docs/application-access/guides/vnet/) of a root cluster
    - [ ] a leaf cluster
    - [ ] a custom DNS zone of a leaf cluster
  - [ ] Verify that setting [a custom IPv4 CIDR range](https://goteleport.com/docs/application-access/guides/vnet/#configuring-ipv4-cidr-range) works.
  - [ ] Verify that Connect asks for relogin when attempting to connect to an app after cert expires.
    - Be mindful that you need to connect to the app at least once before the cert expires for
      Connect to properly recognize it as a TCP app.
  - Start the app with debug logs on and tail `tshd.log`. Verify that the UI works correctly in the
    following scenarios:
    - All buth the first point assume that you successfully go through the osascript prompt.
    - Close the osascript prompt.
      - [ ] The VNet panel shows info about the password prompt being closed.
    - Start VNet, then stop it.
      - [ ] The VNet panel doesn't show any errors related to VNet being stopped.
    - Start VNet, then remove the socket file used for communication with the admin process. It's reported in
      `tshd.log` as `Created unix socket for admin subcommand socket:<path>`.
      - [ ] The VNet panel shows an unexpected shutdown of VNet and an in-app notification is shown.
      - [ ] The admin process cleans up files in `/etc/resolver`.
    - Start VNet. While its running, kill the admin process.
      - The easiest way to find the PID of the admin process is to open Activity Monitor, View →
        All Processes, Hierarchically, search for `tsh` and find tsh running under kernel_task →
        authtrampoline → bash → tsh. Then just `sudo kill -s KILL <tsh pid>`.
      - [ ] The VNet panel shows an unexpected shutdown of VNet and an in-app notification is shown.
      - [ ] The admin process _leaves_ files in `/etc/resolver`. However, it's possible to start
        VNet again, connect to a TCP app, then shut VNet down and it results in the files being
        cleaned up.
- Misc
  - [ ] Verify that logs are collected for all processes (main, renderer, shared, tshd) under
        `~/Library/Application\ Support/Teleport\ Connect/logs`.
  - [ ] Verify that the password from the login form is not saved in the renderer log.
  - [ ] Log in to a cluster, then log out and log in again as a different user. Verify that the app
        works properly after that.
  - [ ] Clean the Application Support dir for Connect. Start the latest stable version of the app.
        Open every possible document. Close the app. Start the current alpha. Reopen the tabs. Verify that
        the app was able to reopen the tabs without any errors.
