## Access Requests

Access Request is a Enterprise feature and is not available for OSS.

### Creating Access Requests (Role Based)
Create a role with limited permissions `allow-roles-and-nodes`. This role allows you to see the Role screen and ssh into all nodes.

```
kind: role
metadata:
  name: allow-roles-and-nodes
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    - root
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    rules:
    - resources:
      - role
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 8h0m0s
version: v5

```

Create another role with limited permissions `allow-users-with-short-ttl`. This role session expires in 4 minutes, allows you to see Users screen, and denies access to all nodes.

```
kind: role
metadata:
  name: allow-users-with-short-ttl
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      - user
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
  deny:
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 4m0s
version: v5
```

Create a user that has no access to anything but allows you to request roles:
```
kind: role
metadata:
  name: test-role-based-requests
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles:
      - allow-roles-and-nodes
      - allow-users-with-short-ttl
      suggested_reviewers:
      - random-user-1
      - random-user-2
version: v5
```

- [ ] Verify that under requestable roles, only `allow-roles-and-nodes` and `allow-users-with-short-ttl` are listed
- [ ] Verify you can select/input/modify reviewers
- [ ] Verify you can view the request you created from request list (should be in pending states)
- [ ] Verify there is list of reviewers you selected (empty list if none selected AND suggested_reviewers wasn't defined)
- [ ] Verify you can't review own requests

### Creating Access Requests (Search Based)
Create a role with access to searcheable resources (apps, db, kubes, nodes, desktops). The template `searcheable-resources` is below.

```
kind: role
metadata:
  name: searcheable-resources
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:  # just example labels
      label1-key: label1-value
      env: [dev, staging]
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'   # asteriks gives user access to everything
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    windows_desktop_labels:
      '*': '*'
version: v5
```

Create a user that has no access to resources, but allows you to search them:

```
kind: role
metadata:
  name: test-search-based-requests
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
      - searcheable resources
      suggested_reviewers:
      - random-user-1
      - random-user-2
version: v5
```

- [ ] Verify that a user can see resources based on the `searcheable-resources` rules
- [ ] Verify you can select/input/modify reviewers
- [ ] Verify you can view the request you created from request list (should be in pending states)
- [ ] Verify there is list of reviewers you selected (empty list if none selected AND suggested_reviewers wasn't defined)
- [ ] Verify you can't review own requests
- [ ] Verify that you can't mix adding resources from different clusters (there should be a warning dialogue that clears the selected list)

### Viewing & Approving/Denying Requests
Create a user with the role `reviewer` that allows you to review all requests, and delete them.
```
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      roles: ['*']
```
- [ ] Verify you can view access request from request list
- [ ] Verify you can approve a request with message, and immediately see updated state with your review stamp (green checkmark) and message box
- [ ] Verify you can deny a request, and immediately see updated state with your review stamp (red cross)
- [ ] Verify deleting the denied request is removed from list

- [ ] Verify that assuming `allow-roles-and-nodes` allows you to see roles screen and ssh into nodes
- [ ] After assuming `allow-roles-and-nodes`, verify that assuming `allow-users-short-ttl` allows you to see users screen, and denies access to nodes
  - [ ] Verify a switchback banner is rendered with roles assumed, and count down of when it expires
  - [ ] Verify `switching back` goes back to your default static role
  - [ ] Verify after re-assuming `allow-users-short-ttl` role, the user is automatically logged out after the expiry is met (4 minutes)

### Assuming Approved Requests (Search Based)
- [ ] Verify that assuming approved request, allows you to see the resources you've requested.
### Assuming Approved Requests (Both)
- [ ] Verify assume buttons are only present for approved request and for logged in user
- [ ] Verify that after clicking on the assume button, it is disabled in both the list and in viewing
- [ ] Verify that after re-login, requests that are not expired and are approved are assumable again

      - [Authentication connectors](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/reference/authentication/#authentication-connectors):
         - For those you might want to use clusters that are deployed on the web, specified in
           parens. Or set up the connectors on a local enterprise cluster following [the guide from
           our wiki](https://gravitational.slab.com/posts/quick-git-hub-saml-oidc-setup-6dfp292a).
         - [ ] GitHub (asteroid)
            - [ ] local login on a GitHub-enabled cluster
         - [ ] SAML (platform cluster)
         - [ ] OIDC (e-demo)
   - Verify that all items from this section work on:
      - [ ] macOS
      - [ ] Windows
      - [ ] Linux
- Shell
   - [ ] Verify that the shell is pinned to the correct cluster (for root clusters and leaf
     clusters).
      - That is, opening new shell sessions in other workspaces or other clusters within the same
        workspace should have no impact on the original shell session.
   - [ ] Verify that the local shell is opened with correct env vars.
      - `TELEPORT_PROXY` and `TELEPORT_CLUSTER` should pin the session to the correct cluster.
      - `TELEPORT_HOME` should point to `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport Connect/tsh`.
      - `PATH` should include `/Applications/Teleport Connect.app/Contents/Resources/bin`.
   - [ ] Verify that the working directory in the tab title is updated when you change the directory
         (only for local terminals).
   - [ ] Verify that terminal resize works for both local and remote shells.
      - Install midnight commander on the node you ssh into: `$ sudo apt-get install mc`
      - Run the program: `$ mc`
      - Resize Teleport Connect to see if the panels resize with it
   - [ ] Verify that the tab automatically closes on `$ exit` command.
   - [ ] Verify that [Connect doesn't leave orphaned processes](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/27125).
      - Open a local shell session in Connect.
      - Open Activity Monitor, then View -> All Processes, Hierarchically.
      - Locate Teleport Connect. There should be Teleport Connect Helper process with a shell
        process under it.
      - Double-click that shell process to open a window with process details.
      - Close Teleport Connect without closing the tab first.
      - Verify that the separate Activity Monitor window for that process now says "terminated".
   - Verify that all items from this section work on:
      - [ ] macOS
      - [ ] Windows
      - [ ] Linux
- Kubernetes access
   - [ ] Open a new kubernetes tab, run `echo $KUBECONFIG` and check if it points to the file within Connect's app data directory.
   - [ ] Close the tab and open it again (to the same resource). Verify that the kubeconfig path didn't change.
   - [ ] Run `kubectl get pods -A` and verify that the command succeeds. Then create a pod with
     `kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/shell-demo.yaml` and exec into it with
     `kubectl exec --stdin --tty shell-demo -- /bin/bash`. Verify that the shell works.
      - For execing into a pod, you might need to [create a `ClusterRoleBinding` in
        k8s](https://goteleport.com/docs/kubernetes-access/register-clusters/static-kubeconfig/#kubernetes-authorization)
        for [the admin role](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles).
        Then you need to add the k8s group (which maps to the k8s admin role in
        `ClusterRoleBinding`) to `kubernetes_groups` of your Teleport role.
      - [ ] Repeat the above check for a k8s cluster connected to a leaf cluster.
   - Verify that the kubeconfig file is removed when the user:
      - [ ] Removes the connection
      - [ ] Logs out of the cluster
      - [ ] Closes Teleport Connect
   - Verify that all items from this section work on:
      - [ ] macOS
      - [ ] Windows
      - [ ] Linux
- State restoration from disk
   - [ ] Verify that the app asks about restoring previous tabs when launched and restores them
         properly.
   - [ ] Verify that the app opens with the cluster that was active when you closed the app.
   - [ ] Verify that the app remembers size & position after restart.
      - Verify that this works on:
         - [ ] macOS
         - [ ] Windows
         - [ ] Linux
   - [ ] Verify that [reopening a cluster that has no workspace
     assigned](https://github.com/gravitational/webapps.e/issues/275#issuecomment-1131663575) works.
   - [ ] Verify that reopening the app after removing `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport
     Connect/tsh` doesn't crash the app.
   - [ ] Verify that reopening the app after removing `~/Library/Application Support/Teleport
     Connect/app_state.json` but not the `tsh` dir doesn't crash the app.
   - [ ] Verify that logging out of a cluster and then logging in to the same cluster doesn't
     remember previous tabs (they should be cleared on logout).
   - [ ] Open a db connection tab. Change the db name and port. Close the tab. Restart the app. Open
     connection tracker and choose said db connection from it. Verify that the newly opened tab uses
     the same db name and port.
   - [ ] Log in to a cluster. Close the DocumentCluster tab. Open a new DocumentCluster tab. Restart
     the app. Verify that the app doesn't ask you about restoring previous tabs.
- Connections picker
   - [ ] Verify that the connections picker shows new connections when ssh & db tabs are opened.
   - [ ] Check if those connections are available after the app restart.
   - [ ] Check that those connections are removed after you log out of the root cluster that they
         belong to.
   - [ ] Verify that reopening a db connection from the connections picker remembers last used port.
- Cluster resources (servers, databases, k8s, apps)
   - [ ] Verify that the app shows the same resources as the Web UI.
   - [ ] Verify that search is working for the resources list.
   - [ ] Verify that pagination is working for the resources list.
   - [ ] Verify that pagination works in tandem with search, that is verify that search results are

         - [ ] macOS
         - [ ] Windows
         - [ ] Linux
   - [ ] Verify that clicking "Connect" shows available logins and db usernames.
      - Logins and db usernames are taken from the role, under `spec.allow.logins` and
        `spec.allow.db_users`.
   - [ ] Repeat the above steps for resources in leaf clusters.
- Tabs
   - [ ] Verify that tabs have correct titles set.
   - [ ] Verify that changing tab position works.
- Shortcuts
   - [ ] Verify that switching between tabs works on `Cmd+[1...9]`.

   - [ ] Verify that the other shortcuts work and each of them is shown on hover on relevant UI
     elements.
   - Verify that all items from this section work on:
      - [ ] macOS
      - [ ] Windows
      - [ ] Linux
- Workspaces & cluster management
   - [ ] Verify that logging in to a new cluster adds it to the identity switcher and switches to
     the workspace of that cluster automatically.
   - [ ] Verify that the state of the current workspace is preserved when you change the workspace
     (by switching to another cluster) and return to the previous workspace.
   - [ ] Click "Add another cluster", provide an address to a cluster that was already added. Verify
     that Connect simply changes the workspace to that of that cluster.
   - [ ] Click "Add another cluster", provide an address to a new cluster and submit the form. Close
     the modal when asked for credentials. Verify that the cluster was still added and is visible in
     the profile selector.
- Search bar
   - [ ] Verify that you can connect to all three resources types on root clusters and leaf
     clusters.
   - [ ] Verify that picking a resource filter and a cluster filter at the same time works as
     expected.

     workspace of that root cluster.
   - Shut down a root cluster.
      - [ ] Verify that attempting to search returns "Some of the search results are incomplete" in
        the search bar.
      - [ ] Verify that clicking "Show details" next to the error message and then closing the modal
        by clicking one of the buttons or by pressing Escape does not close the search bar.

     the cert to expire. Enter a search term that usually returns some results.
      - [ ] Relogin when asked. Verify that the search bar is not collapsed and shows search
        results.
      - [ ] Close the login modal instead of logging in. Verify that the search bar is not collapsed
        and shows "No matching results found".
- Resilience when resources become unavailable
   - DocumentCluster
      - For each scenario, create at least one DocumentCluster tab for each available resource kind.
      - For each scenario, first do the action described in the bullet point, then refetch list of
        resources by entering the search field and pressing enter. Verify that no unrecoverable
        error was raised (that is, the app still works). Then restart the app and verify that it was
        restarted gracefully (no unrecoverable error on restart, the user can continue using the
        app).
         - [ ] Stop the root cluster.
         - [ ] Stop a leaf cluster.
         - [ ] Disconnect your device from the internet.
   - DocumentGateway
      - [ ] Verify that you can't open more than one tab for the same db server + username pair.
        Trying to open a second tab with the same pair should just switch you to the already
        existing tab.
      - [ ] Create a db connection tab for a given database. Then remove access to that db for that
        user. Go back to Connect and change the database name and port. Both actions should not
        return an error.
      - [ ] Open DocumentCluster and make sure a given db is visible on the list of available dbs.
        Click "Connect" to show a list of db users. Now remove access to that db. Go back to Connect
        and choose a username. Verify that a recoverable error is shown and the user can continue
        using the app.
      - [ ] Create a db connection, close the app, run `tsh proxy db` with the same port, start the
        app. Verify that the app doesn't crash and the db connection tab shows you the error
        (address in use) and offers a way to retry creating the connection.
         - Verify that this works on:

      - Verify that after successfully logging in:
         - [ ] The cluster info is synced.
         - [ ] The first connection wasn't dropped; try executing `select now();`, the client should
           be able to automatically reinstantiate the connection.
         - [ ] The database proxy is able to handle new connections; click "Run" in the db tab and
           see if it connects without problems. You might need to resync the cluster again in case
           they managed to expire.
      - [ ] Verify that closing the login modal without logging in shows an appropriate error.
   - Log in, create a db connection, then remove access to that db server for that user; wait for
     the cert to expire, then attempt to make a connection through the proxy; log in.
      - [ ] Verify that psql shows an appropriate access denied error ("access to db denied. User
        does not have permissions. Confirm database user and name").

     through CLI. While the login modal is shown, make a headless request. Verify that after logging
     in again, the app shows the modal for the headless request.
- Per-session MFA
   - The easiest way to test it is to enable [cluster-wide per-session
     MFA](https://goteleport.com/docs/access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa/#cluster-wide).
   - [ ] Verify that connecting to a Kube cluster prompts for MFA.

        verify that Kube access is working with MFA.
   - [ ] Verify that Connect prompts for MFA during Connect My Computer setup.
- Connect My Computer
   - [ ] Verify the happy path from clean slate (no existing role) setup: set up the node and then
     connect to it.
   - Kill the agent while its joining the cluster and verify that the logs from the agent process
     are shown in the UI.
      - The easiest way to do this is by following the agent cleanup daemon logs (`tail -F ~/Library/Application\ Support/Teleport\
        Connect/logs/cleanup.log`) and then `kill -s KILL <agent PID>`.
      - [ ] During setup.
      - [ ] After setup in the status view. Verify that the page says that the process exited with
        SIGKILL.
   - [ ] Open the node config, change the proxy address to an incorrect one to simulate problems
     with connection. Verify that the app kills the agent after the agent is not able to join the
     cluster within the timeout.
   - [ ] Verify autostart behavior. The agent should automatically start on app start unless it was
     manually stopped before exiting the app.
   - Verify that all items from this section work on:
      - [ ] macOS
      - [ ] Windows
      - [ ] Linux

- [ ] Log in to a cluster, then log out and log in again as a different user. Verify that the app
  works properly after that.
- [ ] Clean the Application Support dir for Connect. Start the latest stable version of the app.
  Open every possible document. Close the app. Start the current alpha. Reopen the tabs. Verify that
  the app was able to reopen the tabs without any errors.
