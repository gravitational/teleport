You can use Teleport to provide secure access to your cloud provider's APIs.
This means that you can prevent unauthorized usage of management consoles and
CLI tools with the same RBAC system you use to protect your infrastructure.

Teleport's granular audit logging allows you to easily correlate access to
your cloud providers with changes in your infrastructure. And with Just-in-Time
Access Requests, your teams can get the access they need to modify cloud
resources for only as long as they need it, leaving attackers with no
longstanding admin accounts to target.
