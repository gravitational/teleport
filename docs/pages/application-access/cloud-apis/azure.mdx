title: "Protect Azure CLIs with Teleport Application Access"
description: How to enable secure access to Azure CLIs.
---

You can use Teleport to manage access to CLI tools that interact with Azure's
APIs. This lets you control access to your infrastructure's management APIs
using the same RBAC system that you use to protect your infrastructure itself.

The Teleport Application Service uses Azure managed identities to obtain
authentication tokens from Azure. When a user authenticates to Teleport, they
can assume one of these managed identities to execute Azure CLI commands.

You can configure which Teleport users or roles have access to specific Azure
identities, giving you control over who can obtain credentials for different
levels of access to Azure CLIs.

The Teleport Application Service connects to the Teleport Proxy Service over a
reverse tunnel, so you can run the Application Service in a private network and
prevent unauthorized access to your organization's Azure identities. 

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- The `az` CLI tool installed on your workstation. Teleport's `tsh` client uses
  the `az` binary to execute commands. See the [Azure
  documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
  for how to install the `az` CLI on your operating system.

- An Azure VM where you will run the Teleport Application Service. The Azure VM
  must be running a Linux distribution.

- The ability to create a user-assigned Azure managed identity and attach it to
  your VM. Azure requires three role assignments in your Azure account in order
  to do this: Managed Identity Contributor, Managed Identity Operator, and
  Virtual Machine Contributor. 

  <Admonition type="tip" title="Using existing identities">

  In this guide, we will create a user-assigned managed identity to demonstrate
  Azure CLI access with Teleport. 

  If you have another identity you would like Azure CLI users to assume via
  Teleport, you can use that instead. In this case, you will not need the
  Managed Identity Contributor role assignment.

  </Admonition>

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Grant an identity to your VM

In this step, we will create an Azure managed identity and assign it to your
Azure VM. The identity we will create will be called `teleport-azure`, and will
have permissions to view resources in your Azure account.

You can enable Teleport to grant access to Azure CLIs under any Azure identity.
If you have another one you intend to use, you can skip the creation of a new
identity.

### Create an Azure managed identity

Visit the [Managed
Identities](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity%2FuserAssignedIdentities)
view in Azure Portal.

Click **Create**.

Under **Subscription**, **Resource group**, and **Region**, choose the ones that
your VM belongs to.

In the **Name** field, enter `teleport-azure`.

![Creating an Azure managed
identity](../../../img/application-access/azure/create-identity.png)

Click **Review + create**, then **Create**.

Once creation finishes, click **Go to resource**. On the page for the new
identity, click **JSON View**. At the top of the right sidebar, you will see a
field called **Resource ID** with a value resembling the following:

```
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure
```

Copy the URI of this identity so you can use it later in this guide.

### Allow the `teleport-azure` identity to view resources

Once you create an Azure identity, authorize it to access resources in your
account. In this case, we will authorize your new Azure identity to view
resources in its resource group.

Enter the name of your Azure resource group in the Azure Portal search box and
visit the page for that resource group. On the left navigation sidebar, click
the **Access control (IAM)** tab. In the row of buttons at the top of the
**Access control (IAM)** panel, click **Add > Add role assignment**.

Within the **Add role assignment** screen, click **Reader**, a built-in role
with view-only access to resources. 

![Add a role
assignment](../../../img/application-access/azure/add-role-assignment.png)

Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click **Next**.

Within the **Members** tab, in the **Assign access to** field, choose **Managed
identity**. Click **Select members**.

On the right sidebar, find the **Managed identity** dropdown menu and select
**User-assigned managed identity**. Choose the `teleport-azure` identity you
created earlier. 

![Select managed
identities](../../../img/application-access/azure/select-managed-identities.png)

Click **Select**, then **Review + assign**.

Verify that your **Role** is "Reader", the **Scope** matches your chosen
resource group, and the **Members** field includes the `teleport-azure` managed
identity you created earlier.

Click **Review + assign** again.

### Attach an identity to your Azure VM

Now that you have created a managed identity and assigned it a role, attach the
identity to your Azure VM so the Teleport Application Service can assume the
identity in order to proxy Azure CLI traffic.

In the [Virtual machines
view](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines)
of Azure Portal, click on the name of the VM you are using to host the Teleport
Application Service. 

On the right side panel, click the **Identity** tab, then within the
**Identity** view, click the **User assigned** tab. Click **+Add**, then select
the `teleport-azure` identity. Click **Add**.

![Add an identity to a
VM](../../../img/application-access/azure/vm-identity.png)

Navigate back to **Identity** tab in the page for your Azure VM. You should see
the new identity listed in the **User assigned** sub-tab:

![Verifying that you added the
identity](../../../img/application-access/azure/verify-id.png)

## Step 2/4. Deploy the Teleport Application Service

In this step, you will run the Teleport Application Service on the Azure VM you
assigned the `teleport-azure` identity to. 

(!docs/pages/includes/application-access/app-service-join-token.mdx!)

### Install the Teleport Application Service

Run the following commands on the host where you will install the Teleport
Application Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Configure the Teleport Application Service

On the host where you will run the Teleport Application Service, create a file
at `/etc/teleport.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "teleport.example.com:443"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
app_service:
  enabled: true
  apps:
  - name: azure-cli
    cloud: Azure
```

Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` to replace `teleport.example.com:443` with the host
and port of your Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Cloud tenant, e.g.,
`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

The `app_service` field configures the Teleport Application Service. Each item
within `app_service.apps` is an application configuration. 

In this example, we have enabled Azure CLI access by setting `cloud` to `Azure`.
With this setting configured, the Application Service will proxy user commands
from Azure CLIs by requesting access to Azure's APIs under the user's chosen
identity, which works as long as the identity is one of the ones attached to the
Application Service host.

### Run the Teleport Application Service

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport Application Service"!)

## Step 3/4. Enable your user to access Azure CLIs

The next step is to authorize your Teleport user to assume an Azure identity and
execute Azure CLI commands via Teleport. You will protect access to this
identity using Teleport's RBAC system, where a user's roles determine which
Azure managed identities (if any) they can access.

There are two approaches you can take to authorize users to access Azure
identities.

|Approach|Description|Supported User Types|
|---|---|---|
|**Dynamic**|A Teleport role includes a template variable that grants a user access to all Azure identities assigned directly to them.|Local users, OIDC, SAML|
|**Static**|A Teleport role explicitly specifies the Azure identities a user is allowed to assume.|Local users, OIDC, SAML, GitHub|

<Notice type="tip">

We recommend using the dynamic approach, since it scales more easily as you add
Azure identities to your account. If you have configured a Teleport Community Edition
cluster to authenticate users using GitHub SSO, you must use the static approach,
as OAuth-based GitHub applications do not support custom claims.

</Notice>

<Tabs dropdownCaption="Approach">
<TabItem options="Dynamic Identities" label="Local Users">

Create a file called `azure-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - '{{internal.azure_identities}}'
```

When a user with the `azure-cli-access` role authenticates to an Azure CLI via
Teleport, the Teleport Auth Service populates the
`{{internal.azure_identities}}` template variable with any Azure identities you
have assigned to the user.

Assign the `teleport-azure` identity to your Teleport user by running the
following command, pasting in the URI of the Azure identity you copied earlier
as the value of `--set-azure-identities`:

```code
$ tctl users update <Var name="teleport-user" /> \
--set-azure-identities <Var name="azure-identity-uri" />
```

This command uses the `--set-azure-identities` flag to add Azure identities to a
user. You can assign `--set-azure-identities` to multiple identity URIs,
separated by commas.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f azure-cli-access.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem options="Dynamic Identities" label="SAML/OIDC Connectors">

In your identity provider, define a custom SAML attribute or OIDC claim called
`azure_identities`. Each user's `azure_identities` attribute or claim must be a
list of Azure identity URIs, using the following format:

```text
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/IDENTITY_NAME
```

Create a file called `azure-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - '{{external.azure_identities}}'
```

When a user with the `azure-cli-access` role authenticates to an Azure CLI via
Teleport, the Teleport Auth Service populates the
`{{external.azure_identities}}` template variable with any Azure identities you
have assigned to the user.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f azure-cli-access.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem options="Static Identities" label="All Authentication Methods">

Define a role with access to specific Azure identities, which means that
Teleport users who assume this role can use those (and only those) identities to
execute commands via an Azure CLI.

Create a file called `azure-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure
```

Edit the identity URI in the `azure_identities` field to match the one you
copied in Step 1.

This role grants a user access to any Teleport-registered application, such as
the `azure-cli` application we defined earlier, and allows that user to assume
the `teleport-azure` identity you created earlier.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f azure-cli-access.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Details title="Denying access to Azure identities">

You can define a Teleport role that denies a user access to one or more Azure
identities. To do so, assign values to the `azure_identities` field within the
`spec.deny` section of a `role` resource. 

For example, this role denies the user access to all Azure identities:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: "no-azure-identities"
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
  deny:
    azure_identities:
      - '*'
```

The `no-azure-identities` role enables the user to access all registered
applications, but makes use of the wildcard character (`*`) within the
`deny.azure_identities` field to prevent the user from assuming any Azure
identity. 

Unlike values of `allow.azure_identities`, values of `deny.azure_identities` can
include wildcard expressions in addition to the URIs of specific Azure
identities.

The Teleport Auth Service gives `deny` rules precedence over `allow` rules when
evaluating a user's roles.

</Details>

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="azure-cli-access"!)

## Step 4/4. Use Azure CLIs with Teleport

Now that you have authorized your Teleport user to assume the `teleport-azure`
identity, you can use Teleport to authenticate to Azure's APIs and execute
commands against it via the `az` CLI.

### List your Azure CLI application

Verify that your Teleport user can see the `azure-cli` application you
registered earlier:

```code
$ tsh apps ls
Application Description Type Public Address                 Labels
----------- ----------- ---- ------------------------------ -------------------
azure-cli               HTTP azure-cli.teleport.example.com teleport.dev/origin
```

### Log in to use an Azure CLI

Log in to the application, specifying that you would like to assume the
`teleport-azure` identity:

```code
$ tsh apps login azure-cli --azure-identity teleport-azure
```

This command validates the value of the `--azure-identity` flag against the ones
the user is authorized to assume. The value of the flag can either be the full
URI of the identity (e.g., the URI you copied earlier in this guide) or the name
of the identity, e.g., `teleport-azure`. 

A user can omit the `--azure-identity` flag if they are only authorized to
access a single Azure identity, but otherwise an empty `--azure-identity` will
result in an error.

If the command succeeds, you will see information about the user's chosen Azure
identity similar to the following:

```text
[
  {
    "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Microsoft Azure Sponsorship",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "user": {
      "assignedIdentityInfo": "MSIResource-/subscriptions/0000000000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure",
      "name": "userAssignedIdentity",
      "type": "servicePrincipal"
    }
  }
]

Logged into Azure app "azure-cli".
Your identity: /subscriptions/0000000000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure
Example Azure CLI command: tsh az vm list
```

### Execute Azure CLI commands

At this point, you can run `az` commands using the Teleport Application Service
by prefixing them with `tsh`. To list VMs running in your Azure resource group,
for example, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh az vm list
```

<Notice type="tip">

If you're not seeing the expected VMs at this point, double-check that your
Azure managed identity is assigned the "Reader" role at the scope of your
resource group.

</Notice>

### Use Azure CLI applications without `tsh`

In addition to running `az` commands via `tsh`, you can grant secure access to
any CLI application that executes commands against Azure's APIs.

To do this, use `tsh` to start a local proxy that forwards traffic from your CLI
application to the Teleport Application Service. The Application Service uses an
Azure managed identity to fetch an authentication token from Azure, which your
CLI application uses to authenticate requests to Azure's APIs.

To start the local proxy, run the following `tsh` command:

```code
$ tsh proxy azure 
```

<Notice type="tip">

The command `tsh proxy az` is an alias for `tsh proxy azure`.

</Notice>

The command will print the address of the local proxy server along with `export`
commands for assigning environment variables. Azure CLI applications read these
variables in order to request an authentication token for Azure's APIs:

```text
Started Azure proxy on http://127.0.0.1:54330.
To avoid port randomization, you can choose the listening port using the --port flag.

Use the following credentials and HTTPS proxy setting to connect to the proxy:

  export AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=/Users/myuser/.tsh/azure/my.teleport.cluster/azure
  export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:54330
  export HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:54330
  export MSI_ENDPOINT=https://azure-msi.teleport.dev/eedfd5b55257c0aaa58f
  export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/Users/myuser/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/myuser-app/teleport.example.com/azure-cli-localca.pem
```

<Notice type="warning">

`tsh proxy azure` runs the local proxy in the foreground, so don't interrupt
the process or exit the terminal where you ran the command until you're ready
to close the local proxy.

</Notice>

Copy the `export` commands and paste them into a second terminal. In that
terminal, you can now run your Azure CLI application of choice. For example, you
can run the following command to list Azure VMs:

```code
$ az vm list
```

Since the `az` CLI requests an authentication token using the `teleport-azure`
identity you created earlier, and that identity is authorized to view resources
in your resource group, the `az vm list` command will only list VMs in that
resource group.

<Notice type="info">

When you run an `az` command via `tsh az`, `tsh` starts the local proxy in the
background and uses it to execute the command.

</Notice>
