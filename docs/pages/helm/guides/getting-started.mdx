title: Getting started with the Teleport Helm chart repository
description: How to install and configure the Gravitational Teleport Helm chart repository
---

This guide will get you started with being able to set up Teleport using our official Helm charts.

# Installing Helm

Teleport's charts require the use of Helm version 3. You can [install Helm 3 by following these instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

Throughout this guide, we will assume that you have the `helm` binary available in your `PATH`:

```shell
$ which helm
/usr/local/bin/helm
$ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.4.1", GitCommit:"c4e74854886b2efe3321e185578e6db9be0a6e29", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.14.11"}
```

# Adding the Teleport Helm chart repository

To allow Helm to install charts which are hosted in the Teleport Helm repository, you should add the repository using `helm repo add`:

```shell
$ helm repo add teleport https://charts.releases.teleport.dev
"teleport" has been added to your repositories
```

Once installed, you can search repositories for charts using the `helm repo search` command:

```shell
$ helm repo search teleport

```

To update the cache of charts from the remote repository, run `helm repo update`:

```shell
$ helm repo update
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "teleport" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
```

## Teleport Charts hosted by the repository

The Teleport Helm repository hosts two Helm charts:

- `teleport-cluster` [(README on Github)](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/chart/teleport-cluster)
- `teleport-kube-agent` [(README on Github)](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/chart/teleport-kube-agent)

### teleport-cluster

The `teleport-cluster` Helm chart is used to configure a Teleport cluster. It runs two services:

- The [Teleport auth service](./architecture/authentication), which authenticates users and hosts, and issues certificates
- The [Teleport proxy service](./architecture/proxy), which runs the externally-facing parts of a Teleport cluster, such as the web UI, SSH proxy and reverse tunnel service.

The `teleport-cluster` chart can be deployed in four different modes - `standalone`, `aws`, `gcp` and `ownconfig`.

We have a guide for each mode:

- [`standalone` - Simple one-node Teleport cluster](./helm/guides/standalone)
- [`aws` - Using DynamoDB for database/audit log and S3 for session logs](./helm/guides/aws)
- ['gcp'- Using Google Firestore for database/audit log and Google storage for session logs](./helm/guides/gcp)
- [`ownconfig` - Provide your own custom Teleport config for more esoteric configurations](./helm/guides/ownconfig)
