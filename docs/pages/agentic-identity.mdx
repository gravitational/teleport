The Teleport Agentic Identity Framework is a standards-driven security
architecture and a reference implementation for deploying AI agents across
infrastructure. It provides designs and reference implementations for safe agent
adoption across infrastructure with built-in security invariants, observability,
and governance. The framework is architected for the pace and scale of AI,
enabling engineers to integrate security into agentic systems from the initial
design phase.

As with the AI ecosystem as a whole, the Teleport Agentic Identity Framework is
under development. Each component includes one of the following status
categories:

- **Ready:** Available for production use.
- **Development:** Partially complete.
- **Planned:** Not yet it development, but on the roadmap.

## Agentic Identity

You can use Teleport to issue and manage cryptographic identities for agents,
including delegated identities and identities for long-running agents across all
of your infrastructure.

Teleport includes the following capabilities for Agentic Identity:

|Feature|Status|
