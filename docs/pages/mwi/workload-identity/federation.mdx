title: SPIFFE Federation
description: An overview of the Teleport Workload Identity SPIFFE Federation feature.
---

Federation allows a relationship to be established between your Teleport
Workload Identity trust domain and another trust domain, enabling workloads
within the two trust domains to validate each other's identities. This can be
used to allow workloads within different environments or different organizations
to communicate securely.

SPIFFE sets out a standard for federation that allows trust domains managed by
different implementations to federate with one another. For example, a trust
domain managed by Teleport Workload Identity could federate with a trust domain
managed by SPIRE.

The SPIFFE Federation process relies on the exchange of trust bundles between
the trust domains. These trust bundles contain the certificates and public keys
of the trust domain's issuer that are required to validate the identities that
it has issued.

Federation relationships are "one way" meaning that workloads within one trust
domain can validate the identities of workloads in the other trust domain, but
workloads in the other trust domain cannot validate the identities of workloads
in the first trust domain. It is therefore typical to establish the federation
relationship in both directions.

SPIFFE Federation support was introduced in Teleport version 16.3.0. Both your
Teleport Auth Service and tbot agent must be running at least this version.

## Federation to Teleport Workload Identity

This section discusses how to configure another trust domain to trust a Teleport
Workload Identity hosted trust domain.

In order to configure a trust domain to trust Teleport Workload Identity, the
control plane of the trust domain must be able to access the SPIFFE Bundle
Endpoint exposed on the Teleport Proxy Service.

The Teleport Workload Identity SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint implements the "https_web"
profile as defined by the SPIFFE Federation specification. This means that the
endpoint is served using the standard web TLS certificates configured for your
Teleport Proxy.

The SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint is exposed on the Teleport Proxy Service at the path
`/webapi/spiffe/bundle.json`.

## Federation from Teleport Workload Identity

This section discusses how to configure a Teleport Workload Identity hosted
trust domain to trust another trust domain.

Teleport Workload Identity only supports federating with trust domains that
offer a SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint that abides by the "https_web" profile as defined
by the SPIFFE Federation specification.

The `spiffe_federation` resource configures a trust relationship between the
Teleport Workload Identity trust domain and a remote trust domain.

For example, to federate with a trust domain named `example.com` that has a
SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint at `https://example.com/spiffe/bundle.json`, you would
create a `spiffe_federation` resource like so:

```yaml
kind: spiffe_federation
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example.com
spec:
  bundle_source:
    https_web:
      bundle_endpoint_url: https://example.com/spiffe/bundle.json
```

A background process will periodically fetch the trust bundle from the remote
trust domain according to the refresh hint provided by the remote trust domain.

You can check the status of the federation relationship using the `tctl` CLI:

```code
$ tctl get spiffe_federation/example.com
```

This will show the last fetched bundle, the time it was fetched, and the time
that the next fetch is scheduled.

Once the resource has been created and has successfully been synced, `tbot`
will begin to serve the federated trust bundle to your workloads via the
Workload API.
