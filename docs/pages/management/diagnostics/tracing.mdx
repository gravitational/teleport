description: How to enable tracing within Teleport.

Teleport leverages [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to generate traces
and export them to any [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/otlp/)
capable exporter. In the event that your telemetry backend doesn't support receiving OTLP traces, you may be able to
leverage the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to proxy traces from OTLP
to a format that your telemetry backend accepts.

## Configure Teleport

In order to enable tracing in Teleport, add the following section in `teleport.yaml`. For a detailed description of
these configuration fields, see the [configuration reference](./reference/configuration.mdx) page.

<Details title="Tracing Service Configuration" min="8.3.18,9.3.15,10.1">
```yaml
tracing_service:
   enabled: yes
   exporter_url: grpc://collector.example.com:4317
   sampling_rate_per_million: 1000000
```
</Details>

It is important to choose the sampling rate wisely. Sampling at a rate of 100% could have a negative impact on the
performance of your cluster. Teleport honors the parent span's sampling rate, which means that even when the
`tracing_service` is enabled and the sampling rate is 0, if Teleport receives a request that has a span which is
sampled, then Teleport will sample and exports all spans that are generated in response to that request.

After updating `teleport.yaml`, start Teleport as usual using `teleport start`.

## tsh

To capture traces from `tsh` simply add the `--trace` flag to your command. All traces generated by `tsh --trace` will be
proxied to the `exporter_url` defined for the Auth Service of the cluster the command is being run on.

```code
$ tsh --trace ssh root@myserver
$ tsh --trace ls
```
