title: Upgrading the Teleport Binary
description: How to upgrade a teleport binary without sacrificing availability.
---

In this guide, we will show you how to upgrade the `teleport` binary on a Linux
host without sacrificing availability.

<Details title="Using containers?">

If you are running `teleport` as a container, see
[How to Run Teleport Using Docker](../../installation.mdx#docker) for information on
specifying a version.

</Details>

## Prerequisites

This guide requires a host where the `teleport` binary is running. The version
of the binary must be behind the latest.
 
For Teleport major version `(=teleport.major_version=)` the latest version is `(=teleport.version=)`.
Compare this to the version of Teleport you have installed on the host:

```code
$ teleport version
Teleport v8.3.7 git:v8.3.7-0-ga8d066935 go1.17.3
  ```

## Step 1/3. Download a new Teleport binary

Preserve the old binary, just in case the upgrade goes wrong.

```code
$ DIR=$(which teleport | xargs dirname)
$ sudo mv ${DIR}/teleport ${DIR}/teleport.bak
```

Install the newest version of Teleport on the host:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/3. Fork the `teleport` process

Fork a new `teleport` process by sending it the `USR2` signal:

```code
$ sudo kill -USR2 $(pidof teleport)
```

The original `teleport` process forked a new child process and passed existing file descriptors
to the child. You now have two processes handling requests on the same socket:

```code
$ pidof teleport
# 235276 235119
```

In our example, `235276` is a PID of the child process, and `235119` is a PID of the parent.

<Details type="tip" title="Not sure which process is the parent?">

You can use the following command, which prints the parent for each PID returned
by `pidof`:

```code
$ ps -o ppid= -p $(pidof teleport)
   1494
   1495
```

</Details>

In the logs you will see that the parent process reports that it has forked a new child
process, and the child accepts file descriptors from its parent.

```txt
2021-08-19T10:16:51-07:00 [PROC:1]  INFO Forked new child process. path:/usr/local/teleport service/signals.go:457
2021-08-19T10:16:51-07:00 [PROC:1]  INFO Using file descriptor diag 127.0.0.1:3434 passed by the parent process. service/signals.go:207
```

## Step 3/3. Return to a single `teleport` process

After forking the new `teleport` process, check the logs to ensure that the
process is running as expected. After that, you should either roll back or
complete the upgrade:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Rollback">
  If the new binary behaves with errors, shut down the child process:
  ```code
  $ sudo kill -TERM 235276
  2022-04-20T15:33:58Z INFO [PROC:1]    Got signal "terminated", exiting immediately. service/signals.go:86
  2022-04-20T15:33:58Z WARN [PROC:1]    Forked teleport process 235276 has exited with status: 0. service/signals.go:506
  ```
  
  <Admonition
  type="danger"
  title="WARNING"
  >

    Do not forget to restore the original binary
    ```code
    $ sudo mv ${DIR}/teleport.bak ${DIR}/teleport
    ```
  </Admonition>
    
  You can retry the process again later.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Finish the upgrade">

  <Admonition
    type="danger"
    title="WARNING"
  >

    If you are upgrading a `teleport` daemon using an SSH connection established
    via Teleport, make sure to connect to the newly upgraded `teleport` process
    and shut down the previous `teleport` process from it.
    
    You can see which `teleport` process handles the connection by using
    `pstree`:

    ```code
    $ pstree -aps $$
    # systemd,1 splash
    #  └─systemd,6247 --user
    #      └─teleport-,235276
    #          └─bash,190718
    #              └─pstree,242371 -aps 190718
    ```

  </Admonition>
     
    Shut down the parent process gracefully using `SIGQUIT`:

    ```code
    $ sudo kill -QUIT 235119
    ```

    The parent process will log a graceful shutdown:

    ```txt
    2021-08-19T10:32:10-07:00 INFO [PROXY:SER] Shutting down gracefully. service/service.go:2952
    ```

    In a couple of minutes, all existing connections drain off and the parent will exit:

    ```code
    $ pidof teleport
    # 235276
    ```
    
    If for some reason, the parent process gets stuck (e.g., waiting for
    existing connections to finish), you can shut it down non-gracefully:

    ```code
    $ sudo kill -TERM 235119
    ```

    You are all set.
