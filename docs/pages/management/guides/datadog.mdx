h1: Export Teleport metrics and logs to Datadog
---

Datadog has an [officially maintained integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/teleport/) for Teleport.

The integration exports both metrics and logs to Datadog. The metrics are Datadog-native,
not external metrics, which means they incur no extra usage charges to your Datadog account.
The integration also includes a dashboard for monitoring your Teleport cluster.

There is no installation required to use the integration, only changes to the Datadog
Agent configuration. Please see the Datadog documentation linked above for how to activate
the Teleport integration in Datadog.
