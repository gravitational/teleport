This guide will explain how to:

- Set up Teleport's Terraform provider on Linux and Mac.
- Configure Teleport users and roles using the Terraform provider.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

Create a folder called `teleport-terraform` to hold some temporary files:

```code
$ mkdir -p teleport-terraform
$ cd teleport-terraform
```

## Step 1/3. Create Teleport credentials for Terraform

Terraform needs a signed identity file from your Teleport cluster's certificate
authority in order to manage resources in the cluster.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Running Terraform from a CI/CD platform?">
If you intend to run Terraform from a CI/CD platform,
[Machine ID](../../machine-id/introduction.mdx) is often a better option for
generating credentials. Machine ID can provision short-lived certificates for
CI/CD workflows as opposed to manually generating impersonated credentials with
a long TTL.
</Admonition>

### Create the Terraform user

Create a local Teleport user named `terraform`, and a matching role granting the
necessary permissions for Terraform to manage resources in your cluster.

Put the following content into `terraform.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: terraform
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    rules:
      - resources:
        - app
        - cluster_auth_preference
        - cluster_networking_config
        - db
        - github
        - oidc
        - role
        - saml
        - session_recording_config
        - token
        - trusted_cluster
        - user
        - login_rule
        verbs: ['list','create','read','update','delete']
version: v6
---
kind: user
metadata:
  name: terraform
spec:
  roles: ['terraform']
version: v2
```

Create the `terraform` user and role.

```code
$ tctl create terraform.yaml
```

### Enable impersonation

The `terraform` user cannot log in to get credentials, another user must
**impersonate** this account in order to request a certificate.

Create a role that enables your user to impersonate the Terraform user. First, paste
the following YAML document into a file called `terraform-impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: terraform-impersonator
spec:
  allow:
    # This impersonate rule will allow any user with this role to impersonate
    # and generate certificates for the user named "terraform" with a role also
    # named "terraform".
    impersonate:
      users: ['terraform']
      roles: ['terraform']
```

Next, create the role:

```code
$ tctl create terraform-impersonator.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="terraform-impersonator"!)

Next, request a signed identity file for the Terraform user:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user=terraform --out=terraform-identity
```

This command should result in one file: `terraform-identity`.

## Step 2/3. Create a Terraform configuration

Paste the following into a file called `main.tf` to define an example user and
role using Terraform.

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">
```
(!examples/resources/terraform/terraform-user-role-cloud.tf!)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">
```
(!examples/resources/terraform/terraform-user-role-self-hosted.tf!)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Apply the configuration

Check the contents of the `teleport-terraform` folder:

```code
$ ls
# main.tf  terraform-identity  terraform-impersonator.yaml  terraform.yaml
```

Init terraform and apply the spec:

```code
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```

## Next Steps

- Find the full list of [supported Terraform provider resources](../../reference/terraform-provider.mdx).
- Read more about [impersonation](../../access-controls/guides/impersonation.mdx).
