title: Export Teleport Audit Events with Datadog
description: How to configure the Teleport Event Handler plugin and Fluentd to send audit logs to Datadog
---

Datadog is a SAAS monitoring and security platform. In this guide, we'll explain
how to forward Teleport audit events to Datadog using Fluentd.

The Teleport Event Handler is designed to communicate with Fluentd using mTLS
to establish a secure channel. In this setup, the Event Handler sends events to Fluentd, which forwards them to Datadog using an API key to authenticate.

![Architecture of the setup shown in this guide](../../../img/management/datadog-diagram.png)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/plugin-prerequisites.mdx!)

- A [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) account.
- A server, virtual machine, Kubernetes cluster, or Docker environment to run the
  Event Handler. The instructions below assume a local Docker container for testing.
- Fluentd version v(=fluentd.version=) or greater. The Teleport Event Handler
  will create a new `fluent.conf` file you can integrate into an existing Fluentd
  system, or use with a fresh setup.

The instructions below demonstrate a local test of the Event Handler plugin on
your workstation. You will need to adjust paths, ports, and domains for other
environments.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/6. Install the Event Handler plugin

The Teleport event handler runs alongside the Fluentd forwarder, receives events
from Teleport's events API, and forwards them to Fluentd.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-event-handler.mdx!)

## Step 2/6. Generate a plugin configuration

(!docs/pages/includes/configure-event-handler.mdx!)

## Step 3/6. Create a user and role for reading audit events

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/event-handler-role-user.mdx!)

## Step 4/6. Create teleport-event-handler credentials

### Enable issuing of credentials for the Event Handler role

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Machine ID">
(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/rbac-impersonate-event-handler-machine-id.mdx!)
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Long-lived identity files">
(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/rbac-impersonate-event-handler.mdx!)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Export an identity file for the Event Handler plugin user

Give the plugin access to a Teleport identity file. We recommend using Machine
ID for this in order to produce short-lived identity files that are less
dangerous if exfiltrated, though in demo deployments, you can generate
longer-lived identity files with `tctl`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Machine ID">
(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/tbot-identity.mdx secret="teleport-event-handler-identity"!)
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Long-lived identity files">
(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/identity-export.mdx user="teleport-event-handler" secret="teleport-event-handler-identity"!)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 5/6. Install Fluentd output plugin for Datadog

In order for Fluentd to communicate with Datadog, it requires the [Fluentd output
plugin for Datadog](https://github.com/DataDog/fluent-plugin-datadog). Install
the plugin on your Fluentd host using either `gem` or the `td-agent`, if installed:

```code
# Using Gem
$ gem install fluent-plugin-datadog

# Using td-agent
$ /usr/sbin/td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-datadog
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Testing Locally?">

If you're running Fluentd in a local Docker container for testing, you can adjust
the entrypoint to an interactive shell as the root user, so you can install the
plugin before starting Fluentd:

```code
$ docker run -u $(id -u root):$(id -g root) -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/keys -v \
$(pwd)/fluent.conf:/fluentd/etc/fluent.conf --entrypoint=/bin/sh -i --tty  fluent/fluentd:edge
# From the container shell:
$ gem install fluent-plugin-datadog
$ fluentd -c /fluentd/etc/fluent.conf
```

</Admonition>

### Configure Fluentd for Datadog

From the Datadog web UI, generate an API key for Fluentd. From **Organization Settings** -> Access -> **API Keys**, click on **+ New Key**:

![Datadog API key generation](../../../img/management/datadog-generate-api.png)

Copy the API key, and use it to add a new `<match>` block to `fluent.conf`:

```ini
<match test.log>

  @type datadog
  @id awesome_agent
  api_key (=presets.tokens.first=)

  host http-intake.logs.us5.datadoghq.com

  # Optional parameters
  dd_source teleport

</match>
```

- Add your API key to the `api_key` field.
- Adjust the `host` value to match your Datadog site. See their [Log Collection
  and Integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/?tab=host) guide
  to determine the correct value.
- `dd_source` is an optional field you can use to filter these logs in the
  Datadog UI.
- Adjust `ca_path`, `cert_path` and `private_key_path` to point to the credential
  files generated earlier. If you're testing locally, the Docker command above
  already mounted the current working directory to `keys/` in the container.

Restart Fluentd after saving the changes to `fluent.conf`.

## Step 6/6. Run the Teleport Event Handler plugin

### Configure the Event Handler

In this section, you will configure the Teleport Event Handler for your
environment.

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/finish-event-handler-config.mdx!)

Next, modify the configuration file as follows:

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/config-toml-teleport.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/machine-id-exporter-config.mdx!)

### Start the Teleport Event Handler

(!docs/pages/includes/start-event-handler.mdx!)

The Logs view in Datadog should now report your Teleport cluster events:

![Datadog Logs](../../../img/management/datadog-logs.png)

## Troubleshooting connection issues

If the Teleport Event Handler is displaying error logs while connecting to your
Teleport Cluster, ensure that:

- The certificate the Teleport Event Handler is using to connect to your
  Teleport cluster is not past its expiration date. This is the value of the
  `--ttl` flag in the `tctl auth sign` command, which is 12 hours by default.
- Ensure that in your Teleport Event Handler configuration file
  (`teleport-event-handler.toml`), you have provided the correct host *and* port
  for the Teleport Proxy Service.

## Next steps

- Read more about
[impersonation](../../access-controls/guides/impersonation.mdx)
here.
- While this guide uses the `tctl auth sign` command to issue credentials for the
Teleport Event Handler, production clusters should use Machine ID for safer,
more reliable renewals. Read [our guide](../../machine-id/getting-started.mdx)
to getting started with Machine ID.
- To see all of the options you can set in the values file for the
`teleport-plugin-event-handler` Helm chart, consult our [reference
guide](../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-plugin-event-handler.mdx).
- Review the Fluentd output plugin for Datadog [README
file](https://github.com/DataDog/fluent-plugin-datadog/blob/master/README.md)
to learn how to customize the log format entering Datadog.
