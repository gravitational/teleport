description: "How to configure Teleport's Event Handler plugin to send audit events to the Elastic Stack"
---

Teleport's Event Handler plugin receives audit events from the Teleport Auth
Service and forwards them to your log management solution, letting you perform
historical analysis, detect unusual behavior, and form a better understanding of
how users interact with your Teleport cluster.

In this guide, we will show you how to configure Teleport's Event Handler plugin
to send your Teleport audit events to the Elastic Stack. In this setup, the
Event Handler plugin forwards audit events from Teleport to Logstash, which
stores them in Elasticsearch for visualization and alerting in Kibana. 

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- Logstash version 8.4.1 or above running on a Linux host. Logstash must be
  listening on a TCP port that is open to traffic from <ScopedBlock
  scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>the Teleport Auth
  Service</ScopedBlock><ScopedBlock scope="cloud">your Teleport Cloud
  tenant</ScopedBlock>. In this guide, you will also run the Event Handler
  plugin on this host.

- Elasticsearch and Kibana version 8.4.1 or above, either running via an Elastic
  Cloud account or on your own infrastructure. You will need permissions to
  create and manage users in Elasticsearch.

  We have tested this guide on the Elastic Stack version 8.4.1.

## Step 1/4. Set up the Event Handler plugin

The Event Handler plugin is a binary that runs independently of your Teleport
cluster. It authenticates to your Teleport cluster and Logstash using mutual
TLS. In this section, you will install the Event Handler plugin on the Linux
host where you are running Logstash and generate credentials that the plugin
will use for authentication.

### Install the Event Handler plugin

Follow the instructions for your environment to install the Event Handler
plugin on your Logstash host:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-event-handler.mdx!)

### Generate a starter config file

Generate a configuration file with placeholder values for the Teleport Event
Handler plugin. Later in this guide, we will edit the configuration file for
your environment.

(!docs/pages/includes/configure-event-handler.mdx!)

We'll re-purpose the files generated for Fluentd in our Logstash configuration.

### Define RBAC resources

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/event-handler-role-user.mdx!)

<Details title="Using tctl on the Logstash host?">

If you are running Teleport on your Elastic Stack host, e.g., you are exposing
Kibana's HTTP endpoint via the Teleport Application Service, running the `tctl
create` command above will generate an error similar to the following:

```text
ERROR: tctl must be either used on the auth server or provided with the identity file via --identity flag
```

To avoid this error, create the `teleport-event-handler-role.yaml` file on your
workstation, then sign in to your Teleport cluster and run the `tctl` command
locally.

</Details>

### Enable impersonation of the Event Handler plugin user

In order for the Event Handler plugin to forward events from your Teleport
cluster, it needs signed credentials from the cluster's certificate authority.
The `teleport-event-handler` user cannot request this itself, and requires
another user to **impersonate** this account in order to request credentials.

Create a role that enables your user to impersonate the `teleport-event-handler`
user. First, paste the following YAML document into a file called
`teleport-event-handler-impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: teleport-event-handler-impersonator
spec:
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  # This section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ["teleport-event-handler"]
      roles: ["teleport-event-handler"]
```

Next, create the role:

```code
$ tctl create teleport-event-handler-impersonator.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="teleport-event-handler-impersonator"!)

### Export the access plugin identity

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/identity-export.mdx user="teleport-event-handler"!)

## Step 2/4. Configure a Logstash pipeline

The Event Handler plugin forwards audit logs from Teleport by sending HTTP
requests to a user-configured endpoint. We will define a Logstash pipeline that
handles these requests, extracts logs, and sends them to Elasticsearch.

### Create a role for the Event Handler plugin

Your Logstash pipeline will require permissions to create and manage
Elasticsearch indexes and index lifecycle management policies, plus get
information about your Elasticsearch deployment. Create a role with these
permissions so you can later assign it to the Elasticsearch user you will
create for the Event Handler.

In Kibana, navigate to "Management" > "Roles" and click "Create role". Enter the
name `teleport-plugin` for the new role. Under the "Elasticsearch" section,
under "Cluster privileges", enter `manage_index_templates`, `manage_ilm`, and
`monitor`.

Under "Index privileges", define an entry with `audit-events-*` in the "Indices"
field and `write` and `manage` in the "Privileges" field. Click "Create role".

![Creating an Elasticsearch role](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/elasticsearch/create-role.png)

### Create an Elasticsearch user for the Event Handler

Create an Elasticsearch user that Logstash can authenticate as when making
requests to the Elasticsearch API. 

In Kibana, find the hamburger menu on the upper left and click "Management",
then "Users" > "Create user". Enter `teleport` for the "Username" and provide a
secure password.

Assign the user the `teleport-plugin` role we defined earlier.

### Prepare TLS credentials for Logstash

Later in this guide, your Logstash pipeline will use an HTTP input to receive
audit events from the Teleport Event Handler plugin.

Logstash's HTTP input can only sign certificates with a private key that uses
the unencrypted PKCS #8 format. When you ran `teleport-event-handler configure`
earlier, the command generated an encrypted RSA key. We will convert this key to
PKCS #8.

You will need a password to decrypt the RSA key. To retrieve this, execute the
following command in the directory where you ran `teleport-event-handler
configure`:

```code
$ cat fluent.conf | grep passphrase
private_key_passphrase "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"
```

Convert the encrypted RSA key to an unencrypted PKCS #8 key. The command will
prompt your for the password you retrieved: 

```code
$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in server.key -nocrypt -out pkcs8.key
```

Enable Logstash to read the new key, plus the CA and certificate we generated
earlier:

```code
$ chmod +r pkcs8.key ca.crt server.crt
```

### Define an index template

When the Event Handler plugin sends audit events to Logstash, Logstash needs to
know how to parse these events to forward them to Elasticsearch. You can define
this logic using an index template, which Elasticsearch uses to construct an
index for data it receives.

Create a file called `audit-events.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "index_patterns": ["audit-events-*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {},
    "mappings": {
      "dynamic":"true"
    }
  }
}
```

This index template modifies any index with the pattern `audit-events-*`.
Because it includes the `"dynamic": "true"` setting, it instructs Elasticsearch
to define index fields dynamically based on the events it receives. This is
useful for Teleport audit events, which use a variety of fields depending on
the event type.

### Define a Logstash pipeline

On the host where you are running Logstash, create a configuration file that
defines a Logstash pipeline. This pipeline will receive logs from port `9601`
and forward them to Elasticsearch.

On the host running Logstash, create a file called
`/etc/logstash/conf.d/teleport-audit.conf` with the following content:
 
```ruby
input {
  http {
    port => 9601
    ssl =>  true
    ssl_certificate => "/home/server.crt"
    ssl_key =>  "/home/pkcs8.key"
    ssl_certificate_authorities => [
      "/home/ca.crt"
    ]
    ssl_verify_mode => "force_peer"
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch {
    user => "teleport"
    password => "ELASTICSEARCH_PASSPHRASE"
    template_name => "audit-events"
    template => "/home/audit-events.json"
    index => "audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    template_overwrite => true
  }
}
```

In the `input.http` section, update `ssl_certificate` and
`ssl_certificate_authorities` to include the locations of the server certificate
and certificate authority files that the `teleport-event-handler configure`
command generated earlier. 

Logstash will authenticate client certificates against the CA file and present a
signed certificate to the Teleport Event Handler plugin.

Edit the `ssl_key` field to include the path to the `pkcs8.key` file we
generated earlier.

In the `output.elasticsearch` section, edit the following fields depending on
whether you are using Elastic Cloud or your own Elastic Stack deployment:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Elastic Cloud">

Assign `cloud_auth` to a string with the content `teleport:PASSWORD`, replacing
`PASSWORD` with the password you assigned to your `teleport` user earlier.	

Visit `https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments`, find the "Cloud ID" field, copy
the content, and add it as the value of `cloud_id` in your Logstash pipeline
configuration. The `elasticsearch` section should resemble the following:

```ruby
  elasticsearch {
    cloud_id => "CLOUD_ID"
    cloud_auth => "teleport:PASSWORD" 
    template_name => "audit-events"
    template => "/home/audit-events.json"
    index => "audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    template_overwrite => true
  }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Self-Hosted">

Assign `hosts` to a string indicating the hostname of your Elasticsearch host. 

Assign `user` to `teleport` and `password` to the passphrase you created for
your `teleport` user earlier.

The `elasticsearch` section should resemble the following:

```ruby
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => "elasticsearch.example.com"
    user => "teleport" 
    password => "PASSWORD" 
    template_name => "audit-events"
    template => "/home/audit-events.json"
    index => "audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    template_overwrite => true
  }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, modify `template` to point to the path to the `audit-events.json` file
you created earlier. 

Because the index template we will create with this file applies to indices
with the prefix `audit-events-*`, and we have configured our Logstash pipeline
to create an index with the title `"audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}`, Elasticsearch
will automatically index fields from Teleport audit events.

### Disable the Elastic Common Schema for your pipeline

The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) is a standard set of fields that Elastic Stack
uses to parse and visualize data. Since we are configuring Elasticsearch to
index all fields from your Teleport audit logs dynamically, we will disable the
ECS for your Logstash pipeline.

On the host where you are running Logstash, edit `/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml`
to add the following entry:

```yaml
- pipeline.id: teleport-audit-logs
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/conf.d/teleport-audit.conf"
  pipeline.ecs_compatibility: disabled
```

This disables the ECS for your Teleport audit log pipeline.

<Admonition type="tip">

If your `pipelines.yml` file defines an existing pipeline that includes
`teleport-audit.conf`, e.g., by using a wildcard value in `path.config`, adjust
the existing pipeline definition so it no longer applies to
`teleport-audit.conf`.

</Admonition>

### Run the Logstash pipeline

Restart Logstash:

```code
$ sudo systemctl restart logstash
```

Make sure your Logstash pipeline started successfully by running the following
command to tail Logstash's logs:

```code
$ sudo journalctl -u logstash -f
```

When your Logstash pipeline initializes its `http` input and starts running, you
should see a log similar to this:

```text
Sep 15 18:27:13 myhost logstash[289107]: [2022-09-15T18:27:13,491][INFO ][logstash.inputs.http][main][33bdff0416b6a2b643e6f4ab3381a90c62b3aa05017770f4eb9416d797681024] Starting http input listener {:address=>"0.0.0.0:9601", :ssl=>"true"}
```

These logs indicate that your Logstash pipeline has connected to Elasticsearch
and installed a new index template:

```text
Sep 12 19:49:06 myhost logstash[33762]: [2022-09-12T19:49:06,309][INFO ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch][main] Elasticsearch version determined (8.4.1) {:es_version=>8}
Sep 12 19:50:00 myhost logstash[33762]: [2022-09-12T19:50:00,993][INFO ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch][main] Installing Elasticsearch template {:name=>"audit-events"}
```
<Details title="Pipeline not starting?">

If Logstash fails to initialize the pipeline, it may continue to attempt to
contact Elasticsearch. In that case, you will see repeated logs like the one below:

```text
Sep 12 19:43:04 myhost logstash[33762]: [2022-09-12T19:43:04,519][WARN ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch][main] Attempted to resurrect connection to dead ES instance, but got an error {:url=>"http://teleport:xxxxxx@127.0.0.1:9200/", :exception=>LogStash::Outputs::ElasticSearch::HttpClient::Pool::HostUnreachableError, :message=>"Elasticsearch Unreachable: [http://127.0.0.1:9200/][Manticore::ClientProtocolException] 127.0.0.1:9200 failed to respond"}
```

### Diagnosing the problem

To diagnose the cause of errors initializing your Logstash pipeline, search your
Logstash `journalctl` logs for the following, which indicate that the pipeline is
starting. The relevant error logs should come shortly after these:

```text
Sep 12 18:15:52 myhost logstash[27906]: [2022-09-12T18:15:52,146][INFO][logstash.javapipeline][main] Starting pipeline {:pipeline_id=>"main","pipeline.workers"=>2, "pipeline.batch.size"=>125, "pipeline.batch.delay"=>50,"pipeline.max_inflight"=>250,"pipeline.sources"=>["/etc/logstash/conf.d/teleport-audit.conf"],:thread=>"#<Thread:0x1c1a3ee5 run>"}
Sep 12 18:15:52 myhost logstash[27906]: [2022-09-12T18:15:52,912][INFO][logstash.javapipeline][main] Pipeline Java execution initialization time {"seconds"=>0.76}
```

### Disabling Elasticsearch TLS

This guide assumes that you have already configured Elasticsearch and Logstash
to communicate with one another via TLS. 

If your Elastic Stack deployment is in a sandboxed or low-security environment
(e.g., a demo environment), and your `journalctl` logs for Logstash show that
Elasticsearch is unreachable, you can disable TLS for communication between
Logstash and Elasticsearch.

Edit the file `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` to set
`xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` to `false`, then restart Elasticsearch.

</Details>

## Step 3/4. Run the Event Handler plugin

### Complete the Event Handler configuration

Earlier, we generated a file called `teleport-event-handler.toml` to configure
the Event Handler plugin. This file includes settings similar to the following:

```toml
storage = "./storage"
timeout = "10s"
batch = 20
namespace = "default"

[forward.fluentd]
ca = "/home/ca.crt"
cert = "/home/client.crt"
key = "/home/client.key"
url = "https://localhost:8888/test.log"

[teleport]
addr = "example.teleport.com:443"
identity = "identity"
```

Update the configuration file as follows.

Change `forward.fluentd.url`  to the scheme, host and port you configured for
your Logstash `http` input earlier, `https://localhost:9601`. Change
`forward.fluentd.session-url` to the same value with the root URL path:
`https://localhost:9601/`.

Change `teleport.addr` to the host and port of your Teleport Proxy Service, or
the Auth Service if you have configured the Event Handler to connect to it
directly, e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/config-toml-teleport.mdx!)

### Start the Event Handler

Start the Teleport Teleport Event Handler as a daemon. To do so, create a
systemd service definition at the path
`/usr/lib/systemd/system/teleport-event-handler.service` with the following
content: 

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Teleport Event Handler
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/teleport-event-handler start --config=/etc/teleport-event-handler.toml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
PIDFile=/run/teleport-event-handler.pid

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the plugin:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport-event-handler
$ sudo systemctl start teleport-event-handler
```

<Details title="Choose when to start exporting events">

You can configure when you would like the Teleport Event Handler to begin
exporting events when you run the `start` command. This example will start
exporting from May 5th, 2021:

```code
$ teleport-event-handler start --config teleport-event-handler.toml --start-time "2021-05-05T00:00:00Z"
```

You can only determine the start time once, when first running the Teleport
Event Handler. If you want to change the time frame later, remove the plugin
state directory that you specified in the `storage` field of the handler's
configuration file.

</Details>

Once the Teleport Event Handler starts, you will see notifications about scanned
and forwarded events:

```code
$ sudo journalctl -u teleport-event-handler
DEBU   Event sent id:f19cf375-4da6-4338-bfdc-e38334c60fd1 index:0 ts:2022-09-21
18:51:04.849 +0000 UTC type:cert.create event-handler/app.go:140
...
```

## Step 4/4. Create a data view in Kibana

Make it possible to explore your Teleport audit events in Kibana by creating a
data view. In the Elastic Stack UI, find the hamburger menu on the upper
left of the screen, then click "Management" > "Data Views". Click "Create data
view".

For the "Name" field, use "Teleport Audit Events". In "Index pattern", use
`audit-events-*` to select all indices created by our Logstash pipeline. In
"Timestamp field", choose `time`, which Teleport adds to its audit events.

![Creating a data view](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/elasticsearch/data-view-create.png)

To use your data view, find the search box at the top of the Elastic Stack UI
and enter "Discover". On the upper left of the screen, click the dropdown menu
and select "Teleport Audit Events". You can now search and filter your Teleport
audit events in order to get a better understanding how users are interacting
with your Teleport cluster.

![Creating a data view](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/elasticsearch/data-view-explore.png)

For example, we can click the `event` field on the left sidebar and visualize
the event types for your Teleport audit events over time:

![Creating a visualization](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/elasticsearch/lens.png)

## Troubleshooting connection issues

If the Teleport Event Handler is displaying error logs while connecting to your
Teleport Cluster, ensure that:

- The certificate the Teleport Event Handler is using to connect to your
  Teleport cluster is not past its expiration date. This is the value of the
  `--ttl` flag in the `tctl auth sign` command, which is 12 hours by default.
- Ensure that in your Teleport Event Handler configuration file
  (`teleport-event-handler.toml`), you have provided the correct host *and* port
  for the Teleport Proxy Service or Auth Service.

## Next steps

Now that you are exporting your audit events to the Elastic Stack, consult our
[audit event reference](../../reference/audit.mdx#event-types) so you can plan
visualizations and alerts.

While this guide uses the `tctl auth sign` command to issue credentials for the
Teleport Event Handler, production clusters should use Machine ID for safer,
more reliable renewals. Read [our guide](../../machine-id/getting-started.mdx)
to getting started with Machine ID.
