title: Database Cert Authority Rotation
description: How to rotate Teleport database certificate authorities
---

Teleport connects to self-hosted databases using mutual TLS, or mTLS for short.
To enable mTLS connections to your self-hosted database via Teleport, you have
to configure your database and Teleport so that they can complete an mTLS
handshake: essentially, they need to trust each other.
To that end, your Teleport cluster manages its own internal database certificate
authorities.
This guide will explain how to rotate your Teleport cluster's database CAs.

## Prerequisites

## Database CA rotation

Teleport uses two certificate authorities for self-hosted database access:

- The `db` certificate authority is used to issue server certificates to
  self-hosted databases.
- The `db_client` certificate authority is used to issue an ephemeral
  client certificate to the Teleport Database Service when it connects to a
  self-hosted database.

Certificate authority rotation consists of several rotation phases.
The rotation phases have different effects depending on which CA is rotated.
This section will explain the differences and show you how to rotate your
database CAs.

### `db` CA Rotation phases

- `standby`: All operations have completed or haven't started yet.
- `init`: All Teleport cluster services are notified of the rotation.
  A new `db` certificate authority is created in your cluster.
  Remote trusted clusters must fetch the new CA.
  `tctl auth sign` will issue database server certs with the new CA.
- `update_clients`: Ephemeral client certificates issued to the Teleport Proxy
  Service will be issued by the new CA.
- `update_servers`: No effect during `db` CA rotation.
- `rollback`: The rotation was aborted and is rolling back to the old
  certificate authority.

### `db_client` CA Rotation phases

- `standby`: All operations have completed or haven't started yet.
- `init`: All Teleport cluster services are notified of the rotation.
  A new `db_client` certificate authority is created in your cluster.
  `tctl auth sign` will output both the old and new certificate authorities
  in its trusted CA output.
- `update_clients`: Ephemeral client certificates issued to the Teleport 
  Database Service will be issued by the new CA.
- `update_servers`: No effect during `db_client` CA rotation.
- `rollback`: The rotation was aborted and is rolling back to the old
  certificate authority.

### Rotation types

There are two types of certificate authority rotation processes:

- **Manual:** it is the cluster administrator's responsibility to transition
  between each phase of the rotation while monitoring database connectivity.
  Manual rotations are performed by providing the `--manual` flag and the
  desired phase using the `--phase` flag to the `tctl auth rotate` command.
- **Semi-automatic:** Teleport automatically transitions between phases of the
  rotation after some amount of time (known as a *grace period*) elapses.

For both types of rotation, the cluster goes through the phases in the
following order:

- `standby` -> `init` -> `update_clients` -> `update_servers` -> `standby`
  
It does not make sense to use semi-automatic rotation when rotating the `db`
or `db_client` CA, because self-hosted databases are not automatically
reconfigured by the semi-automatic process.
Therefore this guide will only explain manual rotation.

In manual mode we transition between phases while monitoring database
connectivity, and reconfigure databases with new CA certificates as needed.

You will need to reconfigure any given self-hosted database only once during the
rotation: it does not need to be done at each step.
You can reconfigure your databases during any phase, although it's best to do
so during the `init` phase to avoid losing database access later in the rotation.

If you lose connectivity to your databases during any phase prior to
`standby`, you can [roll back](#rollback) to the old certificate authority to
restore connectivity.

## Step 1/4. Start the rotation

Initiate manual rotation of the `db` or `db_client` certificate authority:
<Details title="Want to rotate both CAs?">
You should not rotate the `db` or `db_client` CA in parallel with other CA
rotations.
Rotating in parallel with other CA types, especially the `host` CA, is more
complicated, more likely to cause problems, and does not save you any effort.

However, if you want to rotate both the `db` and `db_client` CA, then you can
(and should) save yourself some effort by rotating both of them at the same
time.

You can rotate both `db` and `db_client` certificate authorities in parallel
by transitioning both CAs through each phase step.
Just use the `tctl auth rotate` command for each step with `--type=db` and
then `--type=db_client`.
</Details>

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=init 
Updated rotation phase to "init". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

Use `tctl` to confirm that there is an active rotation in progress:
```code
$ tctl status
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Avoid losing access to databases">
If you are rotating the `db_client` CA and you do not want to lose access to
your self-hosted databases in the next phase, you should reconfigure your 
databases now.
You do not need to reconfigure databases at this point if you are rotating only
the `db` CA, although there is no harm in doing so.

Consult the appropriate
[Teleport Database Access Guide](../../database-access/guides.mdx) for your
databases before proceeding to the `update_clients` rotation phase.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/4. Update clients

Execute the transition from `init` to `update_clients`:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=update_clients 
# Updated rotation phase to "update_clients". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

If you are rotating the `db_client` CA, this is the phase where the Teleport
Database Service will start using client certificates issued by the new CA to
connect to databases.
You should verify that you can still access your databases after transitioning
to this phase.

If you lose connectivity to your databases, you can reconfigure your
databases to restore access.
If that does not restore access or you are unable to reconfigure a database,
then [roll back](#rollback) to the old certificate authority.

## Step 3/4. Update servers

Execute the transition from `update_clients` to `update_servers`:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=update_servers 
# Updated rotation phase to "update_servers". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

This phase does not actually do anything for `db` or `db_client` CA rotation,
but it's required as part of the generalized Teleport CA rotation process before
we can finish the rotation.

## Step 4/4. Finish the rotation

If any of your self-hosted databases have not yet been reconfigured, you **will
lose access** to those databases after transitioning to the `standby` phase in
this final step.

To avoid down time, consult the appropriate
[Teleport Database Access Guide](../../database-access/guides.mdx) and reconfigure
your databases before proceeding.
Otherwise, access may still be restored by reconfiguring your self-hosted
databases after this step.

Execute the transition from `update_servers` to `standby`:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=standby
# Updated rotation phase to "standby". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

## Rollback

Rollback can only be performed before the rotation is completed, meaning before
the rotation transitions to `standby` from `update_servers`.

The most common reason you would want to rollback if is if you cannot
reconfigure your databases.
If you have connectivity issues after reconfiguring a database, it's likely that
you simply misconfigured the database.
If you roll back the rotation, then you will have to manually revert any
database reconfigurations and start from step 1 to reattempt rotating your
certificate authorities, so consider this a method of last resort.

First, enter the rollback phase with a manual phase transition:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=rollback
# Updated rotation phase to "rollback". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

If you reconfigured any of your databases during the rotation, you will need
to reconfigure them again before transitioning to `standby` from the `rollback`
phase.

Enter the standby phase manually:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=standby
# Updated rotation phase to "standby". To check status use 'tctl status'
```

It is very unlikely that you will lose database connectivity during a `db` CA
rotation and need to rollback.
However, when rotating your `db_client` CA you will definitely lose access to
any database that was not reconfigured during the `init` rotation phase.
If you are unable to reconfigure those databases, then rolling back should
restore access to them immediately.
