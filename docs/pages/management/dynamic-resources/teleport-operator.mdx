title: Teleport Kubernetes Operator
description: Easily manage Teleport resources from Kubernetes
---

The Teleport Kubernetes Operator provides a way for Kubernetes users to manage some Teleport resources through
Kubernetes, following [the Operator Pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

The Teleport Kubernetes Operator is deployed alongside its custom resource definitions. Once deployed, users
can use a Kubernetes client like `kubectl` or their existing CI/CD Kubernetes pipelines to create Teleport
custom resources. The Teleport Kubernetes Operator watches for those resources and does API calls to Teleport to
reach the desired state.  

The teleport-cluster Helm chart deploys the Teleport Kubernetes Operator as a sidecar in the auth pods.  
The Operator supports multiple auth pod replicas within a single cluster by electing a leader with a Kubernetes lease. 
If multiple `teleport-cluster` releases are using the same backend, only one should have the operator enabled.
Multiple operators from different leases will conflict and lock themselves.

Currently supported Teleport resources are:
- users
- roles
- OIDC connectors
- SAML connectors
- GitHub connectors
- Login Rules

This guide covers how to:
- Install Teleport Operator on Kubernetes.
- Manage Teleport users and roles using Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/self-hosted-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- Kubernetes cluster (with or without `teleport-cluster` Helm chart already deployed);
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

Validate Kubernetes connectivity by running the following command:

```code
$ kubectl cluster-info
# Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443
# CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
# Metrics-server is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:https/proxy
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  Users wanting to experiment locally with the operator can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
  to start a local Kubernetes cluster:
  ```code
  $ minikube start
  ```
</Admonition>

## Step 1/3. Install teleport-cluster Helm chart with the operator

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/helm/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

Install the Helm chart for the Teleport Cluster with `operator.enabled=true`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope="oss" label="Teleport Community Edition">

```code
$ helm install teleport-cluster teleport/teleport-cluster \
        --create-namespace --namespace teleport-cluster \
        --set clusterName=teleport-cluster.teleport-cluster.svc.cluster.local \
        --set operator.enabled=true \
        --version (=teleport.version=)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem scope="enterprise" label="Teleport Enterprise">

Create a namespace for your Teleport cluster resources:

```code
$ kubectl create namespace teleport-cluster
```

(!docs/pages/includes//enterprise/obtainlicense.mdx!)

Create a secret called "license" in the namespace you created:

```code
$ kubectl -n teleport-cluster create secret generic license --from-file=license.pem
```

Deploy your Teleport cluster and the Teleport Kubernetes Operator:

```code
$ helm install teleport-cluster teleport/teleport-cluster \
        --namespace teleport-cluster \
        --set enterprise=true \
        --set clusterName=teleport-cluster.teleport-cluster.svc.cluster.local \
        --set operator.enabled=true \
        --version (=teleport.version=)
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

This command installs the required Kubernetes CRDs and deploys the Teleport Kubernetes Operator next to the Teleport
cluster. All resources (except CRDs, which are cluster-scoped) are created in the `teleport-cluster` namespace.

All subsequent commands will take place in the `teleport-cluster` namespace, so let's use it by default:
```code
$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace teleport-cluster
```

## Step 2/3. Manage Teleport users and roles using `kubectl`

Create a manifest called `teleport-resources.yaml` that describes two custom resources: a `TeleportUser` and a `TeleportRole`:

```yaml
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v5
kind: TeleportRole
metadata:
  name: myrole
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['user', 'role']
        verbs: ['list','create','read','update','delete']
---
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v2
kind: TeleportUser
metadata:
  name: myuser
spec:
  roles: ['myrole']
```

Apply the manifests to the Kubernetes cluster:

```code
$ kubectl apply -f teleport-resources.yaml
```

List the created Kubernetes resources:

```code
$ kubectl get teleportroles
# NAME     AGE
# myrole   10m

$ kubectl get teleportusers
# NAME     AGE
# myuser   10m
```

Check the user `myuser` has been created in Teleport and has been granted the role `myrole`:
```code
$ AUTH_POD=$(kubectl get po -l app=teleport-cluster -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
$ kubectl exec -it "$AUTH_POD" -c teleport -- tctl users ls
# User                          Roles
# ----------------------------- -----------------------------
# bot-teleport-operator-sidecar bot-teleport-operator-sidecar
# myuser                        myrole
```

At this point the Teleport Kubernetes Operator is functional and Teleport users and roles can be managed from
Kubernetes.

## Step 3/3. Explore the Teleport CRDs

Available fields can be browsed with `kubectl explain` in a cluster with Teleport CRDs installed.
For example the command:
```code
$ kubectl explain teleportroles.spec
```
Returns the following fields:
```shell
KIND:     TeleportRole
VERSION:  resources.teleport.dev/v5

RESOURCE: spec <Object>

DESCRIPTION:
    Role resource definition v5 from Teleport

FIELDS:
   allow	<Object>
     Allow is the set of conditions evaluated to grant access.

   deny	<Object>
     Deny is the set of conditions evaluated to deny access. Deny takes priority
     over allow.

   options	<Object>
     Options is for OpenSSH options like agent forwarding.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Resource is not reconciled in Teleport

The Teleport Operator watches for new resources or changes in Kubernetes. When a change happens, it triggers the reconciliation
loop. This loop is in charge of validating the resource, checking if it already exists in Teleport and making calls to
the Teleport API to create/update/delete the resource. The reconciliation loop also adds a `status` field on the
Kubernetes resource.

If an error happens and the reconciliation loop is not successful, an item in `status.conditions` will describe what
went wrong. This allows users to diagnose errors by inspecting Kubernetes resources with `kubectl`:

```code
$ kubectl get teleportusers myuser -o yaml
```

For example, if a user has been granted a nonexistent role the status will look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v2
kind: TeleportUser
# [...]
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-25T16:15:52Z"
    message: Teleport resource has the Kubernetes origin label.
    reason: OriginLabelMatching
    status: "True"
    type: TeleportResourceOwned
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-07-25T17:08:58Z"
    message: 'Teleport returned the error: role my-non-existing-role is not found'
    reason: TeleportError
    status: "False"
    type: SuccessfullyReconciled
```

Here `SuccessfullyReconciled` is `False` and the error is `role my-non-existing-role is not found`.

If the status is not present or does not give sufficient information to solve the issue, check the operator logs:

```shell
$ kubectl logs "$AUTH_POD" -c operator
```

<Admonition type="note">
  In case of multi-replica deployments, only one operator instance is running the reconciliation loop. This operator
  is called the leader and is the only one producing reconciliation logs. The other operator instances are waiting with
  the following log:

  ```
  leaderelection.go:248] attempting to acquire leader lease teleport/431e83f4.teleport.dev...
  ```

  To diagnose reconciliation issues, you will have to inspect all pods to find the one reconciling the resources.
</Admonition>

### The operator does not see the resource

If you created a resource, and can get it with `kubectl get <resource-type>`, but
the resource status stays empty and the operator does not produce logs,
check if the resource lives in the `teleport-cluster` namespace.

The operator only watches for resources in its own namespace.

### Cluster instability after enabling the Operator

If enabling the Teleport Kubernetes Operator leads to cluster instability such as degraded proxy state, inability to log into the Teleport cluster,
or loss of access to the Teleport Web UI, check where your Auth Server pods are deployed.  All operator sidecars connecting to the same
shared backend must belong to the same `teleport-cluster` chart release to support the leader election process.
Failing to do so can lead to a degraded Teleport cluster and errors such as:

```text
[AUTH]      WARN lock targeting User:"bot-example" is in force: The bot user "bot-teleport-operator-sidecar" 
has been locked due to a certificate generation mismatch, possibly indicating a stolen certificate.
```
In order to resolve this issue, remove any Teleport Kubernetes Operator sidecars connecting to the shared backend that are not in the same
Kubernetes cluster or namespace.  Then redeploy the Auth Server pods.  When the operator starts, it deletes the cached information and recreates all required resources.

## Next steps

Helm Chart parameters are documented in the [`teleport-cluster` Helm chart reference](../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster.mdx).

See the [Helm Deployment guides](../../deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments.mdx) detailing specific setups like running Teleport on AWS or GCP.
