title: Registering Agentless OpenSSH Servers with IaC
description: Use infrastructure-as-code tooling to register Agentless OpenSSH servers in Teleport.
---

In this guide, you will see how to register in Teleport your OpenSSH nodes
through infrastructure as code (IaC). Teleport supports three ways to
dynamically create resources from code:
- The Teleport Kubernetes Operator, which allows you to manage Teleport resources
  from Kubernetes
- The Teleport Terraform Provider, which allows you to manage Teleport resources
  via Terraform
- The `tctl` CLI, which allows you to manage Teleport resources from your local
  computer or your CI environment

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you must have:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tctl">

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

A running operator by following either:
- [the guide to enable the operator in the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart](./teleport-operator-helm.mdx).
- [the guide to setup a standalone operator](./teleport-operator-standalone.mdx).

You must also set the namespace in which you deployed the operator as this is
the namespace where you will deploy the CustomResources:

```code
# for operators deployed with the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart
$ export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE="teleport-cluster"

# for standalone operators
$ export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE="teleport-iac"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

A functional Teleport Terraform provider by following [the Terraform provider guide](./terraform-provider.mdx).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
- a server running OpenSSH you will add to the Teleport cluster. This server
  must be reachable from the proxy (public IP address and firewall allowing
  traffic on port 22).

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you want to add a private SSH server (e.g. behind a NAT, in a private
  network, protected by a firewall blocking inbound traffic, ...) you can
  [install a Teleport agent](../../server-access/getting-started.mdx). The
  Teleport agent opens a tunnel to the Teleport Proxy Service, allowing any user
  to connect to it by going through the Proxy Service.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/4 - Gather the required information

To register an OpenSSH server in Teleport you will need the following information:

- The server hostname: <Var name="ssh-server-hostname" />
- The public server IP address with SSH port: <Var name="198.51.100.1:22" />

You must also choose a set of labels for the server. Those labels can be used to
describe the server and control which users can access the server. They can be
dynamically changed later, without having to reconfigure openSSH.

See the [Access Controls for Servers](../../server-access/rbac.mdx) page for
more details about labels and how to control access to your servers.

In the rest of this guide, the labels will be:
```yaml
env: test
team: engineering
```

## Step 2/4 - Write the server manifest

In this step, we'll write text files describing the OpenSSH server resource we
want to register in Teleport. Those files are called manifests and their syntax
will vary based on the IaC tooling you'll use.

Those manifests are typically versioned in a shared revision system like git.
This allows you to keep track of all changes, follow standard code review
procedures before changing resources in Teleport, and quickly redeploy your
Teleport instance if needed.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tctl">

You must pick a server ID, or Teleport will pick one for you. This ID is used
for two things:

- if you want to update the server information (e.g. change the labels) later,
  you will need to specify its ID in the manifest. Else Teleport will create a
  new server resource instead of editing the existing one.
- if you have multiple servers with identical hostnames, the unique ID allows
  you to pick a specific server.

(!docs/pages/includes/uuidgen.mdx!)

Create the following `openssh-node-resource.yaml` file:

```yaml
kind: node
version: v2
sub_kind: openssh
metadata:
  name: a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a  # this is the UUID previously generated
  labels:
    env: test
    team: engineering
spec:
  addr: <Var name="198.51.100.1:22" />
  hostname: <Var name="ssh-server-hostname" />
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

(!docs/pages/includes/uuidgen.mdx!)

Create the following `openssh-node-resource.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v1
kind: TeleportOpenSSHServerV2
metadata:
  name: a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a  # this is the UUID previously generated
  # kubernetes CR labels are propagated to the Teleport resource
  labels:
    env: test
    team: engineering
spec:
  addr: <Var name="198.51.100.1:22" />
  hostname: <Var name="ssh-server-hostname" />
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

Create the following `openssh-node-resource.tf` file:

```hcl
resource "teleport_server" "openssh_agentless" {
  version = "v2"
  sub_kind = "openssh"
  // Name is not required for servers, this is a special case.
  // When a name is not set, an UUID will be generated by Teleport and
  // imported back into Terraform.
  spec = {
    addr = "<Var name="198.51.100.1:22" />"
    hostname = "<Var name="ssh-server-hostname" />"
  }
}

output "openssh_node_id" {
  value = teleport_server.openssh_agentless.metadata.name
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/4. Apply all manifests

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tctl">

Declare the server with the following command:

```code
$ tctl create -f openssh-node-resource.yaml
node "a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a" has been created
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

Apply the Kubernetes manifest with the following command:

```code
$ kubectl apply -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" -f openssh-node-resource.yaml
teleportopensshserverv2.resources.teleport.dev/a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a created
```

Then list the `TeleportOpenSSHServerV2` Kubernetes custom resources:

```code
$ kubectl get teleportopensshserverv2 -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE"
# NAME                                   AGE
# a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a   10m
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

Test the Terraform connectivity and review the changes:

```code
$ terraform plan
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # teleport_server.openssh_agentless will be created
  + resource "teleport_server" "openssh_agentless" {
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + kind     = (known after apply)
      + metadata = (known after apply)
      + spec     = {
          + addr     = "<Var name="198.51.100.1:22" />"
          + hostname = "<Var name="ssh-server-hostname" />"
        }
      + sub_kind = "openssh"
      + version  = "v2"
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + openssh_node_id = (known after apply)
```

Apply the plan and recover the node UUID:

```code
$ terraform apply
# [...]
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

teleport_server.openssh_agentless: Creating...
teleport_server.openssh_agentless: Creation complete after 3s [id=a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

openssh_node_id = "a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/4. Validate the server created in Teleport

Now that the IaC tooling has run, we'll validate that Teleport is now aware of
the OpenSSH server:

```code
# List nodes with a given hostname or IP address
$ tsh ls --search="<Var name="ssh-server-hostname" />"
Node Name                                           Address        Labels
--------------------- ------------ --------------- --------------------------
<Var name="ssh-server-hostname" /> <Var name="198.51.100.1:22" /> env=test,team=engineering

# Get the node details by hostname
$ tctl get "node/<Var name="ssh-server-hostname" />"

# Get the node details by ID
$ tctl get node/a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a
```

## Step 4/4. Trust the Teleport CA and issue host certificates

At this point, Teleport is aware that there's an OpenSSH server and knows how to
contact it and which user should have access. However, neither Teleport nor the
server trust each other.

You need to configure the server to trust connections coming from Teleport (trust
the Teleport SSH Certificate Authority), and you need to give the server an SSH
Host certificate issued by Teleport.

Those steps can be automated, but the automation will depend on your custom
infrastructure and tooling (you can configure the SSH CA in the VM image, use
custom startup scripts, provision servers with Ansible, ...).

A step-by-step manual setup is described
in [the OpenSSH manual installation guide](../../server-access/openssh/openssh-manual-install.mdx)
starting with the Step 2.

## Next steps

- [Setup RBAC](../../server-access/rbac.mdx) to control which user can SSH on which server.
