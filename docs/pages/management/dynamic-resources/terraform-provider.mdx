This guide demonstrates how to: Set up the Terraform provider for Teleport on
Linux and macOS.

Terraform is intended to be used with Machine ID, Teleport's feature for providing identities to
machines and services, rather than users. This tutorial will show you how to use
a local Machine ID bot to try it out.

For instructions on managing users and roles via Terraform, read
the ["Managing users and roles with IaC" guide](./user-and-role.mdx).

For instructions on managing the Teleport dynamic resources as code using
GitOps, read the guide to using the Teleport Terraform provider with [Spacelift
and Machine ID](../../machine-id/deployment/spacelift.mdx).

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Create Teleport credentials for Terraform

Terraform needs a signed identity file from the Teleport cluster certificate
authority to manage resources in the cluster. To prepare credentials using a local Teleport bot:

1. Create a folder called `teleport-terraform` to hold temporary files:

   ```code
   $ mkdir -p teleport-terraform
   $ cd teleport-terraform
   ```

1. Create a new file called `terraform.yaml` and open it in an editor.

1. Terraform needs a role giving it permission to manage our Cluster's resources. The bot will
   create identity certificates that have this role. Configure the necessary role by pasting
   the following content into a `terraform_role.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   metadata:
     name: terraform
   spec:
     allow:
       db_labels:
         '*': '*'
       app_labels:
         '*': '*'
       node_labels:
         '*': '*'
       rules:
         - resources:
           - app
           - cluster_auth_preference
           - cluster_networking_config
           - db
           - device
           - github
           - login_rule
           - oidc
           - okta_import_rule
           - role
           - saml
           - session_recording_config
           - token
           - trusted_cluster
           - user
           - access_list
           - node
           verbs: ['list','create','read','update','delete']
   version: v7
   ```

   These settings configure a role named `terraform` with the permissions
   required to manage resources in your Teleport cluster.

1. Create the `terraform` role by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f terraform_role.yaml
   role 'terraform' has been created
   ```

1. We're going to create two scripts that will let us quickly and repeatably create and destroy
   our local Terraform bot. First, create a new file called `create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh`,
   open it in an editor, and paste in the following content:

   ```shell
   #! /usr/bin/env bash

   TOKEN=$(tctl bots add terraform-test --roles=terraform --format=json | jq -r '.token_id')
   tbot start \
     --destination-dir=./terraform-identity \
     --token="$TOKEN" \
     --data-dir=./tbot-data \
     --join-method=token \
     --auth-server=tele.example.com:443
     # Replace with the host and port of your Teleport Auth Service
     # or Teleport Proxy Service
   ```

   When run, this creates a new bot with the token retrieved from the JSON output. That token
   is piped into the start command. For security reasons, we don't allow bot join tokens to be
   created in any way other than adding a bot, so for local development work, you must manually
   manage the bot and its token.

1. Create another file called `remove_terraform_bot.sh`, open it in an editor, and
paste in the following content:

   ```shell
   #! /usr/bin/env bash

   tctl bots rm terraform-test
   rm -rf ./terraform-identity
   ```

   This script will be used later to clean up our bot in between runs and when we're done.

1. In a new terminal window, run the `create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh` script to create the new bot
   and start it:

   ```code
   $ chmod +x create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh
   $ ./create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh
   ```

## Step 2/3. Prepare a Terraform configuration file

To prepare a Terraform configuration file:

1. Create a new file called `provider.tf` and open it in an editor.

1. Use the Teleport Terraform provider and connect it to your Teleport cluster 
   by pasting the following content into the `provider.tf` file:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem scope={["cloud","team"]} label="Cloud-Hosted">
   ```hcl
   (!examples/resources/terraform/provider-cloud.tf!)
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">
   ```hcl
   (!examples/resources/terraform/provider-self-hosted.tf!)
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Validate the configuration

To apply the configuration:

1. Check the contents of the `teleport-terraform` folder:

   ```code
   $ ls
   # provider.tf  terraform-identity/  create_and_run_terraform_bot.sh remove_terraform_bot.sh  terraform_role.yaml
   ```

1. Initialize the working directory that contains Terraform configuration files
   by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ terraform init
   ```

1. Execute the Terraform plan defined in the configuration file by running the
   following command:

   ```code
   $ terraform apply
   ```

1. When you're done, use Ctrl-C to stop the Terraform bot. Then run the `remove_terraform_bot.sh` script to remove the bot and clean up the `terraform-identity` folder:

   ```code
   $ chmod +x remove_terraform_bot.sh
   $ ./remove_terraform_bot.sh
   ```

   If you need to start the bot back up, you can run the two bot scripts as many times as necessary.
