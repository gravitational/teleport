This guide demonstrates how to:

- Set up the Terraform provider for Teelport on Linux and macOS.
- Configure Teleport users and roles using the Terraform provider.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Create Teleport credentials for Terraform

Terraform needs a signed identity file from the Teleport cluster certificate
authority to manage resources in the cluster.
You can create a local Teleport user for this purpose or you can use a 
[Machine ID](../../machine-id/introduction.mdx) to generate credentials.

If you intend to run Terraform from a CI/CD platform, a Machine ID is often a better 
option for generating credentials. A Machine ID can provision ephemeral short-lived 
certificates that are appopriate for CI/CD workflows instead of using manually-generated 
credentials that have a longer time-to-live (TTL) period. For more information about
using a Machine ID, see the [Machine ID Getting Started Guide](../../machine-id/getting-started.mdx).

To prepare credentials for a local Teleport user:

1. Create a folder called `teleport-terraform` to hold temporary files:

   ```code
   $ mkdir -p teleport-terraform
   $ cd teleport-terraform
   ```

1. Create a new file called `terraform.yaml` and open it in an editor.

1. Configure settings for a local Teleport user and role by pasting the following content into the `terraform.yaml` file:
   
   ```yaml
   kind: role
   metadata:
     name: terraform
   spec:
     allow:
       db_labels:
         '*': '*'
       app_labels:
         '*': '*'
       rules:
         - resources:
           - app
           - cluster_auth_preference
           - cluster_networking_config
           - db
           - device
           - github
           - login_rule
           - oidc
           - okta_import_rule
           - role
           - saml
           - session_recording_config
           - token
           - trusted_cluster
           - user
           verbs: ['list','create','read','update','delete']
   version: v6
   ---
   kind: user
   metadata:
     name: terraform
   spec:
     roles: ['terraform']
   version: v2
   ```
   
   These settings configure a user and role named `terraform` with the permissions 
   required to manage resources in your Teleport cluster.

1. Create the `terraform` user and role by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl create terraform.yaml
   ```
   
   The `terraform` user can't sign in to get credentials, so you must have another user
   **impersonate** the `terraform` account to request a certificate.

1. Create a new file called `terraform-impersonator.yaml` and open it in an editor.

1. Configure a role that enables your user to impersonate the Terraform user by pasting 
the following content into the `terraform-impersonator.yaml` file:
   
   ```yaml
   kind: role
   version: v6
   metadata:
     name: terraform-impersonator
   spec:
     allow:
       # This impersonate rule will allow any user with this role to impersonate
       # and generate certificates for the user named "terraform" with a role also
       # named "terraform".
       impersonate:
         users: ['terraform']
         roles: ['terraform']
   ```

1. Create the terraform-impersonator role by running the following command:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl create terraform-impersonator.yaml
   ```

1. (!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="terraform-impersonator"!)

1. Request a signed identity file for the Terraform user by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth sign --user=terraform --out=terraform-identity
   ```
   
   After running this command, you have a `terraform-identity` file with credentials for the Terraform user.

## Step 2/3. Prepare a Terraform configuration file

To prepare a Terraform configuration file:

1. Create a new file called `main.tf` and open it in an editor.

1. Define an example user and role using Terraform by pasting the following content into the `main.tf` file:
   
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem scope={["cloud","team"]} label="Cloud-Hosted">
   ```
   (!examples/resources/terraform/terraform-user-role-cloud.tf!)
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">
   ```
   (!examples/resources/terraform/terraform-user-role-self-hosted.tf!)
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Apply the configuration

To apply the configuration:

1. Check the contents of the `teleport-terraform` folder:

   ```code
   $ ls
   # main.tf  terraform-identity  terraform-impersonator.yaml  terraform.yaml
   ```

1. Initialize the working directory that containsTerraform configuration files by running the 
following command:
   
   ```code
   $ terraform init
   ```

1. Executes the Terraform plan defined int he configuration file by running the 
following command:
   
   ```code
   $ terraform apply
   ```
