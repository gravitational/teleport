The Teleport team delivers a new major release roughly every 3 months.

## Teleport

### 11.2

#### Script-based upgrades

Teleport will add the ability to upload installation scripts which can then be
remotely pushed to upgrade hosts.

#### Add support for X.509 integration for self-hosted Microsoft SQL Server

Teleport Database Access will add the ability to configure Microsoft SQL Server
access to accept X.509 authentication instead of keytab credentials.

#### ARM64 support for CentOS 7

ARM64 (AWS Graviton) binaries have been updated to support CentOS 7.

#### Signed macOS tarball archives

Teleport macOS binaries will be signed and notarized and no longer prompt the
user to accept unsigned binaries.

#### Graceful handling expired database certificates in Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect will detect when database certificates expire and prompt the
user to log in again to refresh their credentials.

#### Fixed per-session MFA when used with `disconnect_expired_cert`

Teleport can automatically disconnect user sessions when their certificates
expire, but this functionality previously conflicted with per-session MFA and
required per-session MFA to be disabled. With Teleport 11.2 you’ll be able to
run with both of these settings enabled for increased security.

#### Improved database joining flow in the Web UI

Teleport Access Manager in the Web UI will support adding self-hosted
PostgreSQL and RDS databases.

### 11.3

#### Dropping support for SHA-1

Newer OpenSSH clients won't need the workaround with accepting SHA-1 signed certificates
to connect to Teleport Proxy anymore.

#### Adding support for claim rewriting with Login Rules

Cluster administrators will be able to modify SSO claims without making changes to the
identity provider.

Device Trust, improved resource onboarding, and non-AD support for Desktop Access.

## Semantic Versioning

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for pre-releases
and releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases have suffixes `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc`. They are not ready for
production:

- You can use alpha releases such as `5.0.1-alpha.1` for trying new features.
  Things can break and new changes may not be backwards-compatible.
- Teleport `beta` releases, such as `5.0.1-beta.2` are suitable for staging
  environments.  We are unlikely to change the APIs while we are ironing out
  bugs and UX glitches.
- We mark release candidates as `5.0.1-rc.1` coding and bug fixes are finished.
  The team is going through the manual test plan to find any regressions.

### Releases

Releases are ready for production use.

- Releases `5.0.0` and `6.0.0` are major releases. We publish 4 major releases each year.
  Read more about upgrades and compatibility [here](../management/operations/upgrading.mdx).
- Releases `5.1.0` are minor releases. They contain minor backwards-compatible improvements and backports.
- Versions like `5.0.1` are quick patches. They contain backwards-compatible fixes.
