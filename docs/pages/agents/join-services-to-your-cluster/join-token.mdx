title: Join Services with a Secure Token
description:  This guide shows you how to join a Teleport instance to your cluster using a join token in order to proxy access to resources in your infrastructure.
---

In this guide, we will show you how to register a Teleport process running one
or more services to your cluster by presenting a **join token**. 

In this approach, you declare your intention to register a new Teleport process,
and Teleport generates a secure token that the process uses to establish a trust
relationship with the Teleport cluster.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux server that you will use to host your Teleport process, e.g., a
  virtual machine or Docker container with an image based on a Linux
  distribution.

  In this guide, we will show you how to register a Teleport SSH Service
  instance. This approach also applies to other Teleport services, like the
  Proxy Service, Kubernetes Service, Database Service, and other services for
  accessing resources in your infrastructure.

  <Details type="tip" title="Running multiple Proxy Service instances behind a
  load balancer" >

  The join token method works if a cluster includes a single Proxy Service
  instance as well as multiple Proxy Service instances behind a load balancer
  (LB) or a DNS entry with multiple values. If there are multiple Proxy Service
  instances, a Teleport process joining the cluster establishes a tunnel to
  every Proxy Service instance.
  
  If you are using a load balancer, it must use a round-robin or a similar
  balancing algorithm. Do not use sticky load balancing algorithms (i.e.,
  "session affinity") with Teleport Proxy Service instances.  

  </Details>

  <Notice type="tip" >

  If you are are using a Docker container, note that this guide assumes that
  your Linux host has `curl` and `sudo` installed. 

  </Notice>

## Step 1/3. Install Teleport

Install Teleport on your Linux host.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/3. Join your Teleport process to the cluster

In this section, we will join your Teleport process to your cluster by:

- Obtaining a join token
- Running your Teleport process with the join token

### Generate a token

Teleport only allows access to resources in your infrastructure via Teleport
processes that that have joined the cluster.

On your local machine, use the `tctl` tool to generate a new token. In the
following example, a new token is created with a TTL of five minutes:

```code
# Generate a short-lived invite token for a new Teleport SSH Service instance:
$ tctl tokens add --ttl=5m --type=node 
The invite token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
This token will expire in 5 minutes.

Run this on the new node to join the cluster:

> teleport start \
   --roles=node \
   --token=(=presets.tokens.first=) \
   --ca-pin=(=presets.ca_pin=) \
   --auth-server=192.0.2.0:3025

Please note:

  - This invitation token will expire in 5 minutes
  - 192.0.2.0:3025 must be reachable from the new node
```

In this command, we assigned the token the `node` type, indicating that it will
belong to an SSH Service instance. 

Copy the token so you can use it later in this guide. You can ignore the rest of
the `tctl tokens add` output.

<Details title="Supported token types">

Here are all the values we support for `--type` flag when creating a join token:

|Role|Teleport Service|
|---|---|
|`app`|Application Service|
|`auth`|Auth Service|
|`bot`|Machine ID|
|`db`|Database Service|
|`discovery`|Discovery Service|
|`kube`|Kubernetes Service|
|`node`|SSH Service|
|`proxy`|Proxy Service|
|`windowsdesktop`|Windows Desktop Service|

</Details>

Administrators can generate tokens as they are needed. A Teleport process can
use a token multiple times until its time to live (TTL) expires, with the
exception of tokens with the `bot` type, which are used by Machine ID.

To list all of the tokens you have generated, run the following command:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token                            Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
-------------------------------- ---- ------ --------------------------
(=presets.tokens.first=) Node        30 Mar 23 18:15 UTC (2m8s)
```

<Details scope={["oss","enterprise"]} title="An insecure alternative: static tokens" scopeOnly={false} >

<Notice type="Danger">
Use short-lived tokens instead of long-lived static tokens.
Static tokens are easier to steal, guess, and leak.
</Notice>

Static tokens are defined ahead of time by an administrator and stored in the
Auth Service's config file:

```yaml
# Config section in `/etc/teleport.yaml` file for the Auth Service
auth_service:
    enabled: true
    tokens:
    # This static token allows new hosts to join the cluster as "proxy" or "node"
    - "proxy,node:secret-token-value"
    # A token can also be stored in a file. In this example the token for adding
    # new Auth Service instances are stored in /path/to/tokenfile
    - "auth:/path/to/tokenfile"
```
</Details>

### Start your Teleport process with the invite token

Execute the following command on the host running your new Teleport process to
add it to a cluster. Assign <Var name="join-token" /> to the token you generated
earlier and <Var name="proxy-address" /> to the host and web port of your
Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant (e.g.,
`teleport.example.com:443`):

```code
$ sudo teleport configure \
   --roles=node \
   --token=<Var name="join-token" /> \
   --proxy=<Var name="proxy-address" /> \
   -o file
```

<Notice type="tip">

For SSH Service instances, you can also run `teleport node configure` instead of
`teleport configure`. This way, you can exclude the `--roles=node` flag from the
command.

</Notice>

<Details title="Connecting directly to the Auth Service">

So far, this guide has assumed that you are joining your new Teleport process to
your cluster by connecting it to the Proxy Service. (This is the only
possibility in Teleport Enterprise Cloud.) Depending on the design of your
infrastructure, you may need to connect your new Teleport process directly to
the Auth Service.

<Notice type="warning">

Only connect Teleport processes directly to the Auth Service if no other join
methods are suitable, as we recommend exposing the Auth Service to as few
sources of ingress traffic as possible.

</Notice>

The Teleport process joining the cluster must also establish trust with the Auth
Service in order to prevent an attacker from hijacking the address of your Auth
Service host. 

To do this, you supply your new Teleport process with a secure hash value
generated by the Auth Service's certificate authority, called a **CA pin**. This
way, an attacker cannot easily forge a private key to trick your Teleport
process into communicating with a malicious service.

### Obtain a CA pin

On you local machine, retrieve the CA pin of the Auth Service: 

```code
$ tctl status
Cluster      teleport.example.com
Version      12.1.1
host CA      never updated
user CA      never updated
db CA        never updated
openssh CA   never updated
jwt CA       never updated
saml_idp CA  never updated
CA pin       (=presets.ca_pin=)
```

Copy the CA pin and assign it to the value of <Var name="ca-pin" />.

<Notice type="warning">

The CA pin becomes invalid if a Teleport administrator performs the CA rotation
by executing [`tctl auth rotate`](../../reference/cli/tctl.mdx#tctl-auth-rotate).
    
</Notice>

### Configure your Teleport process with the join token and CA pin

Run the following command to configure your Teleport process instead of the
`teleport configure` command we showed you earlier. Assign <Var
name="auth-service" /> to the host and gRPC port of your Auth Service host, e.g.,
`teleport.example.com:3025`.

```code
$ sudo teleport configure \
   --roles=node \
   --token=<Var name="join-token" /> \
   --auth-server=<Var name="auth-service" /> \
   -o file
```

Next, edit the Teleport configuration file, `/etc/teleport.yaml`, assigning the
CA pin (the `teleport.ca_pin` field) to the one you copied earlier:

```code
$ sudo sed -i 's|  ca_pin: ""|  ca_pin: "<Var name="ca-pin"> />"|' /etc/teleport.yaml
```

</Details>

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

<Details title="Using a local Docker container?">

If you followed this guide with a local Docker container, execute the following
command within your container to run your new Teleport process in the foreground:

```code
$ teleport start
```

</Details>

As new services come online, they start sending heartbeat requests every few
seconds to the Auth Service. This allows users to explore cluster membership and
size.

Run the following command on your local machine to see all of the Teleport SSH
Service instances in your cluster:

```code
$ tctl nodes ls
Host          UUID                  Public Address Labels                 Version
------------- --------------------- -------------- ---------------------- -------
1f58429134c4  6805dda3-779e-493b...                hostname=1f58429134c4  (=teleport.version=)
```


## Step 3/3. Revoke an invitation

You can revoke a join token to prevent a Teleport process from using it.

Run the following command on your local machine to create a token for a new
Proxy Service:

```code
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=proxy 
# The invite token: (=presets.tokens.first=).
# This token will expire in 5 minutes.
# 
# Run this on the new node to join the cluster:
# 
# > teleport start \
#    --roles=proxy \
#    --token=(=presets.tokens.first=) \
#    --ca-pin=(=presets.ca_pin=) \
#    --auth-server=123.123.123.123:443
# 
# Please note:
# 
#   - This invitation token will expire in 5 minutes
#   - 123.123.123.123 must be reachable from the new node
```

Next, run the following command to see a list of outstanding tokens:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token                            Type  Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
-------------------------------- ----- ------ ---------------------------
(=presets.tokens.first=) Node         30 Mar 23 18:20 UTC (36s)
(=presets.tokens.second=) Proxy        30 Mar 23 18:24 UTC (4m39s)
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Signup tokens">

The output of `tctl tokens ls` includes tokens used for adding users alongside
tokens used for adding Teleport processes to your cluster.

</Admonition>

You generated the token with the `Node` role earlier in this guide to invite a
new Teleport process to this cluster. The second token is the one you generated
for a Proxy Service instance.

Tokens created via `tctl` can be deleted (revoked) via the `tctl tokens rm`
command. Copy the second token from the output above and run the following
command to delete it, assigning the token to <Var name="token-to-delete" />.

```code
$ tctl tokens rm <Var name="token-to-delete"/>
# Token (=presets.tokens.first=) has been deleted
```

## Next steps

- If you have workloads split across different networks or clouds, we recommend
  setting up trusted clusters. Read how to get started in [Configure Trusted Clusters](../../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx).
