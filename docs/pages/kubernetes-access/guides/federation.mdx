## Federated Kubernetes access with Trusted Clusters

There are cases when you have Kubernetes clusters that have to operate independently,
for example, they are part of a different organization or have intermittent connectivity.

You can take advantage of [Trusted Clusters](../../trustedclusters.mdx)
to federate trust across Kubernetes clusters.

When multiple trusted clusters are present behind a Teleport proxy, the
`kubeconfig` generated by [tsh login](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#tsh-login) will contain the
Kubernetes API endpoint determined by the `<cluster>` argument to [tsh
login](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#tsh-login).

For example, consider the following setup:

- There are three Teleport/Kubernetes clusters: `main`, `east`, and `west`. These are the names set in `cluster_name` setting in their configuration files.
- The clusters `east` and `west` are trusted clusters for `main`.
- Users always authenticate against `main` but use their certificates to access
  SSH nodes and Kubernetes API in all three clusters.
- The DNS name of the main proxy server is `main.example.com`

In this scenario, users usually log in using this command:

```code
# Using login without arguments
$ tsh --proxy=main.example.com login

# User's `kubeconfig` now contains one entry for the main Kubernetes
# endpoint, i.e. `main.example.com`.

# Receive a certificate for "east":
$ tsh --proxy=main.example.com login east

# User's `kubeconfig` now contains the entry for the "east" Kubernetes
# endpoint, i.e. `east.main.example.com`.
```
