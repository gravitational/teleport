description: Teleport Kubernetes Access introduction, demo and resources
---

Teleport provides a unified access for Kubernetes clusters.

- Users can receive short-lived certificates using Single Sign-On (SSO) and switch between clusters without relogins.
- Admins can use *roles* to implement policies like the best practice that *developers must not access production* and enforce
  dual authorization using [access requests](../enterprise/workflow/index.mdx) for privileged operations.
- Organizations can achieve compliance by capturing `kubectl` events and session recordings for `kubectl`.

## SSO and Audit for Kubernetes Clusters

Set up SSO, capture audit events and sessions with Teleport running in a Kubernetes cluster.
