title: Managing Access to Kubernetes Clusters
description: Use Teleport's sophisticated RBAC and Trusted Clusters to ensure that your teams have the correct access to your Kubernetes clusters.

Once you register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport, you can apply
sophisticated policies to manage the way users access your cluster.

Read our [Kubernetes RBAC guide](./guides/rbac.mdx) for step-by-step
instructions to giving your users the correct access to Kubernetes clusters,
groups, users, and resources.

See how to federate your Kubernetes access controls using [Teleport Trusted
Clusters](./guides/federation.mdx).

For a comprehensive reference to configuring access controls in your
Teleport-registered Kubernetes clusters, see our [Access Controls
Reference](./access-controls.mdx).
