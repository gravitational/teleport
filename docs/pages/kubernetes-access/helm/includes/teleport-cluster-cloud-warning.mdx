<Details scopeOnly={true} scope={["cloud"]} title="Teleport Cloud warning">
This guide shows you how to install the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart, which is intended to help you get started with Teleport by deploying the Auth Service and 
Proxy Service in a Kubernetes cluster so you can access that cluster via the Kubernetes Service.

Since the Auth and Proxy Services are fully managed in Teleport Cloud, you should install our `teleport-kube-agent` chart, which is intended for deployments where the Auth Service and Proxy Service run outside your Kubernetes cluster.

You can use the `teleport-kube-agent` chart to enable the Application Service and Database Service in addition to the Kubernetes Service.

For more information, see our [Helm chart reference](../reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx).
