title: Database Access High Availability (HA)
description: How to configure Teleport database access in a Highly Available (HA) configuration.
---

You can deploy the Teleport Database Service in a Highly Available (HA)
configuration using two methods, both of which involve pointing multiple
Database Service instances to the same database instance:

- Deploying multiple Database Service instances with the same dynamic resource
  watchers.
- Deploying multiple Database Service instances configured to proxy the same
  database instances.

## Dynamic resource watchers

You can configure multiple Database Service replicas to watch for the same
dynamic `db` resources.

To configure the Database Service to watch for dynamic resources, add a `labels`
field to its `resources` configuration: 

```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "region": "us-east-1"
```

When you create a dynamic `db` resource, all Database Service replicas
configured to watch that `db` resource's labels will proxy the corresponding
database instance. For example, the `db_service` configuration above instructs
the Database Service to proxy any `db` resource with the `region:us-east-1`
label.

When connecting, Teleport will randomly pick the Database Service instance to
connect through to provide some load balancing. If the selected instance is down
(e.g. in case of a data center outage), Teleport will try to connect via other
instances.

For information on setting up dynamic database resources, see [Dynamic Database
Registration](./dynamic-registration.mdx).

## Static Database Service configuration

You can explicitly configure Database Service replicas to connect to the same
database instances using the Database Service's static configuration. This
approach is useful if you expect the databases you will proxy via Teleport to
remain stable over time.

There are two approaches to deploying the Database Service in high availability
using static configuration, which we will describe below:

- **Combined replicas**: Teleport load balances database traffic across Database
  Service replicas
- **Separate replicas**: Clients choose which agent to use to connect to a
  database

### Combined replicas

If you have two Database Services proxying the same database, configuration for
both agents would be identical:

```yaml
# Same config for both agents.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  - name: "postgres"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

With this configuration, you will see only a single entry for the database in
`tsh db ls`:

```code
$ tsh db ls
# Name
# --------
# postgres

$ tsh db connect postgres
```

As with dynamic resources, Teleport will randomly pick a Database Service
instance to connect through to when connecting to a database. 

### Separate replicas

With separate replicas, each Database Service instance proxying the database
assigns it a different name. This allows you to explicitly pick the agent
you want to connect to the database over:

```yaml
# Database service instance #1.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  # Note the name is different than instance #2 but the URI is the same.
  - name: "postgres-us-east-1a"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

```yaml
# Database service instance #2.
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  # Note the name is different than instance #1 but the URI is the same.
  - name: "postgres-us-east-1b"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "postgres.example.com:5432"
```

With this configuration, both services will appear as two separate entries in
`tsh db ls` output and you will have to pick one explicitly when connecting:

```code
$ tsh db ls
# Name
# -------------------
# postgres-us-east-1a
# postgres-us-east-1b

$ tsh db connect postgres-us-east-1a
```

This approach is useful when you want to have control over which replica
you're using to connect.
