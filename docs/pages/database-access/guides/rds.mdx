<Admonition type="note" title="Supported versions">

The following products are not compatible with Teleport as they don't support
IAM authentication:

    - Aurora Serverless v1.
    - RDS MariaDB versions lower than 10.6.

We recommend upgrading Aurora Serverless v1 to [Aurora Serverless
v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html),
which supports IAM authentication.

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- AWS account with RDS and Aurora databases and permissions to create and attach
  IAM policies.

- A Linux host or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service cluster where you will run
  the Teleport Database Service, which proxies connections to your RDS
  databases. 

  If you are running the Teleport Database Service on Kubernetes, you will need
  to install the `teleport` binary on your local workstation. Visit the
  [Installation](../../installation.mdx) page for environment-specific
  instructions.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/6. Create a Teleport user

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/create-user.mdx!)

## Step 2/6. Create a Database Service configuration

In this section, you will configure the Teleport Database Service. To do so, you
will:

- Create a join token for the service to demonstrate trust with your Teleport
  cluster
- Set up your package manager so you can install and run the Database Service
- Generate a configuration for the Database Service

### Create a join token

Establish trust between the Teleport Database Service and your Teleport cluster
by creating a join token:

Generate a join token by running the following command on your workstation and
save it in `/tmp/token` on the host that will run the Database Service:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=db
```

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/alternative-methods-join.mdx!)

### Prepare your environment

Next, get your environment ready to run the Teleport Database Service:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux Host">

Install Teleport on the host where you will run the Teleport Database Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Cluster">

(!docs/pages/kubernetes-access/helm/includes/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create a configuration file

Generate a configuration for the Teleport Database Service:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux Host">

Run the command below on your Linux host.

Assign <Var name="teleport.example.com:443" /> to the host and port of your
Teleport Proxy Service or Enterprise Cloud/Team tenant. Assign <Var
name="us-west-1" /> to the region associated with the RDS databases you would
like Teleport to discover.

```code
$ teleport db configure create \
   -o file \
   --proxy=<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />  \
   --token=/tmp/token \
   --rds-discovery=<Var name="us-west-1" />
```

The command will generate a Database Service configuration with RDS/Aurora
database auto-discovery enabled on the configured region and place it at the
`/etc/teleport.yaml` location.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Cluster">

Follow the instructions below on your local workstation.

Create a file called `kube-agent-config.yaml` in your current working directory
with the following content:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: teleport-rds
  data_dir: "/var/lib/teleport"
  proxy_server: ""
  join_params:
    method: token
    token_name: /etc/teleport-secrets/auth-token
db_service:
  enabled: true
  aws:
  - types: ["rds"]
    regions:
    - ""
    tags:
      "*": "*"
auth_service:
  enabled: "no"
ssh_service:
  enabled: "no"
proxy_service:
  enabled: "no"
```

Assign `teleport.proxy_server` to the host and port of your Teleport Proxy
Service or Enterprise Cloud/Team tenant (e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`).
Assign `db_service.aws[0].regions` to a list of AWS region strings (e.g.,
`"us-west-1"`) in which you would like the Teleport Database Service to discover
databases.

Later in this guide, you will install a Helm chart to launch the Teleport
Database Service. The chart creates a secret containing the join token you
generated earlier in this guide and mounts it at the path
`/etc/teleport-secrets/auth-token` on the Database Service pod. The
configuration above instructs the Database Service to search for its token
there.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/6. Create IAM policies for Teleport

The Teleport Database Service needs AWS IAM permissions to be able to:

- Discover and register RDS instances and Aurora clusters.
- Configure IAM authentication for them.

In this step, we will show you how to provide the Teleport Database Service
access to AWS credentials by using the Teleport configuration file we created
earlier to automatically create and attach IAM policies:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux Host">

Follow these instructions on your Linux host.

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx service="the Database Service"!)

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/aws-bootstrap.mdx!)

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Cluster">

Follow these instructions on your local workstation, where you will generate IAM
policies for the Teleport Database Service using the `teleport` binary.

### Obtain AWS credentials

You will need to authenticate the `teleport` binary to your AWS account by
providing credentials to its AWS client.

Obtain values for the following environment variables from your organization and
export these variables within your shell:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

<Details title="Have multiple sources of AWS credentials?">

Teleport's AWS client loads credentials from different sources in the following
order:

- Environment Variables
- Shared credentials file
- Shared configuration file (Teleport always enables shared configuration)
- EC2 Instance Metadata (credentials only)

While you can provide AWS credentials via a shared credentials file or shared
configuration file, you will need to run the `teleport` binary with the
`AWS_PROFILE` environment variable assigned to the name of your profile of
choice. 

If you have a specific use case that the instructions above do not account for,
consult the documentation for the [AWS SDK for
Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/) for a detailed
description of credential loading behavior.

</Details>

### Generate and attach IAM policies

Create IAM policies for the Teleport Database Service so you can attach them to
its IAM identity. 

For the purpose of this guide, retrieve the IAM role associated with your EKS
node group, which we will attach our newly generated policies to.

<Admonition title="Do not do this in production" type="warning">

While we are attaching policies to the EKS node group for simplicity, this
grants elevated privileges to all workloads in your cluster. 

For production, we recommend setting up an OIDC provider for your EKS cluster.
To do so, follow the instructions in the [AWS
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).

</Admonition>

Assign <Var name="role-arn" /> to the ARN of the IAM role for your EKS cluster's
node group and run the following command to attach the required policies to the
role (make sure the configuration file you generated earlier,
`kube-agent-config.yaml`, is in your working directory):

```code
$ teleport db configure bootstrap -c kube-agent-config.yaml --attach-to-role <Var name="role-arn" />
```

Enter `y` in response to the prompt to attach the policies.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/6. Start the Database Service

Start the Teleport Database Service in your environment:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Linux Host">

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Database Service"!)

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Cluster">

Create a Helm values file called `values.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
roles: "none"
authToken:
proxyAddr:
teleportConfig:
```

There are two ways to configure a Teleport service using a Helm chart:

- A static configuration file included within a Helm values file
- Fields within a values file that the Helm chart will use to generate a
  configuration file for the Teleport service

Since we have already created a Teleport configuration file in order to run
`teleport db configure bootstrap`, we will insert this into your values file.
For this to work, we need to prevent the Helm chart from validating certain
values fields. We have done this by setting `roles`, which configures the
service the Helm chart will run, to `"none"`.

Assign `authToken` to the join token you created earlier in this guide. You can
retrieve this by running the following command and copying a token with the `Db`
type:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token                            Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
-------------------------------- ---- ------ ----------------------------
(=presets.tokens.first=) Db          14 Jun 23 21:21 UTC (20m15s)
```

Assign `proxyAddr` to the host and port of your Teleport Proxy Service, e.g.,
`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

Append the Teleport configuration file you generated earlier to the values file.
It will become the value of `teleportConfig`, which the Teleport Database
Service's Helm chart will use to configure the Database Service:

```code
$ cat kube-agent-config.yaml | sed -E "s/(.*)/  \1/" >> values.yaml
```

Install the Helm chart for Teleport agent services:

```code
$ helm -n teleport install teleport-kube-agent teleport/teleport-kube-agent \
  --values values.yaml  
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Database Service will discover all RDS instances and Aurora clusters
according to the configuration and register them in the cluster. In addition to
the primary endpoints of the discovered Aurora clusters, their reader and custom
endpoints will also be registered.

The Database Service will also attempt to enable IAM authentication and
configure IAM access policies for the discovered databases. Keep in mind that
AWS IAM changes may not propagate immediately and can take a few minutes to come
into effect.

## Step 5/6. Create a database IAM user

Database users must allow IAM authentication in order to be used with Database
Access for RDS. See below how to enable it for the user `alice` on your database
engine. In the next step, we will authenticate to the database as the `alice`
user via the user's Teleport account.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="PostgreSQL">
  PostgreSQL users must have a `rds_iam` role:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER alice;
  GRANT rds_iam TO alice;
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="MySQL/MariaDB">
  MySQL and MariaDB users must have the RDS authentication plugin enabled:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER alice IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS';
  ```

  Created user may not have access to anything by default so let's grant it
  some permissions:

  ```sql
  GRANT ALL ON `%`.* TO 'alice'@'%';
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

See [Creating a database account using IAM authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html)
for more information.

## Step 6/6. Connect

Once the Database Service has started and joined the cluster, log in as the
`alice` user you created earlier to see the registered databases:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" /> --user=alice
$ tsh db ls
# Name                           Description                                   Labels
# ------------------------------ --------------------------------------------- --------
# postgres-rds                   RDS instance in us-west-1                     ...
# aurora-mysql                   Aurora cluster in us-west-1                   ...
# aurora-mysql-custom-myendpoint Aurora cluster in us-west-1 (custom endpoint) ...
# aurora-mysql-reader            Aurora cluster in us-west-1 (reader endpoint) ...
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

  Primary, reader, and custom endpoints of Aurora clusters have names with the
  format
  `<cluster-id>`, `<cluster-id>-reader`, and
  `<cluster-id>-custom-<endpoint-name>` respectively.

  You can override the `<cluster-id>` part of the name with
  `TeleportDatabaseName` AWS tag.

</Admonition>

Retrieve credentials for a database and connect to it as the `alice` user,
assigning <Var name="postgres-rds" /> to the name of a database resource listed
by `tsh db ls`:

```code
$ tsh db connect <Var name="postgres-rds" /> --db-user=alice
```

You can optionally specify the database name to use by default when connecting
to the database instance:

```code
$ tsh db connect --db-user=postgres --db-name=postgres <Var name="postgres-rds" />
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  The appropriate database command-line client (`psql`, `mysql`, `mariadb`) should be
  available in `PATH` in order to be able to connect.
</Admonition>

Log out of the database and remove credentials:

```code
$ tsh db logout <Var name="postgres-rds" /> 
```
