# Graphical Database Clients

This article describes how to configure popular graphical database clients to
work with Teleport Database Access.

## Obtain local certificate/key-pair

Issue the following command after you login with `tsh`:

```code
# View configuration for the database you're logged in to.
tsh db config
# View configuration for the specific database when you're logged into multiple.
tsh db config example
```

It will display the path to your locally cached PEM files:

```
Name:      example
Host:      teleport.example.com
Port:      3036
User:      alice
Database:
CA:        /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/certs.pem
Cert:      /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice-db/root/example-x509.pem
Key:       /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice
```

The displayed `CA`, `Cert`, and `Key` files are used to connect through pgAdmin
4, MySQL Workbench, and other graphical database clients that support mutual
TLS authentication.

## PostgreSQL pgAdmin 4

[pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a popular graphical client for
PostgreSQL servers.

To configure a new connection, right-click on "Servers" in the main browser view
and create a new server:

![pgAdmin Add Server](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-add-server@2x.png)

In the "General" tab of the new server dialog, enter the server connection name:

![pgAdmin General](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-general@2x.png)

In the "Connection" tab, enter the default database name (the *maintenance
database*) and the connection service name (the same one that you specify when
connecting through `psql`). Leave all the other fields blank:

![pgAdmin Connection](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-connection@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "SSL Mode" to `Verify-Full`:

![pgAdmin SSL](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-ssl@2x.png)

Click "Save", and pgAdmin should immediately connect.

## MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a visual tool
that provides comprehensive MySQL administration and SQL development tools.

In MySQL Workbench "Setup New Connection" dialog, fill out "Connection Name",
"Hostname", "Port", and "Username":

![MySQL Workbench
Parameters](../../../img/database-access/workbench-parameters@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "Use SSL" to `Require and Verify Identity` and enter paths
to  your CA, certificate, and private key files from `tsh db config` command:

![MySQL Workbench SSL](../../../img/database-access/workbench-ssl@2x.png)

Optionally, click "Test Connection" to verify connectivity:

![MySQL Workbench Test](../../../img/database-access/workbench-test@2x.png)

Save the connection, and connect to the database.

## MongoDB Compass

[Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) is the official MongoDB
graphical client.

On the "New Connection" panel, click on "Fill in connection fields individually".

On the "Hostname" tab, enter your Teleport proxy's hostname and port shown
by `tsh db config`. Leave "Authentication" as None.

![MongoDB Compass hostname](../../../img/database-access/compass-hostname@2x.png)

On the "More Options" tab set SSL to "Client and Server Validation" and set
CA as well as client key and certificate. Note the CA path must be provided
and be able to validate certificate presented by your Teleport proxy's web
endpoint. Client key and certificate locations are shown by `tsh db config`.

Click on the "Connect" button.
