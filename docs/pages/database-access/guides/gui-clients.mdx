This guide describes how to configure popular graphical database clients to
work with Teleport Database Access.

## Setting up your Teleport environment

### Prerequisites

Ensure that your environment includes the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss"]} label="Open Source">

- A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see one of our
  [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guides. 

- The `tsh` client tool version >= (=teleport.version=).

  ```code
  $ tsh version
  # Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
  ```

  See [Installation](/docs/installation.mdx) for details.

</TabItem>
<TabItem
  scope={["enterprise"]} label="Enterprise">

- A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our Enterprise
  [Getting Started](/docs/enterprise/getting-started) guide.

- The `tsh` client tool version >= (=teleport.version=), which you can download
  by visiting the
  [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login).

  ```code
  $ tsh version
  # Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]}
  label="Teleport Cloud">

- A Teleport Cloud account. If you do not have one, visit the
  [sign up page](https://goteleport.com/signup/) to begin your free trial.

- The `tsh` client tool version >= (=cloud.version=). To download these tools,
  visit the [Downloads](/docs/cloud/downloads) page.

  ```code
  $ tsh version
  # Teleport v(=cloud.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- The Teleport Database Service configured to access a database. See one of our
  [guides](../guides.mdx) for how to set up Teleport Database Access for your
  database.


### Get connection information

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Authenticated Proxy">
Starting the local database proxy with the `--tunnel` flag will create an
authenticated tunnel that you can use to connect to your database instances.
You won't need to configure any credentials when connecting to this tunnel.

Here is an example on how to start the proxy:

```bash
# First, login into the database.
$ tsh db login <database-name>

# Then, start the local proxy.
$ tsh proxy db --tunnel <database-name>
Started authenticated tunnel for the <engine> database "<database-name>" in cluster "<cluster-name>" on 127.0.0.1:62652.
```

You can then connect to the address the proxy command returns, in our example it
is `127.0.0.1:62652`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TLS routing">
If you're using Teleport in [TLS routing](../../setup/operations/tls-routing.mdx)
mode where each database protocol is multiplexed on the same web proxy port, use
the following command to start a local TLS proxy your GUI database client will
be connecting to:

```code
$ tsh proxy db <database-name>
Started DB proxy on 127.0.0.1:61740

Use following credentials to connect to the <database-name> proxy:
  ca_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/certs.pem
  cert_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice-db/root/<database-name>-x509.pem
  key_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice
```

Use the displayed local proxy host/port and credentials paths when configuring
your GUI client below. When entering the hostname, use `localhost` rather than
`127.0.0.1`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Separate ports">
If you're not using TLS routing, run the following command to see the database
connection information:

```code
# View configuration for the database you're logged in to.
$ tsh db config
# View configuration for the specific database when you're logged into multiple.
$ tsh db config example
```

It will display the path to your locally cached certificate and key files:

```
Name:      example
Host:      teleport.example.com
Port:      3080
User:      postgres
Database:  postgres
CA:        /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/certs.pem
Cert:      /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice-db/root/example-x509.pem
Key:       /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice
```

The displayed `CA`, `Cert`, and `Key` files are used to connect through pgAdmin
4, MySQL Workbench, and other graphical database clients that support mutual
TLS authentication.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

Use the following command to start a local TLS proxy your GUI database client
will be connecting to:

```code
$ tsh proxy db <database-name>
Started DB proxy on 127.0.0.1:61740

Use following credentials to connect to the <database-name> proxy:
  ca_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/certs.pem
  cert_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice-db/root/<database-name>-x509.pem
  key_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice
```

Use the displayed local proxy host/port and credentials paths when configuring
your GUI client below. When entering the hostname, use `localhost` rather than
`127.0.0.1`.

## PostgreSQL pgAdmin 4

[pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a popular graphical client for
PostgreSQL servers.

To configure a new connection, right-click on "Servers" in the main browser view
and create a new server:

![pgAdmin Add Server](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-add-server@2x.png)

In the "General" tab of the new server dialog, enter the server connection name:

![pgAdmin General](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-general@2x.png)

In the "Connection" tab, fill in the hostname, port, user and database name from
the configuration above:

![pgAdmin Connection](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-connection@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "SSL Mode" to `Verify-Full` and fill in paths for client
certificate, key and root certificate from the configuration above:

![pgAdmin SSL](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-ssl@2x.png)

Click "Save", and pgAdmin should immediately connect. If pgAdmin prompts you
for password, leave the password field empty and click OK.

## PostgreSQL DBeaver
To connect to your PostgreSQL instance, use the authenticated proxy address.
This is `127.0.0.1:62652` in the example above (see the “Authenticated Proxy”
section on [Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information)
for more information).

Use the "Database native" authentication with an empty password:

![DBeaver Postgres Configure
Server](../../../img/database-access/dbeaver-pg-configure-server.png)

Clicking on "Test connection" should return a connection success message. Then,
click on "Finish" to save the configuration.

## MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a GUI
application that provides comprehensive MySQL administration and SQL development
tools.

In the MySQL Workbench "Setup New Connection" dialog, fill out "Connection
Name", "Hostname", "Port", and "Username":

![MySQL Workbench
Parameters](../../../img/database-access/workbench-parameters@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "Use SSL" to `Require and Verify Identity` and enter the
paths to your CA, certificate, and private key files (see
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information)):

![MySQL Workbench SSL](../../../img/database-access/workbench-ssl@2x.png)

Optionally, click "Test Connection" to verify connectivity:

![MySQL Workbench Test](../../../img/database-access/workbench-test@2x.png)

Save the connection and connect to the database.

## MySQL DBeaver

Right-click in the "Database Navigator" menu in the main view and select Create > Connection:

![DBeaver Add Server](../../../img/database-access/dbeaver-add-server.png)

In the search bar of the "Connect to a database" window that opens up, type "mysql", select the MySQL driver, and click "Next":

![DBeaver Select Driver](../../../img/database-access/dbeaver-select-driver.png)

In the newly-opened "Connection Settings" tab, use the Host as `localhost` and
Port as the one returned by the proxy command (`62652` in the example above):

![DBeaver Select Configure Server](../../../img/database-access/dbeaver-configure-server.png)

In that same tab, set the username to match the one that you are connecting to
using Teleport and uncheck the "Save password locally" box:

![DBeaver Select Configure User](../../../img/database-access/dbeaver-configure-user.png)

Click the "Edit Driver Settings" button on the "Main" tab, check the "No
Authentication" box, and click "Ok" to save:

![DBeaver Driver Settings](../../../img/database-access/dbeaver-driver-settings.png)

Once you are back in the "Connection Settings" window, click "Ok" to finish and
DBeaver should connect to the remote MySQL server automatically.

## MongoDB Compass

[Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) is the official MongoDB
graphical client.

On the "New Connection" panel, click on "Fill in connection fields individually".

![MongoDB Compass new connection](../../../img/database-access/compass-new-connection@2x.png)

On the "Hostname" tab, enter the hostname and port of the proxy you will use to
access the database (see
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information)).
Leave "Authentication" as None.

![MongoDB Compass hostname](../../../img/database-access/compass-hostname@2x.png)

On the "More Options" tab, set SSL to "Client and Server Validation" and set the
CA as well as the client key and certificate. Note that a CA path must be
provided and be able to validate the certificate presented by your Teleport
Proxy Service's web endpoint.

![MongoDB Compass more options](../../../img/database-access/compass-more-options@2x.png)

Click on the "Connect" button.

## SQL Server DBeaver

In the DBeaver connection configuration menu, use your proxy's endpoint. This is
`localhost:62652` in the example above. (See
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information) for
more information.)

Use the SQL Server Authentication option and keep the Password field empty:

![DBeaver connection options](../../../img/database-access/guides/sqlserver/dbeaver-connection@2x.png)

Click OK to connect.

## SQL Server DataGrip

In the DataGrip connection configuration menu, use your proxy's endpoint. This
is `localhost:4242` in the example below. (See
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information) for
more information.)

Select the "User & Password" authentication option and keep the "Password" field
empty:

![DataGrip connection options](../../../img/database-access/guides/sqlserver/datagrip-connection@2x.png)

Click "OK" to connect.

## Redis Insight

<Admonition type="note">
  Teleport's Redis Insight integration only supports Redis standalone instances.
</Admonition>

After opening Redis Insight click `ADD REDIS DATABASE`.

![Redis Insight Startup Screen](../../../img/database-access/guides/redis/redisinsight-startup.png)

Log in to your Redis instance with a Redis user first by using:

`tsh db login --db-user=alice redis-db-name`.

Click `Add Database Manually`. Use `127.0.0.1` as the `Host`. Use the port printed by
the `tsh` command you ran in [Get connection information](#get-connection-information).

Provide your Redis username as `Username` and password as `Password`.

![Redis Insight Configuration](../../../img/database-access/guides/redis/redisinsight-add-config.png)

Next, check the `Use TLS` and `Verify TLS Certificates` boxes and copy the CA certificate returned by `tsh proxy db`.
Copy the private key and certificate to corresponding fields.

Click `Add Redis Database`.

![Redis Insight TLS Configuration](../../../img/database-access/guides/redis/redisinsight-tls-config.png)

Congratulations! You have just connected to your Redis instance.
