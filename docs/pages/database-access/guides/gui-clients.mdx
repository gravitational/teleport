# Graphical Database Clients

This article describes how to configure popular graphical database clients to work with Teleport Database Access.

## Obtain local certificate/key-pair

Issue the following command after you login through `tsh`:

```bash
tsh db config
tsh db config --db=example
```

It will display the path to your locally cached PEM files:

```
# Output
Name:      aurora
Host:      root.gravitational.io
Port:      3036
User:      r0mant
Database:
CA:        /Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/certs.pem
Cert:      /Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/r0mant-db/root/aurora-x509.pem
Key:       /Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/r0mant
```

The displayed `CA`, `Cert`, and `Key` files are used to connect through pgAdmin 4 and MySQL Workbench.

## pgAdmin 4

[pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a popular graphical client for PostgreSQL servers.

To configure a new connection, right-click on "Servers" in the main browser view and create a new server:

![pgAdmin Add Server](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-add-server@2x.png)

In the "General" tab of the new server dialog, enter the server connection name:

![pgAdmin General](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-general@2x.png)

In the "Connection" tab, enter the default database name (the *maintenance database*) and the connection service name (the same one that you specify when connecting through `psql`). Leave all the other fields blank:

![pgAdmin Connection](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-connection@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "SSL Mode" to `Verify-Full`:

![pgAdmin SSL](../../../img/database-access/pgadmin-ssl@2x.png)

Click "Save", and pgAdmin should immediately connect.

## MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a visual tool that provides comprehensive MySQL administration and SQL development tools.

In MySQL Workbench "Setup New Connection" dialog, fill out "Connection Name", "Hostname", "Port", and "Username":

![MySQL Workbench Parameters](../../../img/database-access/workbench-parameters@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "Use SSL" to `Require and Verify Identity` and enter paths to  your CA, certificate, and private key files from `tsh db config` command:

Optionally, click "Test Connection" to verify connectivity:

![MySQL Workbench Test](../../../img/database-access/workbench-test@2x.png)

Save the connection, and connect to the database.
