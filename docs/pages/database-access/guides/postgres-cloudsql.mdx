# GCP Cloud SQL PostgreSQL

## Enable Cloud SQL IAM Authentication

Teleport uses [IAM database authentication](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/authentication)
with Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instances.

If you're [creating](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/choose-instance-engine)
a new PostgreSQL instance, make sure to add the `cloudsql.iam_authentication`
database flag under "Customize your instance / Flags" section:

![Enable IAM Authentication](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/iam-new-instance@2x.png)

To check whether IAM authentication is enabled for an existing Cloud SQL instance,
look for the flag on the Configuration panel on the instance's Overview page:

![Check IAM Authentication](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/iam-existing-instance@2x.png)

If it isn't enabled, you can add this flag using the "Edit configuration" dialog
at the bottom of the Configuration panel. Note, changing this setting may
require a database instance reboot.

## Create Service Account for Database

Teleport uses service accounts to connect to Cloud SQL databases.

Go to the IAM & Admin [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
page and create a new service account:

![Create Service Account](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-db@2x.png)

Press "Create".

On the second step grant this service account the "Cloud SQL Instance User" role
which will allow it to connect to Cloud SQL instances using IAM token for
authentication:

![Grant Cloud SQL Instance User to Service Account](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-db-grant@2x.png)

Press "Done".

Now go back to the Users page of your Cloud SQL instance and add a new user
account. In the sidebar, choose "Cloud IAM" authentication type and add the
service account you've just created:

![Add Cloud SQL User Account](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/add-user-account@2x.png)

Press "Add" and your Users table should look similar to this:

![Cloud SQL User Accounts Table](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/user-accounts@2x.png)

See [Creating and managing IAM users](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-manage-iam-users)
in Google Cloud documentation for more info.

## Create Service Account for Teleport Database Service

The final part of GCP configuration is to create another service account with
"Service Account Token Creator" permission, or modify an existing one to add it.
This will let Teleport Database Service generate an IAM auth token when
connecting to the database as a service account user we created above.

If creating a new one, go to the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
page and create another service account:

![Create Service Account](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-db-service@2x.png)

Assign it the "Service Account Token Creator" role:

![Grant Service Account Token Creator to Service Account](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-db-service-grant@2x.png)

Once created, go to that service account's Keys tab and create a new key:

![Service Account Keys](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-keys@2x.png)

Make sure to choose JSON format:

![Service Account New Key](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/service-account-new-key@2x.png)

Save the file, your Teleport Database Service will need it to be able to generate
IAM auth tokens.

## Gather Cloud SQL Instance Information

To connect a Cloud SQL database to Teleport, you'll need to gather a few pieces
of information about the instance.

- GCP Project ID.

You can normally see it in the organization view at the top of the GCP dashboard.

- Cloud SQL instance ID.

The instance ID is the name of your Cloud SQL instance shown at the top of the
Overview page:

![Instance ID](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/instance-id@2x.png)

- Cloud SQL instance endpoint.

You will use the instance's public IP address to connect to it. It can be viewed
on the "Connect to this instance" panel on the Overview page:

![Instance Public IP](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/instance-public-ip@2x.png)

- Cloud SQL instance root certificate.

The instance's root certificate is required so Teleport can validate the
certificate presented by the database instance. You can download `server-ca.pem`
file from the Connections tab under Security section:

![Instance Root Certificate](../../../img/database-access/guides/cloudsql/instance-root-ca@2x.png)

## Setup Teleport Auth and Proxy Services

Cloud SQL support for Teleport Database Access is available starting from
`6.1` release. Download the appropriate version of Teleport for your platform from
our [downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download).

Teleport requires a valid TLS certificate to operate and can fetch one automatically
using Let's Encrypt [ACME](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/) protocol.

We will assume that you have configured DNS records for `teleport.example.com`
and `*.teleport.example.com` to point to the Teleport node.

Let's generate a Teleport config with ACME enabled:

```shell
$ teleport configure --cluster-name=teleport.example.com --acme --acme-email=alice@example.com -o file
```

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Web Proxy Port"
>
  Teleport uses [TLS-ALPN-01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#tls-alpn-01)
  ACME challenge to validate certificate requests which only works on port `443`.
  As such, in order to use ACME for certificate management, web proxy needs to
  be accessible on port `443`.
</Admonition>

Start the service:

```sh
$ sudo teleport start
```

Generate a short-lived join token for the database service and save it for
example in `/tmp/token`:

```sh
$ tctl tokens add \
    --type=db \
    --db-name=test \
    --db-protocol=postgres \
    --db-uri=35.1.2.3:5432
```

### Create User

Create local Teleport user with the built-in `access` role:

```sh
$ tctl users add --roles=access alice
```

The `access` role allows users to see all connected database servers, but
database names and accounts are restricted to the user's `db_names` and
`db_users` traits. Normally, these traits come from the identity provider. For
the local user you've just created you can update them manually to allow it to
connect to the `postgres` database as a `teleport@<project-id>.iam` database
service account.

First, export the user resource:

```sh
$ tctl get users/alice > alice.yaml
```

Update the resource to include the following traits:

```yaml
traits:
  # Database account names the user will be allowed to use.
  # Note: replace <project-id> with your GCP project ID.
  db_users:
  - teleport@<project-id>.iam
  # Database names the user will be allowed to connect to.
  db_names:
  - postgres
```

Update the user:

```sh
$ tctl create alice.yaml -f
```

For more detailed information about database access controls see [RBAC](../rbac.mdx)
documentation.

## Setup Teleport Database Service

Below is an example of a database service configuration file that proxies
a single Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database:

```yaml
teleport:
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport-db
  nodename: test
  # Proxy address to connect to. Note that it has to be the proxy address
  # because database service always connects to the cluster over reverse
  # tunnel.
  auth_servers:
  - teleport.example.com:3080
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  # This section contains definitions of all databases proxied by this
  # service, can contain multiple items.
  databases:
    # Name of the database proxy instance, used to reference in CLI.
  - name: "cloudsql"
    # Free-form description of the database proxy instance.
    description: "GCP Cloud SQL PostgreSQL"
    # Database protocol.
    protocol: "postgres"
    # Database endpoint. For Cloud SQL use instance's public IP address.
    uri: "35.1.2.3:5432"
    # Path to Cloud SQL instance root certificate you downloaded above.
    ca_cert_file: /path/to/cloudsql/instance/root.pem
    # GCP specific configuration when connecting Cloud SQL instance.
    gcp:
      # GCP project ID.
      project_id: "<project-id>"
      # Cloud SQL instance ID.
      instance_id: "test"
    # Labels to assign to the database, used in RBAC.
    static_labels:
      env: dev
auth_service:
  enabled: "no"
ssh_service:
  enabled: "no"
proxy_service:
  enabled: "no"
```

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  A single Teleport process can run multiple different services, for example
  multiple database access proxies as well as running other services such an
  SSH service or an application access proxy.
</Admonition>

Start the database service:

```sh
$ teleport start --config=/path/to/teleport-db.yaml --token=/tmp/token
```

### GCP Credentials

Teleport Database Service must have credentials of `teleport-db-service` GCP
service account we created [above](#create-service-account-for-teleport-database-service)
in order to be able to generate IAM auth tokens.

The easiest way to ensure that is to set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
environment variable to point to the JSON credentials file you downloaded
earlier.

See [Authenticating as a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production)
in Google Cloud documentation for more details.

## Connect

Once the database service has joined the cluster, login to see the available
databases:

```sh
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com:3080 --user=alice
$ tsh db ls
Name     Description              Labels
-------- ------------------------ --------
cloudsql GCP Cloud SQL PostgreSQL env=dev
```

Note that you will only be able to see databases your role has access to. See
[RBAC](../rbac.mdx) section for more details.

To connect to a particular database server, first retrieve credentials from
Teleport using `tsh db login` command:

```sh
$ tsh db login cloudsql
```

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  You can be logged into multiple databases simultaneously.
</Admonition>

You can optionally specify the database name and the user to use by default
when connecting to the database instance:

```sh
$ tsh db login --db-user=teleport@<project-id>.iam --db-name=postgres cloudsql
```

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="What database user name to use?"
>
  When connecting to the database, use the name of the database service account
  that you added as IAM database user [above](#create-service-account-for-database),
  minus the `.gserviceaccount.com` suffix. The database user name is shown on
  the Users page of your Cloud SQL instance.
</Admonition>

When logging into a PostgreSQL database, `tsh` automatically configures a section
in the [connection service file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgservice.html)
with the name of `<cluster-name>-<database-service-name>`.

Suppose the cluster name is "teleport.example.com", then you can connect to the
database using the following `psql` command:

```sh
# Use default database user and database name.
$ psql "service=teleport.example.com-cloudsql"
# Specify database user and database name explicitly.
$ psql "service=teleport.example.com-cloudsql user=teleport@<project-id>.iam dbname=postgres"
```

To log out of the database and remove credentials:

```sh
# Remove credentials for a particular database instance.
$ tsh db logout cloudsql
# Remove credentials for all database instances.
$ tsh db logout
```
