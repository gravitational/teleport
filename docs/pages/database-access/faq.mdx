## Are database sessions listed under recorded sessions?

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/db-audit-events.mdx!)

## Can database clients use a public address different from the web public address?

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

When configuring the Teleport Proxy Service, administrators can set the
`postgres_public_addr` and `mysql_public_addr` configuration fields to public
addresses over which respective database clients should connect. See
[Proxy Configuration](./reference/configuration.mdx#proxy-configuration) for
more details.

This is useful when the Teleport Web UI is running behind an L7 load balancer
(e.g. ALB in AWS), in which case the PostgreSQL/MySQL proxy needs to be exposed
on a plain TCP load balancer (e.g. NLB in AWS).

<TabItem scope={["cloud","team"]} label="Cloud-Hosted">

In Teleport Enterprise Cloud, the Proxy Service uses the following ports for
Database Service client traffic:

|Configuration setting|Port|
|---|---|
|`mysql_public_addr`|`3036`|
|`postgres_public_addr`|`443`|
|`mongo_public_addr`|`443`|

## Can I provide a custom CA certificate?

Yes, you can pass custom CA certificate by using a
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration)
(look at `ca_cert_file`).

## Can I provide a custom DNS name for Teleport generated CA?

Yes, use `server_name` under the `tls` section in your Teleport configuration
file. Please look on our reference
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration)
for more details.

## Can I disable CA verification when connecting to a database?

Yes, although it is not recommended. Certificate verification prevents
person-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure that you
are connected to the database that you intended to. 

Teleport also allows you to edit your
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration)
to provide a custom CA certificate (`ca_cert_file`) or custom DNS name
(`server_name`), which is more secure. 

If none of the above options work for you and you still want to disable the CA
check, you can use `mode` under the `tls` option in the Teleport configuration file.

For more details please refer to the reference
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration).

## Can I disable read-only and custom endpoints from auto-discovered databases?

Yes, you can use the Teleport generated label `endpoint-type` on your `aws`
matcher to filter the endpoints. For example, to disable read-only and custom
endpoints for RDS auto-discovery, you can specify other endpoint types to
match:
```
  aws:
  - types: ["rds"]
    regions: ["us-west-1"]
    tags:
      "env": "dev"
      "endpoint-type":
        - "primary"
        - "instance"
```

See [labels reference](./reference/labels.mdx) for a full list of Teleport
generated labels and values.
