# Database Access FAQ

## Which database protocols does Teleport Database Access support?

Teleport Database Access currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB
protocols.

For PostgreSQL and MySQL, both self-hosted and cloud-hosted versions such as AWS
RDS, Aurora (except for Serverless version which doesn't support IAM auth),
Redshift, and GCP Cloud SQL are supported. See available [guides](./guides.mdx)
for all supported configurations.

## Which PostgreSQL protocol features are not supported?

The following PostgreSQL protocol features aren't currently supported:

- [Canceling requests in progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.5.7.9).
  Cancel requests issued by the PostgreSQL clients connected to Teleport proxy
  won't be passed to the database server.
- Any of the [authentication methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html)
  except for client certificate authentication and IAM authentication for cloud
  databases.

## Can database clients use public address different from web public address?

Teleport administrators can set `postgres_public_addr` and `mysql_public_addr`
proxy configuration fields to public addresses over which respective database
clients should connect. See [Proxy Configuration](./reference/configuration.mdx#proxy-configuration)
for more details.

This is useful when Teleport web proxy UI is running behind an L7 load balancer
(e.g. ALB in AWS) in which case PostgreSQL/MySQL proxy need to be exposed on a
plain TCP load balancer (e.g. NLB in AWS).

## Do you support X database client?

Teleport relies on client certificates for authentication so any database client
that supports this method of authentication and uses modern TLS (1.2+) should
work.

Standard command-line clients such as `psql`, `mysql`, or `mongo` are supported,
there are also instructions for configuring select [graphical clients](./guides/gui-clients.mdx).

## When will you support X database?

We plan to support more databases in the future based on customer demand.

See if the database you're interested in has already been requested among
[Github issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/labels/database-access)
or open a [new issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new/choose)
to register your interest.
