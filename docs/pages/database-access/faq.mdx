# Database Access FAQ

## Which database protocols does Teleport Database Access support?

Teleport Database Access currently supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and MongoDB
protocols.

For PostgreSQL and MySQL, both self-hosted and cloud-hosted versions such as AWS
RDS, Aurora (except for Serverless version which doesn't support IAM auth),
Redshift, and GCP Cloud SQL are supported. See available [guides](./guides.mdx)
for all supported configurations.

## Which PostgreSQL protocol features are not supported?

The following PostgreSQL protocol features aren't currently supported:

- [Canceling requests in progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.5.7.9).
  Cancel requests issued by the PostgreSQL clients connected to Teleport proxy
  won't be passed to the database server.
- Any of the [authentication methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html)
  except for client certificate authentication and IAM authentication for cloud
  databases.

## Can database clients use public address different from web public address?

Teleport administrators can set `postgres_public_addr` and `mysql_public_addr`
proxy configuration fields to public addresses over which respective database
clients should connect. See [Proxy Configuration](./reference/configuration.mdx#proxy-configuration)
for more details.

This is useful when Teleport web proxy UI is running behind an L7 load balancer
(e.g. ALB in AWS) in which case PostgreSQL/MySQL proxy need to be exposed on a
plain TCP load balancer (e.g. NLB in AWS).

## Do you support X database client?

Teleport relies on client certificates for authentication so any database client
that supports this method of authentication and uses modern TLS (1.2+) should
work.

Standard command-line clients such as `psql`, `mysql`, `mongo` or `mongosh` are supported,
there are also instructions for configuring select [graphical clients](./guides/gui-clients.mdx).

## When will you support X database?

We plan to support more databases in the future based on customer demand.

See if the database you're interested in has already been requested among
[Github issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/labels/database-access)
or open a [new issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new/choose)
to register your interest.

## Can I provide a custom CA certificate?

Yes, you can pass custom CA certificate by using
[configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration)
(look at `ca_cert_file`).

## Can I provide a custom DNS name for Teleport generated CA?

Yes, use `server_name` under `tls` section in configuration file. Please look on our
reference [configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration)
for more details.

## Can I disable CA verification when connecting to database?

Yes, although is not recommended. Certificate verification prevents from man in the middle attack
and makes sure that you are connected to the database that you intended to. Teleport also allows to
provide a [custom CA certificate](#can-i-provide-a-custom-ca-certificate) or
[custom DNS name](#can-i-provide-a-custom-dns-name-for-teleport-generated-ca) which is more secure.
If none of the above options don't work for you and you still want to disable the CA check
you can use `mode` under `tls` option in the Teleport configuration file. For more details please refer
to the reference [configuration file](./reference/configuration.mdx#database-service-configuration).
