# Database Access FAQ

## Which database protocols does Teleport Database Access support?

Teleport Database Access currently supports PostgreSQL and MySQL protocols.

## Which PostgreSQL protocol features are not supported?

The following PostgreSQL protocol features aren't currently supported:

* [Canceling requests in progress](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#id-1.10.5.7.9).
  Cancel requests issued by the PostgreSQL clients connected to Teleport proxy
  won't be passed to the database server.
* Any of the [authentication methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html)
  except for client certificate authentication and IAM authentication for AWS
  RDS and Aurora databases.

## Do you support X database client?

Teleport relies on client certificates for authentication so any database client
that supports this method of authentication and uses modern TLS (1.2+) should
work.

Standard command-line clients such as `psql` and `mysql` are supported, there
are also instructions for configuring select [graphical clients](./guides/gui-clients.mdx).

## When will you support X database?

We're focusing on PostgreSQL and MySQL initially but planning to support more
databases in the future based on the customer demand.

See if the database you're interested in has already been requested among
[Github issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/labels/database-access)
or open a [new issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new/choose)
to register your interest.
