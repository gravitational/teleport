  Automatic user provisioning for PostgreSQL is available starting from

</Details>

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning-intro.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster with a configured [self-hosted PostgreSQL](../guides/postgres-self-hosted.mdx)
  or [RDS PostgreSQL](../guides/rds.mdx) database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning-configure-admin.mdx!)

Teleport will use the same authentication mechanism when connecting as an admin
user as for regular user connections: X.509 for self-hosted databases and AWS
IAM for RDS. The admin user must have privileges within the database to create
users and grant them privileges.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="RDS PostgreSQL">
The RDS PostgreSQL admin user must have the `rds_iam` role attached to allow IAM
authentication:

```sql
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" login createrole;
GRANT rds_iam TO "teleport-admin";
```

Note that the RDS database must have IAM authentication enabled.

Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html) to make sure you are using the `rds_iam` role correctly.
for more information.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Self-hosted PostgreSQL">
The self-hosted PostgreSQL admin user must have X.509 authentication configured.

```sql
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" login createrole;
```

Note that the database must be configured to accept client certificate auth
for the admin user by having the following entries in `pg_hba.conf`:

```conf
hostssl all             all             ::/0                    cert
hostssl all             all             0.0.0.0/0               cert
```

Refer to the [self-hosted PostgreSQL guide](../guides/postgres-self-hosted.mdx#step-35-configure-your-postgresql-server)
to ensure that your configuration is correct.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Users created by Teleport will be placed in the `teleport-auto-user` group in
the database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Next, enable the database admin on the Teleport database configuration:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Static config">
```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  - name: "example"
    protocol: "postgres"
    uri: "localhost:5432"
    admin_user:
      name: "teleport-admin"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dynamic resource">
```yaml
kind: db
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  protocol: "postgres"
  uri: "localhost:5432"
  admin_user:
    name: "teleport-admin"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Auto-discovered databases">
For auto-discovered cloud databases, the name of the admin user is taken from
the `teleport.dev/db-admin` label.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/3. Configure Teleport role

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning-common-teleport-role.mdx!)

Users created within the database will:

- Have the same name as Teleport username.
- Be a part of the `teleport-auto-user` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database. See PostgreSQL
  [CREATE ROLE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html)
  for information on how to create database roles.

Note that in case of a name conflict where a user with the same name already
exists in the database and is not managed by Teleport (i.e. not a part of the
`teleport-auto-user` group), the connection will be aborted.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning-connect.mdx gui="pgAdmin"!)

## Next steps

- Connect using your [GUI database
  client](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).
- Learn about [role
  templating](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx#interpolation-rules).
- Read automatic user provisioning
  [RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0113-automatic-database-users.md).
- The `{{internal.db_roles}}` template variables we illustrated in this guide
  are replaced with values from the Teleport local user database. For full
  details on how variable expansion works in Teleport roles, see the  [Teleport
  Access Controls Reference](docs/pages/access-controls/reference.mdx#roles).
