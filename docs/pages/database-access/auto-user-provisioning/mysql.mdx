  Automatic user provisioning for MySQL is available starting from Teleport
  14.1.
</Details>

## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster with a configured [self-hosted MySQL](../guides/mysql-self-hosted.mdx)
  or [RDS MySQL](../guides/rds.mdx) database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

<Admonition type="note" title="Supported versions">
Automatic user provisioning are not compatible with MySQL versions lower than
8.0.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning-configure-admin.mdx!)

Teleport use the same authentication mechanism when connecting as an admin user
as for regular user connections: X.509 for self-hosted databases and AWS IAM
for RDS.

The admin user must have privileges within the database to create users and
grant them privileges. The admin user must also have privileges to monitor user
processes and role assignments.

In addition, a database/schema is required for the admin user to logs into by
default. Stored procedures are also created and executed from this database.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="RDS MySQL">
The RDS MySQL admin user must use `AWSAuthenticationPlugin` to allow IAM
authentication:
```sql
CREATE USER 'teleport-admin' IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.role_edges TO 'teleport-admin' ;
GRANT PROCESS, ROLE_ADMIN, CREATE USER ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `teleport`;
GRANT ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE ROUTINE, EXECUTE ON `teleport`.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Self-hosted MySQL">
The self-hosted MySQL admin user must have X.509 authentication configured:
```sql
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" REQUIRE SUBJECT "/CN=teleport-admin";
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.role_edges TO 'teleport-admin' ;
GRANT PROCESS, ROLE_ADMIN, CREATE USER ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `teleport`;
GRANT ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE ROUTINE, EXECUTE ON `teleport`.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Users created by Teleport will be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role in the
database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

Teleport will not delete the automatically created user at the end of the
session. Instead, the user will be stripped of all roles and the user account
will be locked.

Next, enable the database admin on the Teleport database configuration:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Static config">
```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  - name: "example"
    protocol: "mysql"
    uri: "localhost:3306"
    admin_user:
      name: "teleport-admin"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dynamic resource">
```yaml
kind: db
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  protocol: "mysql"
  uri: "localhost:3306"
  admin_user:
    name: "teleport-admin"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Auto-discovered databases">
For auto-discovered cloud databases, the name of the admin user is taken from
the `teleport.dev/db-admin` label.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/3. Configure Teleport role

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning-common-teleport-role.mdx!)

User created within the database will:

- Be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database.

MySQL limits username up to 32 characters long. When the Teleport username is
within this limit, the user created within the database will have the same name
as the Teleport username.

When the Teleport username is over the 32 characters limit, the user created
within the database will have the name in the format of
`tp-<base64-sha1-teleport-username>`.

<Details title="Tracking the name mapping">
The original Teleport username will be saved as user attributes within the
databases.

User can find its own attributes in an auto-provisioned database session by:
```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES WHERE CONCAT(USER, '@', HOST) = current_user(); 
```

Database admins can search a particular Teleport username by:
```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES WHERE ATTRIBUTE->"$.user" = "teleport-user-name";
```

In addition, the "hashed" in-database name will be recorded as `db_user` for
database queries in the Teleport Audit Logs, when the Teleport username is over
32 characters.
</Details>

Note that in case of a name conflict where a user with the same name already
exists in the database and is not managed by Teleport (i.e. not assigned the
`teleport-auto-user` role), the connection will be aborted.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning-connect.mdx gui="MySQL Workbench"!)

## Next steps

- Connect using your [GUI database client](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).
- Learn about [role templating](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx#interpolation-rules).
- Read automatic user provisioning [RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0113-automatic-database-users.md).
