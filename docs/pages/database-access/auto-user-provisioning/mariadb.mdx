(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/intro.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster v14.1.3 or higher with a configured [self-hosted
  MariaDB](../guides/mysql-self-hosted.mdx) or [RDS MariaDB](../guides/rds.mdx)
  database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

<Admonition type="note" title="Supported versions">
Automatic user provisioning is not compatible with MariaDB versions lower than
10.3.3 or 10.2.11.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/configure-admin.mdx!)

Teleport uses the same authentication mechanism when connecting as an admin
user as for regular user connections: X.509 for self-hosted databases and AWS
IAM for RDS.

The admin user must have privileges within the database to create users and
grant them privileges. The admin user must also have privileges to monitor user
processes and role assignments.

In addition, a schema is required for the admin user to log into by default.
This schema is also used to store custom user attributes and stored procedures.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="RDS MariaDB">
The RDS MariaDB admin user must use `AWSAuthenticationPlugin` to allow IAM
authentication:
```sql
CREATE USER 'teleport-admin' IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS';
GRANT PROCESS, CREATE USER ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.roles_mapping TO 'teleport-admin';
GRANT UPDATE ON mysql.* TO 'teleport-admin'; -- For SET DEFAULT ROLE FOR
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin'; -- Required when using best_effort_drop mode for checking if users own resources before dropping them.

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `teleport`;
GRANT ALL ON `teleport`.* TO 'teleport-admin' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Note that Teleport uses `teleport` as the name of the default schema but the
name is configurable in the Teleport database definition. Replace the database
name in the last two lines if you wish to use another database name.

<Admonition type="warning" title ="Role Admin">
In order for the admin user to grant a role to a database user, they must be
the "Admin" of the role.

One way to achieve this is to create roles as the admin user, which
automatically designates the admin user as "Admin" of those roles.

Alternatively, you can assign the admin user as the "Admin" of existing roles:
```sql
UPDATE mysql.roles_mapping SET User ='teleport-admin' WHERE Admin_option='Y' AND Role='role1';
```

Replace `role1` with the name of the role that will be granted to
auto-provisioned users.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Self-hosted MariaDB">
The self-hosted MariaDB admin user must have X.509 authentication configured:
```sql
CREATE USER 'teleport-admin' REQUIRE SUBJECT '/CN=teleport-admin';
GRANT PROCESS, CREATE USER ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.roles_mapping TO 'teleport-admin';
GRANT UPDATE ON mysql.* TO 'teleport-admin'; -- For SET DEFAULT ROLE FOR
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin'; -- Required when using best_effort_drop mode for checking if users own resources before dropping them.

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `teleport`;
GRANT ALL ON `teleport`.* TO 'teleport-admin' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Note that Teleport uses `teleport` as the name of the default schema but the
name is configurable in the Teleport database definition. Replace the database
name in the last two lines if you wish to use another database name.

<Admonition type="warning" title ="Role Admin">
In order for the admin user to grant a role to a database user, they must be
the "Admin" of the role.

One way to achieve this is to use the `WITH ADMIN` option when creating roles:
```sql
CREATE ROLE role1 WITH ADMIN 'teleport-admin';
```

Alternatively, you can assign the admin user as the "Admin" of existing roles:
```sql
UPDATE mysql.roles_mapping SET User ='teleport-admin' WHERE Admin_option='Y' AND Role='role1';
```

Replace `role1` with the name of the role that will be granted to
auto-provisioned users.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Users created by Teleport will be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role in the
database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

During a MariaDB session, only one role is allowed to be active at a time.
Teleport creates an all-in-one role `tp-role-<user>` and assigns it to the
created user. The true roles are then assigned to this all-in-one role and the
all-in-one role is set as the default role.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/db-definition-default-dbname.mdx protocol="mysql" uri="localhost:3306" !)

## Step 2/3. Configure a Teleport role

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/common-teleport-role.mdx!)

Users created within the database will:

- Be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database. The admin user must
  be the "Admin" of these roles. See "Role Admin" section above for more
  details.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/username-hash.mdx database="MariaDB" limit="80" !)

<Details title="Tracking the name mapping">
The original Teleport username will be saved as user attributes in the
`user_attributes` table in the default database.

Database admins can search a particular Teleport username by:
```sql
SELECT * FROM teleport.user_attributes WHERE JSON_VALUE(Attributes,"$.user") = "teleport-user-name";
```

In addition, the "hashed" in-database name will be set as `db_user` for
database queries in the Teleport Audit Logs, when the Teleport username is over
80 characters.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/connect.mdx gui="MySQL Workbench"!)

## Troubleshooting

### Use your mapped remote username error

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/troubleshooting-remote-username.mdx!)

## Next steps

- Connect using your [GUI database client](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).
- Learn about [role templating](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx#interpolation-rules).
- Read automatic user provisioning [RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0113-automatic-database-users.md).
