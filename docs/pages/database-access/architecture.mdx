# Database Access Architecture

This section provides an overview of Teleport Database Access inner workings.

## How it works

Let's take a look at a sample Database Access deployment:

![Teleport Database Access Diagram](../../img/database-access/diagram.png)

In it, we have the following Teleport components:

- [Teleport Proxy](../architecture/proxy.mdx). A stateless service
  that performs a function of an authentication gateway, serves web UI and
  accepts database (and other) client connections.
- [Teleport Auth](../architecture/authentication.mdx). Serves as
  cluster's certificate authority, handles user authentication/authorization
  and issues short-lived client certificates.
- Teleport Database Service. The Database Access' "brain" that connects
  to the databases, performs database authentication and protocol parsing.

Database Service establishes an SSH reverse tunnel to the Proxy. As such, users
do not need to have direct connectivity to the Database Service, or the databases
it's connected to. As long as it can dial back to the cluster's Proxy server, it
can be located behind a firewall.

  You can have multiple Database Services connected to the cluster. Each
  Database Service can be also connected to multiple databases.

Let's take a look at the typical flow Database Access users go through to
connect to a database.

1. A user logs into the cluster with `tsh login` command and retrieves
   a client certificate. See [Issuing User Certificates](../architecture/authentication.mdx#issuing-user-certificates)
   for more details on how it works.
2. The user picks the database they want to connect to from the list of available
   databases shown in `tsh db ls` command and retrieves a short-lived X.509
   certificate for it with `tsh db login`.
3. The user uses a standard database client (e.g. `psql`, `mysql` or one of the
   [graphical clients](./guides/gui-clients.mdx)) to connect to the Proxy, authenticating
   with the client certificate from step 2.
4. The Proxy authenticates the connection and dispatches it to the appropriate
   Database Service based on the routing information encoded in the client
   certificate, over the reverse tunnel.
5. The Database Service authenticates the connection, performs an authorization
   check, and then establishes the connection to the database.
6. The Database Service begins proxying traffic between the user's database
   client and the database. Additionally, it interprets the database wire
   protocol messages and submits events to the Teleport audit log.

## Authentication

Teleport relies on short-lived X.509 certificates for user authentication, as
well as authentication between internal components.

Authentication happens in 3 places:

- Database client connecting to Proxy
- Proxy connecting to Database Service
- Database Service connecting database.

Let's take a detailed look at each authentication point.

### Database client to Proxy

Database clients authenticate with the Proxy using X.509 client certificates
obtained from the `tsh db login` command.

  Many database clients/servers refer to these certificates as SSL which is
  legacy terminology. In Teleport documentation we most often refer to them as
  TLS or x509 certificates.
</Admonition>

The login command updates database-specific local configuration files (e.g.
PostgreSQL [connection service file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-pgservice.html)
or MySQL [option file](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html)
to group connection information for a particular database, which CLI clients
can refer to.

For configuring graphical clients, there is a `tsh db config` command that
prints detailed information about the connection such as host/port and location
of the secrets. See [GUI Clients](./guides/gui-clients.mdx) for details.

### Proxy to Database service

The connection between the Proxy and the Database Service is also authenticated
with mutual TLS.

The Proxy generates a short-lived X.509 certificate signed by the
cluster's host authority, with the client's identity and database routing
information encoded in it, and uses it to authenticate with the Database Service.

### Database service to database

Database authentication is handled differently for self-hosted databases and
databases hosted by AWS.

#### Self-hosted

Teleport Database Service uses client certificate authentication with self-hosted
database servers.

See respective configuration guides for [PostgreSQL](./guides/postgres-self-hosted.mdx)
and [MySQL](./guides/mysql-self-hosted.mdx) for details on configuring client certificate
authentication.

#### AWS RDS / Aurora

With RDS and Aurora database instances, the Database Service authenticates using
[IAM Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html).

The Database Service automatically generates an IAM token for each connection
and uses the token as a password.

See respective configuration guides for [PostgreSQL](./guides/postgres-aws.mdx) and
[MySQL](./guides/mysql-aws.mdx) for details on configuring IAM authentication.
