description: Teleport database access introduction, demo and resources.

Teleport can provide secure connections to your databases while improving both
access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with database access:

- Enable users to retrieve short-lived database certificates using a Single Sign-On
  flow, thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [Access Request](../access-controls/access-requests.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database activity in the Teleport audit log.

Teleport protects databases through the Teleport Database Service, which is a
Teleport agent service. For more information on agent services, read [Teleport
Agent Architecture](../architecture/agents.mdx). You can also learn how to
deploy a [pool of Teleport agents](../agents/introduction.mdx) to run multiple
agent services.

## Get started

- [Getting started](./getting-started.mdx): Connect Aurora PostgreSQL in a 10
  minute guide.

## Connect your database

Learn how to set up secure access to databases in your infrastructure.

- [Self-hosted](./enroll-self-hosted-databases.mdx) databases, regardless of
  cloud provider
- Managed [Amazon Web Services](./enroll-aws-databases.mdx) databases
- Managed [Google Cloud](./enroll-google-cloud-databases.mdx) databases
- Managed [Microsoft Azure](./enroll-azure-databases.mdx) databases
- [Database-specific cloud platforms](./enroll-managed-databases.mdx) such as
  Snowflake and MongoDB Atlas

## Manage the Teleport Database Service

The Teleport Database Service proxies connections to databases protected by
Teleport. Read more about deploying the Teleport Database Service and
enrolling databases:

- [High Availability](./guides/ha.mdx): Learn how to deploy
  multiple instances of the Teleport Database Service to proxy the same set of
  databases.
- [Dynamic Registration](./guides/dynamic-registration.mdx): Learn how to enroll
  databases without re-deploying the Teleport Database Service.

## Learn more

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for database access,
check out the [RBAC](./rbac.mdx) section.

Learn how to configure [automatic user
provisioning](./auto-user-provisioning.mdx), which removes the need for creating
individual user accounts in advance or using the same set of shared database
accounts for all users.

See [Reference](./reference.mdx) for an overview of database access-related
configuration and CLI commands.

If you hit any issues, check out the [Troubleshooting
documentation](./troubleshooting.mdx) for common problems and solutions.
