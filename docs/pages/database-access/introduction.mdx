# Database Access

Teleport can provide secure access to PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and MongoDB databases,
while improving both access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with Database Access:

- Users can retrieve short-lived database certificates using single sign-on
  flow thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [access request](../enterprise/workflow/index.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database access events as well as query activity in the audit log.

## Demo

Let's connect to a PostgreSQL server with `psql` and pgAdmin 4 after authenticating
with Github, execute a few SQL queries and observe them in the audit log:
