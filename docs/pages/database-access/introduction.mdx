description: Teleport database access introduction, demo and resources.
---

Teleport can provide secure connections to your databases while improving both
access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with database access:

- Enable users to retrieve short-lived database certificates using a Single Sign-On
  flow, thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [Access Request](../access-controls/access-requests.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database activity in the Teleport audit log.

## Demo

Let's connect to a PostgreSQL server with `psql` and pgAdmin 4 after authenticating
with GitHub, execute a few SQL queries and observe them in the audit log:

## Resources

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for database access,
check out the [RBAC](./rbac.mdx) section.

Learn how to configure [automatic user
provisioning](./auto-user-provisioning.mdx), which removes the need for creating
individual user accounts in advance or using the same set of shared database
accounts for all users.

The [Architecture](./architecture.mdx) section provides a more in-depth look at
Teleport Database Service internals such as networking and security.

See [Reference](./reference.mdx) for an overview of
database access-related configuration and CLI commands.

If you hit any issues, check out the [Troubleshooting
documentation](./troubleshooting.mdx) for common problems and solutions.
