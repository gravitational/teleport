This document describes Teleport Roles, Role Options, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Teleport Access Controls.

## Roles

A Teleport `role` works by having two lists of rules: `allow` rules and `deny` rules.
When declaring access rules, keep in mind the following:

- Everything is denied by default.
- Deny rules get evaluated first and take priority.

A rule consists of two parts: the resources and verbs. Here's an example of an
`allow` rule describing a `list` verb applied to the SSH `sessions` resource.  It means "allow
users of this role to see a list of active SSH sessions".

```yaml
allow:
  - resources: [session]
    verbs: [list]
```

If this rule was declared in the `deny` section of a role definition, it
would prohibit users from getting a list of trusted clusters and
sessions. You can see all of the available resources and verbs under the `allow`
section in the example role configuration below.

To manage cluster roles, a Teleport administrator can use the Web UI or the
command line using [tctl resource commands](../setup/reference/resources.mdx).
To see the list of roles in a Teleport cluster, an administrator can execute:

```code
$ tctl get roles
```

(!docs/pages/includes/backup-warning.mdx!)

A role definition looks like this:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  # Options used for user sessions with default values:
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 8h
    # forward_agent controls whether SSH agent forwarding is allowed
    forward_agent: true
    # port_forwarding controls whether TCP port forwarding is allowed
    port_forwarding: true
    # client_idle_timeout determines if SSH sessions to cluster nodes are forcefully
    # terminated after no activity from a client (idle client). it overrides the
    # global cluster setting. examples: "30m", "1h" or "1h30m"
    client_idle_timeout: never
    # Determines if the clients will be forcefully disconnected when their
    # certificates expire in the middle of an active SSH session.
    # It overrides the global cluster setting.
    disconnect_expired_cert: no
    # Optional: max_connections Per-user limit of concurrent sessions within a
    # cluster.
    max_connections: 2
    # Optional: max_sessions total number of session channels that can be established
    # across a single connection. 10 will match OpenSSH default behavior.
    max_sessions: 10
    # permit_x11_forwarding allows users to use X11 forwarding with openssh clients and servers through the proxy
    permit_x11_forwarding: true
    # Specify whether or not to record the user's desktop sessions.
    # Desktop session recording is enabled if one or more of the user's
    # roles has enabled recording. Defaults to true if unspecified.
    # Desktop sessions will never be recorded if auth_service.session_recording
    # is set to 'off' in teleport.yaml or if the cluster's session_recording_config
    # resource has set 'mode: off'.
    record_sessions:
      desktop: true
    # Specify whether clipboard sharing should be allowed with the
    # remote desktop (requires a supported browser). Defaults to true
    # if unspecified. If one or more of the user's roles has disabled
    # the clipboard, then it will be disabled.
    desktop_clipboard: true
    # Specify a list of names and associated values to be included in user SSH keys.
    # The key type can only be "ssh" and the mode can only be "extension".
    # The name and value fields can be arbitrary strings and the value field
    # supports variable interpolation.
    cert_extensions:
     - type: ssh
       mode: extension
       name: login@github.com
       value: "{{ external.github_login }}"
  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default, nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    # The logins array defines the OS/UNIX logins a user is allowed to use.
    # a few special variables are supported here (see below)
    logins: [root, '{{internal.logins}}']
    # Windows logins a user is allowed to use for desktop sessions.
    windows_desktop_logins: [Administrator, '{{internal.logins}}']
    # If the Kubernetes integration is enabled, this setting configures which
    # kubernetes groups the users of this role will be assigned to.
    # Note that you can refer to a SAML/OIDC trait via the "external" property bag.
    # This allows you to specify Kubernetes group membership in an identity manager:
    kubernetes_groups: ["system:masters", "{{external.trait_name}}"]]

    # List of node labels a user will be allowed to connect to:
    node_labels:
      # A user can only connect to a node marked with 'test' label:
      'environment': 'test'
      # The wildcard ('*') means "any node"
      '*': '*'
      # Labels can be specified as a list:
      'environment': ['test', 'staging']
      # Regular expressions are also supported, for example, the equivalent
      # of the list example above can be expressed as:
      'environment': '^test|staging$'

    kubernetes_labels:
      # A user can only access prod environments
      'env': 'prod'
      # User can access any region in us-west, e.g us-west-1, us-west-2
      'region': 'us-west-*'

      # identifier in logs and for organisation/categorisation.
      - name: Auditor oversight
        # Specifies an RBAC predicate that is used to define

        filter: 'contains(user.roles, "auditor")'

        # A list of session participant modes that a participant must have
        # one of in order to count against the policy.
        modes: ['moderator']
        # The minimum amount of users that need to match the filter expression
        # in order to satisfy the policy.
        count: 1

  # The deny section uses the identical format as the 'allow' section.
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny: {}
```

The following variables can be used with `logins` and `windows_desktop_logins` fields:

| Variable | Description |
| - | - |
| `{{internal.logins}}` | Substituted with "allowed logins" parameter used in `tctl users add [user] <allowed logins>` command. This applies only to users stored in Teleport's own local database. |
| `{{external.xyz}}` | Substituted with a value from an external [SSO provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on). If using SAML, this will be expanded with "xyz" assertion value. For OIDC, this will be expanded a value of "xyz" claim. |

Both variables above are there to deliver the same benefit: they allow Teleport
administrators to define allowed OS logins via the user database, be it the
local DB, or an identity manager behind a SAML or OIDC endpoint.

### An example of a SAML assertion

Assuming you have the following SAML assertion attribute in your response:

```
<Attribute Name="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname">
        <AttributeValue>firstname.lastname</AttributeValue>
</Attribute>
```

... you can use the following format in your role:

```
logins:
   - '{{external["http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"]}}'
```

### Role options

As shown above, a role can define certain restrictions on SSH sessions initiated by users.
The table below documents the behavior of each option if multiple roles are assigned to a user.

| Option | Description | Multi-role behavior |
| - | - | - |
| `max_session_ttl` | Max. time to live (TTL) of a user's SSH certificates | The shortest TTL wins |
| `forward_agent` | Allow SSH agent forwarding | Logical "OR" i.e. if any role allows agent forwarding, it's allowed |
| `port_forwarding` | Allow TCP port forwarding | Logical "OR" i.e. if any role allows port forwarding, it's allowed |
| `client_idle_timeout` | Forcefully terminate active SSH sessions after an idle interval | The shortest timeout value wins, i.e. the most restrictive value is selected |
| `disconnect_expired_cert` | Forcefully terminate active SSH sessions when a client certificate expires | Logical "OR" i.e. evaluates to "yes" if at least one role requires session termination |
| `max_connections` | Limit on how many active SSH sessions can be started via Teleport | |
| `max_sessions` | Total number of session channels which can be established across a single SSH connection via Teleport | |

## Preset roles

Teleport provides several pre-defined roles out-of-the-box:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `editor` | Allows editing of cluster configuration settings. |
| `auditor`| Allows reading cluster events, audit logs, and playing back session records. |
| `access`| Allows access to cluster resources. |

<Details title="Version Warning: Before 8.0" opened={false}>
Teleport versions prior to 8.0 also included a default `admin` role. This role
has been deprecated in favor of smaller, more fine-grained roles like the
presets mentioned above.

Users installing a brand new Teleport cluster on version 8.0 or later will not
see this `admin` role. Users who upgrade to Teleport 8 from an earlier version
*will* continue to see the admin role, but are encouraged to migrate to roles
that are more appropriately scoped.
</Details>

### Role versions

There are currently three supported role versions: `v3`, `v4` and `v5`. `v4` and `v5` roles are
completely backwards-compatible with `v3`, the only difference lies in the
default allow labels which will be applied to the role if they are not
explicitly set. Additionally, `v5` is required to use [Moderated Sessions](./guides/moderated-sessions.mdx).

Label              | `v3` Default   | `v4` and `v5` Default
------------------ | -------------- | ---------------
`node_labels`       | `[{"*": "*"}]` if the role has any logins, else `[]` | `[]`
`app_labels`        | `[{"*": "*"}]` | `[]`
`kubernetes_labels` | `[{"*": "*"}]` | `[]`
`database_labels`   | `[{"*": "*"}]` | `[]`

## RBAC for hosts

A Teleport role can also define which hosts (nodes) a user can have access to.
This works by [labeling nodes](../setup/admin/labels.mdx) and listing
allow/deny labels in a role definition.

Consider the following use case:

The infrastructure is split into staging/production environments using labels
like `environment=production` and `environment=staging`. You can create roles
that only have access to one environment. Let's say you create an intern role with the allow rule for label `environment=staging`.

### Example

The role below allows access to all nodes labeled "env=stage" except those that
also have "workload=database" or "workload=backup".

Access to any other nodes will be denied.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      'env': 'stage'

  deny:
    node_labels:
      # Multiple labels are interpreted as an "or" operation. In this case,
      # Teleport will deny access to any node labeled as 'workload=database' or
      # 'workload=backup'
      'workload': ['database', 'backup']
```

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Dynamic RBAC"
>
  Node labels can be dynamic, i.e. determined at runtime by an output of an executable. In this case, you can implement "permissions follow workload"
  policies (eg., any server where PostgreSQL is running becomes *automatically*
  accessible only by the members of the "DBA" group and nobody else).
</Admonition>

### Extended Node labels syntax

Below are a few examples for more complex filtering using various regexes.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      # literal strings:
      'environment': 'test'
      # the wildcard ('*') means "any node"
      '*': '*'
      # a list of alternative options:
      'environment': ['test', 'staging']
      # regular expressions are also supported, for example the equivalent
      # of the list example above can be expressed as:
      'environment': '^test|staging$'
```

## Teleport resources

RBAC lets teams limit what resources are available to Teleport users. This can be helpful if, for example,
you don't want regular users editing SSO (`auth_connector`) or creating and editing new roles
(`role`).

List of all rule options defined below.

```yaml
  allow:
    rules:
    # Role: CRUD options for managing Teleport Roles
    - resources:
      - role
      verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
    # Auth Connectors: CRUD options for managing SSO connectors
    - resources:
      - auth_connector
      verbs:  [list, create, read, update, delete]
    # Session: Provides access to Session Recordings.
    # e.g If session read is false, users can't play the recordings
    # It is possible to restrict "list" but to allow "read" (in this case a user will
    # be able to replay a session using `tsh play` if they know the session ID)
    - resources:
      - session
      verbs:  [list,read]
    # Trusted Clusters:  CRUD options for managing Trusted Clusters
    - resources:
      - trusted_cluster
      verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
    # Events: Can view the audit log and session recordings.
    - resources:
      - event
      verbs:  [list, read]
    # User: CRUD options for managing Teleport local users
    - resources: [user]
      verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
    # Tokens: CRUD options for managing tokens
    # Enterprise customer can enable app and node wizard enabling this resource
    - resources: [token]
      verbs: [list,create,read,update,delete]
```

## RBAC for sessions

It is possible to further limit access to
[shared sessions](../server-access/guides/tsh.mdx#sharing-sessions) and
[session recordings](../architecture/nodes.mdx#session-recording).
The examples below illustrate how to restrict session access only for the user
who created the session.

<Details title="Version Warning: Before 8.1" opened={false}>
Teleport versions prior to 8.1 don't support the roles shown below.
You may create these roles after upgrading, but in the event of a cluster
downgrade they will become invalid.
</Details>

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Preset Auditor Role"
>
In order for these roles to take effect, you must ensure your user doesn't also
have a more permissive role, like the preset `auditor` role, which allows access
to all events, sessions, and session recordings.
</Admonition>

Role for restricted access to session recordings:

```yaml
version: v5
kind: role
metadata:
  name: only-own-sessions
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    # Users can only view session recordings for sessions in which they
    # participated.
    - resources: [session]
      verbs: [list, read]
      where: contains(session.participants, user.metadata.name)
```

Role for restricted access to active sessions:

```yaml
version: v5
kind: role
metadata:
  name: only-own-ssh-sessions
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    # Teleport allows shared session access by default, so for our restrictions
    # to work we first allow access to ssh_sessions...
    - resources: [ssh_session]
      verbs: ['*']
  deny:
    rules:
    # ... and then limit that access via a deny rule.
    # Deny rules take precedence over allow rules, so the resulting role allows
    # users to create SSH sessions but to only view their own sessions.
    - resources: [ssh_session]
      verbs: [list, read, update, delete]
      where: '!contains(ssh_session.participants, user.metadata.name)'
```

## Second Factor - U2F

Refer to the [Second Factor - U2F guide](./guides/u2f.mdx) if you have a cluster
using the legacy U2F support.

## Filter fields

Here is an explanation of the fields used in the `where` and `filter` conditions within this guide.

| Field                      | Description                                         |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `user.roles`               | The list of roles assigned to a user              |
| `session.participants`     | The list of participants from a session recording |
| `ssh_session.participants` | The list of participants from an SSH session       |
| `user.metadata.name`       | The user's name                                     |

Check out our [predicate language](../setup/reference/predicate-language.mdx#scoping-allowdeny-rules-in-role-resources) 
guide for a more in depth explanation of the language.
