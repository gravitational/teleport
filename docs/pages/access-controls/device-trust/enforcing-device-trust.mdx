<Admonition type="notice" title="Supported Resources">
Device trust fully supports SSH, Database and Kubernetes resources.

Apps may enforce trusted devices using role-based enforcement. See the [App
Access support](#app-access-support) section.

Support for other resources is planned for upcoming Teleport versions.
</Admonition>

Resources protected by the device mode "required" will enforce the use of a
trusted device, in addition to establishing the user's identity and enforcing
the necessary roles. Furthermore, users using a trusted device leave audit
trails that include the device's information.

Device Trust enforcement can be configured with the following three modes of operation, represented
by the `device_trust_mode` authentication setting:

- `off` - disables device trust. Device authentication is not performed and
  device-aware audit logs are absent.
- `optional` - enables device authentication and device-aware audit, but does
  not require a trusted device to access resources.
- `required` - enables device authentication and device-aware audit.
  Additionally, it requires a trusted device for all SSH, Database and
  Kubernetes connections.

(!docs/pages/includes/device-trust/prereqs.mdx!)

## Role-based trusted device enforcement

Role-based configuration enforces trusted device access at the role level. It
can be configured with the `spec.options.device_trust_mode` option and
applies to the resources in its `allow` rules. It
works similarly to [`require_session_mfa`](../guides/per-session-mfa.mdx).

<Admonition type="tip" title="v13.3.6+">
  Teleport version 13.3.6 and above has the preset `require-trusted-device` role.
  Make sure you update the "allow" rules in the role according to your requirements.
</Admonition>

To enforce authenticated device checks for a specific role, update the role with
the following:

```diff
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: require-trusted-device
spec:
  options:
    # require authenticated device check for this role
+   device_trust_mode: "required" # add this line
  allow:
    logins: ['admin']
    kubernetes_groups: ['edit']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    ...

```

```code
$ tctl create -f device-enforcement.yaml
```

## Cluster-wide trusted device enforcement

Cluster-wide configuration enforces trusted device access at the cluster level.
Enterprise clusters run in `optional` mode by default. Changing the mode to
`required` will enforce a trusted device for all SSH, Database and Kubernetes
accesses.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Web UI">
The Web UI is not capable of trusted device access. Only `tsh` and Teleport
Connect are able to fulfill device mode `required`.
</Admonition>

To enable device mode `required` update your configuration as follows:

<Tabs dropDownCaption="Teleport Deployment">
<TabItem label="Dynamic Resources" options="Self-Hosted,Teleport Enterprise Cloud" >
Create a `cap.yaml` file or get the existing configuration using
`tctl get cluster_auth_preference`:

```diff
kind: cluster_auth_preference
version: v2
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  type: local
  second_factor: "on"
  webauthn:
    rp_id: (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=)
  device_trust:
+   mode: "required" # add this line
```

Update the configuration:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
cluster auth preference has been updated
```

You can also edit this configuration directly:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_auth_preference
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Static Config" options="Self-Hosted">
Edit the Auth Server's `teleport.yaml` file and restart all Auth Services:

```diff
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: local
    second_factor: "on"
    webauthn:
      rp_id: (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=)
    device_trust:
+     mode: "required" # add this line
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the config is updated, SSH, Database and Kubernetes access without a trusted device will be forbidden.
For example, SSH access without a trusted device fails with the following error:

```code
$ tsh ssh (=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
ERROR: ssh: rejected: administratively prohibited (unauthorized device)
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Trusted Clusters">
It is possible to use [trusted
clusters](../../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) to limit the impact of
device mode `required`. A leaf cluster in mode `required` will enforce access to
all of its resources, without imposing the same restrictions to the root
cluster. Likewise, a root cluster will not enforce device trust on resources in
leaf clusters.
</Admonition>

## App Access support

Apps may enforce device trust via [role-based enforcement](
#role-based-trusted-device-enforcement). Any apps that enforce device trust must
be accessed using tsh commands such as [tsh proxy app](
../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-proxy-app) or using the certificates issued by
`tsh app login`. Direct access to those apps via the Web UI is not yet
available.

For example, to enforce device trust for all `env:production` apps, save the
role below as `require-trusted-device-apps.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: require-trusted-device-apps
spec:
  options:
    device_trust_mode: "required"
  allow:
    app_labels:
      env: production
```

Create the role and assign it to a user:

```code
$ tctl create require-trusted-device-apps.yaml
$ tctl edit users/alice
```

```diff
kind: user
metadata:
  name: alice
  # (...)
spec:
  roles:
  - access
  - editor
+ - require-trusted-device-apps
  # (...)
version: v2
```

Now the alice user can only access `env:production` apps using a trusted device.
For example, to access an app called `myapp`, alice runs `tsh proxy app myapp -p
8888` and opens http://localhost:8888 in her browser.

## Locking a device

Similar to [session and identity locking](../guides/locking.mdx), a device can
be locked using `tctl lock`.

Locking blocks certificate issuance and ongoing or future accesses originating
from a locked device. Locking a device only works if device trust is enabled and
if the device is enrolled to Teleport.

Find a device ID to lock:

```code
$ tctl devices ls
Asset Tag     OS    Enroll Status   Device ID
------------ -----  ------------- ------------------------------------
(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)  macOS  enrolled     (=devicetrust.device_id=)
```

Lock a device:

```code
$ tctl lock --device=(=devicetrust.device_id=) --ttl=12h
Created a lock with name "5444970a-39a0-4814-968d-e58b4a8fa686".
```

Now, if a user on that device tries to access an SSH server for example,
Teleport will deny access:

```code
$ tsh ssh (=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
ERROR: ssh: rejected: administratively prohibited (lock targeting Device:"(=devicetrust.device_id=)" is in force)
```
