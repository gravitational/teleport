# Role Templates

As organizations grow, infrastructure teams have to figure out
how to define access control policies that don't require manual configuration
every time people join, leave and form new teams.

Here are some common examples of such policies:

- Grant every single sign-on user an SSH login generated from their email.
- Assign each team member to their team's Kubernetes group.
- Limit dev team to read-only replica of a database.

Let's explore how Teleport's role templates provide a way to describe these and other policies.

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Teleport](../getting-started.mdx) or [Teleport Cloud](../../cloud/introduction.mdx) >= (=teleport.version=)
- [Tctl admin tool](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) >= (=teleport.version=)

<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
  The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. However, we generally discourage the use of `sudo` in customer-facing production environments per the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP). 
</Admonition>

Verify that your Teleport client is connected:

```bash
sudo tctl status

# Cluster  acme.example.com
# Version  6.0.2
# Host CA  never updated
# User CA  never updated
# Jwt CA   never updated
# CA pin   sha256:e63c7c44be468d37a5b0276b70e9d10b17f24f4be19d6b579810fc94eaa31783
```

## Local ysers

Imagine you have two users, Alice and Bob. We would like to set the following
access policies:

- Alice to login as SSH user `admin` and Kubernetes group `edit`
- Bob to login as `ubuntu` and Kubernetes group `view`

We can create two roles, one for each user in file `roles.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['admin']
    kubernetes_groups: ['edit']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
---
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: bob
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['ubuntu']
    kubernetes_groups: ['view']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

You can create roles and invite Alice and Bob as local users:

```bash
sudo tctl create -f roles.yaml
sudo tctl users add alice --roles=alice
sudo tctl users add bob --roles=bob
```

Having one role per user is not going to scale well. Because the roles
are so similar, we can assign variables to each user, and use just one role template
for both Alice and Bob.

Let's create a role template `devs.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: devs
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['{{internal.logins}}']
    kubernetes_groups: ['{{internal.kubernetes_groups}}']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Any role becomes a template once it starts using template variables.
Just like roles, role templates are a valid YAML and validate both the structure and types.

Role template `devs` is using `internal` notation referring to local user's
traits `logins` and `kubernetes_groups`.

Use `tctl` to create a role template:

```bash
sudo tctl create -f ~/scripts/access-controls/devs.yaml
```

The last step is to update Alice's and Bob's users with traits. Here is an example
of user resources in a file `traits.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  roles: ['devs']
  traits:
    logins: ['admin']
    kubernetes_groups: ['edit']
---
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: bob
spec:
  roles: ['devs']
  traits:
    logins: ['ubuntu']
    kubernetes_groups: ['view']
```

Update both user's entries with `tctl create -f` command:

```bash
sudo tctl create -f traits.yaml 
# user "alice" has been updated
```

Once Alice logs in, she will receive SSH and X.509 certificates with
a new role and SSH logins and Kubernetes groups set:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com:443 --user=alice

# > Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
#   Logged in as:       alice
#   Cluster:            teleport.example.com
#   Roles:              devs*
#   Logins:             admin
#   Kubernetes:         enabled
#   Kubernetes groups:  edit
#   Valid until:        2021-03-26 07:13:57 -0700 PDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
#   Extensions:         permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

## SSO users

Identity provider admins can assign metadata to a user, such as
group membership or access permissions. Administrators configure what metadata
is shared with Teleport. Teleport receives user metadata keys and values as OIDC claims or SAML
attributes during [single sign-on redirect flow](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-oidc-authentication-works/):

```yaml
# Alice has an email alice@example.com. Email is a standard OIDC claim.
email: "alice@example.com"
# Alice is a member of groups admins and devs
groups: ["admins", "devs"]
# She can access prod and staging environments
access: {"env": ["prod", "staging"]}
```

Let's create role template `sso-users` that expects external attribute `logins`
to be set by identity provider. Save this role as `sso-users.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: sso-users
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['{{external.logins}}']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

A GitHub connector `github.yaml` maps every `cyber` team's member of organization `octocats` to
the role `sso-logins`:

```yaml
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  name: github
spec:
  # Client ID of Github OAuth app
  client_id: client-id
  # Client secret of Github OAuth app
  client_secret: secret-data-here
  # cCnnector display name that will be shown on web UI login screen
  display: Github
  # Callback URL that will be called after successful authentication
  redirect_url: https://teleport.example.com/v1/webapi/github/callback
  # Mapping of org/team memberships onto allowed logins and roles
  teams_to_logins:
    - organization: octocats # Github organization name
      team: cyber # Github team name within that organization
      # Role names to map to
      logins:
        - sso-users
```

Create this connector using `tctl`:

```bash
sudo tctl create -f github.yaml
```

Once Bob logs in using SSO, he will receive SSH and X.509 certificates with
a new role and SSH logins generated using `sso-users` role template:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com:443 --auth=github

# > Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com:443
#   Logged in as:       bob
#   Cluster:            teleport.example.com
#   Roles:              sso-users*
#   Logins:             bob
#   Kubernetes:         enabled
#   Kubernetes groups:  edit
#   Valid until:        2021-03-26 07:13:57 -0700 PDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
#   Extensions:         permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

## Interpolation rules

Administrators can configure what attributes identity providers return
during single-sign on and present to Teleport. Let's review a couple of scenarios
and see how Teleport interpolates the variables.

Let's go back to the the list of attributes for Alice's user entry:

```yaml
# Alice has an email alice@example.com. Email is a standard OIDC claim.
email: "alice@example.com"
# Alice is a member of groups admins and devs
groups: ["admins", "devs"]
# She can access prod and staging environments
access: {"env": ["prod", "staging"]}
```

Let's see how these variables are used with role template `interpolation`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: interpolation
spec:
  allow:
    # Role template fields can mix hard-coded values and variables.
    logins: ['{{external.logins}}', 'admin']

    # Roles support interpolation in string values.
    kubernetes_users: ['IAM#{{external.foo}};']

    # Lists get expanded into lists.
    kubernetes_groups: ['{{external.groups}}']

    # Functions transform variables.
    database_users: ['{{email.local(external.email)}}']
    
    # Labels can mix template and hard-coded values
    node_labels:
      'env': '{{external.access["env"]}}'
      'region': 'us-west-2'

    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

After interpolation with Alice's SSO user attributes, the role template will
behave as the following role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: interpolation
spec:
  allow:
    # The variable external.logins is not sent by provider and it renders empty,
    # leaving only hard-coded admin value
    logins: ['admin']

    # The variable external.email is expanded in a string.
    kubernetes_users: ['IAM#alice@example.com;']

    # The variable external.groups gets replaced with a list.
    kubernetes_groups: ['devs', 'admins']

    # The variable email.local will take a local part of the external.email attribute.
    database_users: ['alice']

    # Node labels have 'env' replaced from a variable
    node_labels:
      'env': ['prod', 'staging']
      'region': 'us-west-2'

    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
```
