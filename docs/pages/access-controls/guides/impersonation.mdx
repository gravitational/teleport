title: Impersonating Teleport Users
description: How to issue short-lived certs on behalf of Teleport users using impersonation.
---

Sometimes users need to create short-lived certificates for non-interactive
users, for example, CI/CD systems. Your programs interacting with Teleport may
need to create their own authentication as well. Teleport's impersonation allows
users and robots to create short-lived certs for other users and roles.

Let's explore how interactive user Alice can create credentials for a
non-interactive CI/CD user Jenkins and a security scanner.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3: Create a CI/CD user and corresponding role

First, we will create a role called `jenkins`. Notice the `max_session_ttl`
parameter, which limits the cert duration for certificates issued to users with
this role. As a rule of thumb, the shorter the TTL, the better.

We will also create a user also named `jenkins` and assign the role to the user.

Save this file as `jenkins.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  # SSH options used for user sessions
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 240h

  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default, nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    logins: ['jenkins']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
---
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: jenkins
spec:
  roles: ['jenkins']
```

Create the resources:

```code
$ tctl create -f jenkins.yaml
```

## Step 2/3: Create an impersonator role

Next, we will create a role called `impersonator`. Users with this role will be permitted to
impersonate the `jenkins` user and role.

Save this role definition as `impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: impersonator
spec:
  # SSH options used for user sessions
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. by default nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ['jenkins']
      roles: ['jenkins']

  # The deny section uses the identical format as the 'allow' section.
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Create the `role` resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f impersonator.yaml
```

Next, create an interactive user named `alice` and assign the impersonator role so
that `alice` can impersonate `jenkins`.

We also assign the preset `access` role that allows users to access clusters for
Alice's convenience.
</Admonition>

```code
$ tctl users add alice  --roles=impersonator,access
```

## Step 3/3: Use impersonation to issue a certificate

Alice can log in using `tsh` and issue a cert for `jenkins`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --user=alice --auth=local
$ tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=openssh --out=jenkins --ttl=240h
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=alice --auth=local
$ tctl auth sign --user=jenkins --format=openssh --out=jenkins --ttl=240h
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Here is an example of how Alice can use the keys:

```code
# Start a fresh SSH agent for this session
$ eval $(ssh-agent)
# Adds cert to the agent
$ ssh-add jenkins
# ssh into the node as jenkins
$ ssh -J jenkins@teleport.localhost:3023 -p 3022 jenkins@127.0.0.1
```

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Audit"
>
  Teleport's `session.start` event will capture an action done
  by `alice` who is impersonating `jenkins`.
  ```
  session.start event:session.start impersonator:alice login:jenkins user:jenkins
  ```
  The SSH certificate issued for `jenkins` contains information
  about impersonator - `alice`.
</Admonition>

## Advanced

### Impersonation Rules

To prevent unintended consequences, Teleport defines the following impersonation rules:

- Even though Alice's `max_session_ttl` is 10 hours, she can issue a cert with a
  longer TTL of 240 hours, because the `jenkins` role allows it. A certificate's
  TTL issued using impersonation is extended to the maximum TTL of the roles
  being impersonated.
- Even if the `jenkins` role could impersonate some other roles, Alice would not
  be able to use this permission. Teleport prevents recursive impersonation.
- Alice can get a new `jenkins` certificate with the same TTL, but with the
  metadata updated, for example, to point to a different Teleport leaf cluster.
  Teleport allows impersonated users to renew their certificates with the
  reduced scope of the certificate.

### Dynamic Impersonation

Sometimes you don't know in advance what roles will be created by the system.

You can use the `where` condition to allow one role to impersonate other roles
based on matching labels.

For example, suppose you wanted to define a `security-impersonator` role that
allowed the impersonation of any users or roles with the label
`group: security`. This could be accomplished with the following role definition:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: security-impersonator
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  # security-impersonator can impersonate any user or role with the 'group: security' label
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ['*']
      roles: ['*']
      where: >
        equals(impersonate_role.metadata.labels["group"], "security") && 
        equals(impersonate_user.metadata.labels["group"], "security")

  # The deny section uses the identical format as the 'allow' section.
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Create the resources:

```code
$ tctl create -f security-impersonator.yaml
$ tctl users update alice --set-roles=security-impersonator,access
```

Alice can now impersonate any role and user with a label `group: security`.

Now suppose we need to create another machine user for a security scanning tool.
Create a user and a role `security-scanner` using the following template:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: security-scanner
  labels:
    group: security
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  allow:
    logins: ['root']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
---
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: security-scanner
  labels:
    group: security
spec:
  roles: ['security-scanner']
```

Even though this role was created after Alice's user was configured, Alice can
issue certificates for the `security-scanner` user because it is labeled with
the `group: security` label.

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user=security-scanner --format=openssh --out=security-scanner --ttl=10h
```

### Matching user traits

We can also define impersonation rules by matching against user traits.

Here we updated the `security-impersonator` role to allow for the impersonation
of any other users or roles where the `group` user trait contains the same value
as the label on the role and/or user to impersonate:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: security-impersonator
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ['*']
      roles: ['*']
      where: >
        contains(user.spec.traits["group"], impersonate_role.metadata.labels["group"]) && 
        contains(user.spec.traits["group"], impersonate_user.metadata.labels["group"])

  # The deny section uses the identical format as the 'allow' section.
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

While user traits typically come from an external identity provider, we can test
with local user `alice` by manually updating Alice's account with traits.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  traits:
    group: ['security', 'devops']
  roles:
  - security-impersonator
  - access
```

Since Alice's `group` trait contains `security`, and the `security-scanner` user
has a label of `group: security`, Alice will be able to impersonate the security
scanner.

Alice will need to log in again to receive the newly updated traits:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

```code
# Once Alice logs in again, she will receive a new certificate with updated roles.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=alice --auth=local
# Alice can now get a certificate for the security scanner
$ tctl auth sign --user=security-scanner --format=openssh --out=security-scanner --ttl=10h
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```code
# Once Alice logs in again, she will receive a new certificate with updated roles.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=alice --auth=local
# Alice can now get a certificate for the security scanner
$ tctl auth sign --user=security-scanner --format=openssh --out=security-scanner --ttl=10h
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

| `impersonate_role.metadata.labels["<label key>"]` | The label value given the label `key` from a role to impersonate                                                       |
| `impersonate_user.metadata.labels["<label key>"]` | The label value given the label `key` from a user to impersonate                                                       |
