# Short-lived certificates

We'll review configuring and managing short-lived certificates for programmatic API access below.

## Create short-lived certificates

Teleport Server Access provides the ability to manage short-lived certificates and give users API and resource access for specified durations of time:

1. Users can define a role to programmatically interact with the Teleport API per the [Teleport API Getting Started](../reference/api/introduction.mdx).

   - This is designed to be convenient for mass deployments or operations that must be repeated (daily jobs, frequent operations, etc.).

2. Admins also create short-lived certificates for resources users must connect to directly:

   - Execute: `tctl auth sign --ttl=1h --user=jenkins --out=jenkins.pem` to generate a certificate valid for a specified *Time To Live* (TTL).
   - Team members can access private resources securely using certificates and SSH tunnels.
   - No sharing of resource secrets, passwords, or credentials only certificates that are unique to that user and specified length of time.

## Use scenarios for tctl admins

Describe use scenarios for short-lived certificates and `tctl auth` roles.
