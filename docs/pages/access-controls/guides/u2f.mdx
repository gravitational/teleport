title: Second Factor - U2F
description: Configuring U2F support in Teleport clusters

# U2F

Teleport supports [FIDO U2F](https://www.yubico.com/about/background/fido/)
hardware keys as a second authentication factor. U2F can be used for logging
into Teleport (`tsh login` or the login page on the Web UI) and for logging
into individual SSH nodes or Kubernetes clusters (`tsh ssh` and `kubectl`).

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Teleport](../getting-started.mdx) or [Teleport Cloud](../../cloud/introduction.mdx) >= (=teleport.version=)
- U2F hardware device, such as Yubikey or Solokey
- Web browser that [supports U2F](https://caniuse.com/u2f)

## Enable U2F support

By default U2F is disabled. To enable U2F support, edit the Teleport
configuration file `/etc/teleport.yaml` like so:

```yaml
# snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml to show an example configuration of U2F:
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: local
    # to enable U2F support, set this field to 'u2f', 'on' or 'optional'
    second_factor: u2f
    u2f:
       app_id: https://example.com:443
       facets:
       - https://example.com:443
       - https://example.com
       - example.com:443
       - example.com
       device_attestation_cas:
       - "/path/to/u2f_attestation_ca.pem"
```

The fields in the above snippet are:

- `app_id` - public address of the Teleport proxy, *including* the `https://`
  prefix and port number.

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  The `app_id` must never change in the lifetime of the cluster, because it's
  recorded in the registration data on the U2F device. If the App ID changes,
  all existing U2F key registrations will become invalid and all users who use
  U2F as the second factor will need to re-register. When using multiple proxy
  servers, make sure they are reachable at the same public address (usually
  behind a load balancer).
</Admonition>

- `facets` - list of allowed addresses of the Teleport proxy, checked during
  authentication attempts. This list is used to prevent malicious websites and
  proxies from requesting U2F challenges on behalf of the legitimate proxy.

  For compatibility with multiple browsers, it's recommended to write down the
  proxy address in several formats. For example, if your `app_id` is
  `https://example.com:443`, your `facets` should include
  `https://example.com:443`, `https://example.com` and `example.com:443`.

- `device_attestation_cas` - optional list of certificate authorities (as local
  file paths or in-line PEM certificate string) for U2F [device
  attestation](https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-u2f-v1.0-nfc-bt-amendment-20150514/fido-u2f-overview.html#verifying-that-a-u2f-device-is-genuine)
  verification. This field allows you to restrict which U2F device vendors you
  trust. Devices from other vendors will be rejected during registration. By
  default, any vendor is allowed.

Once the configuration file was edited, restart `teleport` to pick up the
changes.

## Register U2F devices as a user

A user can register multiple U2F devices [using `tsh`](../../cli-docs.mdx#tsh-mfa-add):

```bash
tsh mfa add

# Choose device type [TOTP, U2F]: u2f
# Enter device name: desktop yubikey
# Tap any *registered* security key
# Tap your *new* security key
# MFA device "desktop yubikey" added.
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Windows support">
  U2F devices are currently not supported in `tsh` on Windows.
</Admonition>

## Login using U2F

Once a U2F device is registered, the user will be prompted for it on login:

```sh
tsh login --proxy=example.com

# Enter password for Teleport user awly:
# Tap any security key <tap U2F token>
# > Profile URL:        https://example.com
#   Logged in as:       awly
#   Cluster:            example.com
#   Roles:              admin*
#   Logins:             awly
#   Kubernetes:         enabled
#   Valid until:        2021-04-01 23:32:29 -0700 PDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
#   Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

<Admonition type="note">
U2F for logging into Teleport is only required for [local
users](../../admin-guide.mdx#local-connector). SSO users should configure
multi-factor authentication in their SSO provider.
