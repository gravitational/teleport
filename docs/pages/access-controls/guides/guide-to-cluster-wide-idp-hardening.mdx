Protecting your organization against Identity Provider (IdP) compromises is more critical than ever. 
This guide aims to help you fortify your identity infrastructure and mitigate the risks associated with IdP weaknesses.

## Understanding IdP Compromise

An IdP compromise occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to your identity management 
system, potentially allowing them to impersonate legitimate users, escalate privileges, or access 
sensitive information. This can happen through various means, such as exploiting software vulnerabilities, 
stealing credentials, or social engineering attacks.

### Why Your Current Security Measures May Fall Short

While many organizations have implemented basic security measures like single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA), 
these alone may not be sufficient to protect against sophisticated attacks targeting your IdP. 
Attackers are constantly evolving their techniques, and traditional security measures may have limitations 
or vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

## Hardening Measures

To significantly enhance your defense against IdP compromises, we recommend implementing the following comprehensive security measures:

   a. Set up cluster-wide WebAuthn: Implement strong, phishing-resistant authentication across 
   your entire infrastructure using WebAuthn standards. WebAuthn, a W3C standard and part of FIDO2, 
   enables public-key cryptography for web authentication. Teleport supports WebAuthn as a second factor 
   for logging into Teleport (via tsh login or Web UI) and accessing SSH nodes or Kubernetes clusters. 
   It's compatible with hardware keys (e.g., YubiKeys, SoloKeys) and biometric authenticators like Touch ID and Windows Hello.

   b. Establish cluster-wide per-session MFA: Ensure that multi-factor authentication is required 
   for each session, not just at initial login, to maintain continuous security. Teleport's per-session 
   MFA enhances security by protecting against compromised on-disk certificates. It requires additional 
   MFA checks when initiating new SSH, Kubernetes, database, or desktop sessions.

   c. Implement cluster-wide device trust: Develop a system to verify and manage trusted devices 
   across your organization, reducing the risk of unauthorized access from unknown or compromised 
   devices. Device trust adds an extra layer of security by requiring the use of trusted devices 
   for accessing protected resources, complementing user identity and role enforcement. This can be 
   configured cluster-wide or via RBAC. Supported resources include apps (role-based only), SSH nodes, 
   databases, Kubernetes clusters, and first MFA device enrollment. 
   The latter helps prevent auto-provisioning of new users through compromised IdPs.

   d. Enable MFA for admin actions: Add an extra layer of security for sensitive administrative operations 
   by requiring multi-factor authentication for these high-privilege actions. Teleport enforces additional MFA verification 
   for administrative actions across all clients (tctl, tsh, Web UI, and Connect). This feature adds an extra 
   security layer by re-verifying user identity immediately before any admin action, mitigating risks from compromised admin accounts.

By adopting these advanced security measures, you can create a robust defense against IdP compromises and significantly reduce your organization's attack surface. 
In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each of these recommendations, providing step-by-step guidance on implementation and best practices.

## Cluster-Wide WebAuthn

By leveraging WebAuthn, Teleport enhances its security posture through strong, phishing-resistant 
multi-factor authentication (MFA). Unlike traditional password-based methods, WebAuthn uses 
cryptographic keys that are stored on a secure hardware device or built-in platform authenticator, 
such as a fingerprint reader. 

With WebAuthn, users can authenticate using their hardware security keys, such as 
YubiKeys, SoloKeys, or biometric authenticators like Touch ID and Windows Hello (`tsh` and WebUI), 
making the login process both faster and more user-friendly, encouraging broader adoption 
and consistent MFA use among employees.
