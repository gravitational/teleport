This guide examines how to configure Teleport for use with Slack.

Slack integration allows you to treat Teleport access and permission requests within Slack messages as well as through the command line.

<Admonition type="Note" title="Access Requests">
  Access Requests are now supported in both the Teleport Open Source and Enterprise Editions.
</Admonition>

#### Example Slack request

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have:

- Teleport (=teleport.version=).
- Admin privileges with access to [`tctl`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl).
- Slack Admin Privileges to create an app and install it to your workspace.

<Admonition type="Tip" title="tip">
  Read [Getting Started](../../getting-started.mdx) to install Teleport and configure it with a user and role.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/4. Create a user and role for access

1. Log into your Teleport Authentication Node. The Authentication Node is where you'll most likely perform administrative tasks and run the powerful `tctl` ("tea-kettle") admin tool. 

2. Create a new user and role with only API access to the `access_request` API. 
  
   The following YAML file specifies a non-interactive bot `access-plugin` user and role.

   ```yaml
   kind: user
   metadata:
     name: access-plugin
   spec:
     roles: ['access-plugin']
   version: v2
   ---
   kind: role
   version: v3
   metadata:
     name: access-plugin
   spec:
     allow:
       rules:
         - resources: ['access_request']
           verbs: ['list', 'read']
         - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
           verbs: ['update']
       # Teleport currently refuses to issue certs for a user with 0 logins.
       # This restriction may be lifted in future versions.
       logins: ['access-plugin-not-used']
   ```
    
   Name the YAML file something like `access.yaml`.
  
   Ensure that the role and name is `access-plugin`; the plugin requires this to function properly.

   <Admonition type="warning" title="Warning">
    The examples below may include the use of the `sudo` keyword to make following each step easier when creating resources from scratch. However, we generally discourage the use of `sudo` in customer-facing production environments per the *Principle of Least Privilege* (POLP). 
   </Admonition>

3. Create the bot for Teleport using the created role:
  
   ```bash
   sudo tctl create -f access.yaml
   ```

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you're using other plugins, you'll likely want to create users and roles for each plugin. It's generally good practice to separate users and roles by concern.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/4. Export access-plugin certificate

Teleport Plugin uses the `access-plugin` role and user to perform the approval. 

We export the identity files, using [`tctl auth sign`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl-auth-sign).

```bash
sudo tctl auth --auth-server=auth.example.com:3025 sign --format=tls --user=access-plugin --out=auth --ttl=1h
# ...
```

The above sequence should result in three generated certificate files: `auth.crt`, `auth.key`, and `auth.cas` (the certificate, private key, and CA certs respectively).  We'll reference these files later when [configuring the plugins](#configuring-teleport-slack).

<Admonition type="note" title="Certificate Lifetime">
  By default, [`tctl auth sign`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl-auth-sign) produces certificates with a relatively short lifetime. For production deployments, the `--ttl` flag can be used to ensure a more practical certificate lifetime. `--ttl=2090h` exports a 1-year token.
</Admonition>

### Create Slack app

We'll create a new Slack app and set up auth tokens and callback URLs so that Slack knows how to notify the Teleport plugin when the "Approve / Deny" buttons are clicked.

You'll need to:

1. Create a new app, pick a name, and select a workspace it belongs to.
2. Add OAuth scopes. This is required by Slack for the app to be installed — we'll only need a single scope to post messages to your Slack account.
3. Obtain an OAuth token.

#### Creating a new Slack app

1. Visit [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) to create a new Slack App.

2. Use the following configuration settings:

   **App Name:** Teleport<br/>
   **Development Slack Workspace:** Pick the workspace you'd like the requests to show up in. <br/>
   **App Icon:** <a href="../../../img/enterprise/plugins/teleport_bot@2x.png" download>Download Teleport Bot Icon</a>

![Create Slack App](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/Create-a-Slack-App.png)

#### Selecting OAuth scopes

Within the app screen, go to “OAuth and Permissions” under "Features" in the sidebar menu. 

Then scroll to "Scopes", and add the following scopes so the plugin can post messages to your Slack channels:

- `chat:write`
- `incoming-webhook` 
- `users:read` 
- `users:read.email` 

![API Scopes](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/api-scopes.png)

#### Obtain an OAuth token

Slack will generate an OAuth token for you automatically. Find it at the top under the "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace" section:

![OAuth Tokens](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/OAuth.png)

#### Add the app to your Slack Workspace

Add the app to your Slack Workspace:

![OAuth Tokens](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/Slackbot-Permissions.png)

After doing so, make sure to invite your bot to the channel. Do this by using the `@` command.

## Step 3/4. Installing the Teleport Slack Plugin

Since Teleport plugins typically augment your Teleport cluster with third-party extensions and integrations with minimal additional overhead, you'll want to consider your overall architecture. We recommend installing the Teleport Slack plugin alongside Teleport Proxy.

We currently only provide `linux-amd64` binaries. You can optionally compile these plugins from [source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/tree/master/access/slack).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Download">
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-slack-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    tar -xzf teleport-access-slack-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    cd teleport-access-slack
    ./install
    ```

    ```bash
    # Output
    Teleport Slack binaries have been copied to /usr/local/bin
    You can run teleport-slack configure > /etc/teleport-slack.toml to bootstrap your config file
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="From Source">
    To install from source you need `git` and `go >= (=teleport.golang=)` installed.

    ```bash
    # Checkout teleport-plugins
    git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
    cd teleport-plugins/access/slack
    make
    ```

### Configuring Teleport Slack

Teleport Slack uses a config file in `TOML` format.

Generate a boilerplate config by running the following command:

```bash
teleport-slack configure > teleport-slack.toml
```

#### Copy certificates

Navigate back to the certificates you generated with `tctl auth sign` before. The plugin installer creates a folder for them at: `/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/`. 

Copy or move the certificates there and point the config file to them:

```bash
# Navigate up directories
cd ../
# Move certificate files created by 'tctl auth sign'
sudo mv -f auth.cas /var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/
sudo mv -f auth.crt /var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/
sudo mv -f auth.key /var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/
```

#### Editing the config file

Run the following command to modify the configuration file before we deploy it:

```bash
sudo nano teleport-access-slack/teleport-slack.toml
```

Teleport YAML configuration files are divided into sections:

```conf
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-slack.toml!)
```

1. Find the "Teleport" section and add the certificates you generated with `tctl auth sign` before.
2. Find the "Slack" section and add the OAuth token, signing token, and the desired channel name.
3. Add the desired recipients. 

  For users, add the email address associated with their Slack profile. 
  
  For channels, add the Slack Channel ID (which can be found in the URL path; `YYYYYYY` below).

  ![Find Slack Channel ID](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/slack-channel-id.png)

4. Copy `teleport-slack.toml` to the location used by the Slack Plugin:

   ```bash
   sudo mv teleport-access-slack/teleport-slack.toml /etc/teleport-slack.toml
   ```

## Step 4/4. Test run

Assuming that Teleport is running, and you've created the Slack app, the plugin config, and provided all the certificates — you can now run the plugin and test the workflow!

```bash
sudo teleport-slack start
```

If everything works fine, the log output should look like this:

```bash
sudo teleport-slack start
# INFO   Starting Teleport Access Slack Plugin (=teleport.plugin.version=): slack/app.go:72
```

### Create a test user

Many of Teleport's default user roles lack the ability to make role requests.

Create a test role called `dev` with that ability:

```yaml
kind: "role"
version: "v3"
metadata:
  name: "dev"
  namespace: "default"
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles: ['*']
```

Assign it to a new `test-user`:

```bash
tctl request create test-user --roles=dev
```

### Testing the approval workflow

You can create a test permissions request with `tctl` and check if the plugin works as expected like this:

#### Create a test permissions request on behalf of a user

```bash
tctl request create test-user --roles=dev
```

A user can also try using `--request-roles` flag.

```bash
# Example with a user trying to request a role DBA.
tsh login --request-roles=dev
```

The Slack Plugin will display:

```bash
INFO   Successfully posted to Slack request_id:37dFhe-7780-4cff-a1ce-345c0318776f request_op:put slack_channel:AIFODUF21 slack_timestamp:1622651379.000200 slack/app.go:221
````

#### Approve or deny the request on Slack

The messages should automatically update to reflect approvals and denials. 

You can also check the request status with `tctl`:

```bash
tctl request ls
```

### tsh user login and request admin role

You can also test the full workflow from the user's perspective using `tsh`:

```bash
tsh login --request-roles=dev
# Seeking request approval... (id: ceffe3e2-a556-45b3-b1a3-685ba9359e68)
```

You should now see a new request in Teleport, and a message about the request on Slack. 

![Slack Channel Messages](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/slack-approval-deny.png)

You can approve or deny it and `tsh` should log in successfully or error out right after you click an action button on Slack.

### Setup with systemd

In production, we recommend starting the Teleport plugin daemon via an init system like `systemd`.

Here's the recommended Teleport Plugin service unit file for `systemd`:

```bash
(!examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-slack.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-slack.service`.

## Resources

- It's best practice to periodically review Teleport's [audit log](../../admin-guide.mdx#audit-log).
- Review the Plugin [source code](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins).
