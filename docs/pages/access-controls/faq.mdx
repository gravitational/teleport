# Access Controls FAQ

**Q:** What if a node has multiple labels?

**A:** In this case, the access will be granted only if **all of the labels**
defined in the role are present. This effectively means Teleport uses an "AND"
operator when evaluating node-level access using labels.

**Q:** Can I use node-level RBAC with OpenSSH servers?

**A:** No. OpenSSH servers running `sshd` do not have the ability to label
themselves. This is one of the reasons to run Teleport `node` service instead.
