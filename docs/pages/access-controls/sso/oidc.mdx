h1: OAuth2 / OIDC Authentication for SSH
---

This guide will explain how to configure an SSO provider using [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/)
(also known as OIDC) to issue SSH credentials to a specific groups of users.
When used in combination with role based access control (RBAC) it allows SSH
administrators to define policies like:

- Only members of "DBA" group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to the SSO/IdP being integrated with users assigned to groups/roles.
- Teleport role with access to maintaining `oidc` resources. This is available in the default `editor` role.

## Enable default OIDC authentication

## Identity Providers

Register Teleport with the external identity provider you will be using and
obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret`. This information should be
documented on the identity providers website. Here are a few links:

- [Auth0 Client Configuration](https://auth0.com/docs/applications)
- [Google Identity Platform](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)
- [Keycloak Client Registration](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#\_client_registration)

Add your OIDC connector information to `teleport.yaml`. A few examples are
provided below.

## OIDC Redirect URL

OIDC relies on HTTP re-directs to return control back to Teleport after
authentication is complete. The redirect URL must be selected by a Teleport
administrator in advance.

If the Teleport web proxy is running on `proxy.example.com` host, the redirect URL
should be `https://proxy.example.com:3080/webapi/oidc/callback`

## OIDC connector configuration

The next step is to add an OIDC connector to Teleport. The connectors are manipulated
via `tctl` [resource commands](../../reference/resources.mdx). To create a new connector,
create a connector resource file in YAML format, for example `oidc-connector.yaml`.

The file contents are shown below. This connector requests the scope `group`
from the identity provider then mapping the value to either to `admin` role or
the `user` role depending on the value returned for `group` within the claims.

```yaml
(!examples/resources/oidc-connector.yaml!)
```

Create the connector:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
$ tctl create oidc-connector.yaml
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=myuser
$ tctl create oidc-connector.yaml
```

</ScopedBlock>

## Create Teleport Roles

The next step is to define Teleport roles. They are created using the same
`tctl` [resource commands](../../reference/resources.mdx) as we used for the auth
connector.

Below are two example roles that are mentioned above, the first is an admin
with full access to the system while the second is a developer with limited
access.

```yaml
# role-admin.yaml
kind: "role"
version: "v3"
metadata:
  name: "admin"
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: "90h0m0s"
  allow:
    logins: [root]
    node_labels:
      "*": "*"
    rules:
      - resources: ["*"]
        verbs: ["*"]
```

Users are only allowed to login to nodes labelled with `access: relaxed`
teleport label. Developers can log in as either `ubuntu` to a username that
arrives in their assertions. Developers also do not have any rules needed to
obtain admin access.

```yaml
# role-dev.yaml
kind: "role"
version: "v3"
metadata:
  name: "dev"
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: "90h0m0s"
  allow:
    logins: [ "{{external.username}}", ubuntu ]
    node_labels:
      access: relaxed
```

Create both roles:

```code
$ tctl create role-admin.yaml
$ tctl create role-dev.yaml
```

### Optional: ACR Values

Teleport supports sending Authentication Context Class Reference (ACR) values
when obtaining an authorization code from an OIDC provider. By default ACR
values are not set. However, if the `acr_values` field is set, Teleport expects
to receive the same value in the `acr` claim, otherwise it will consider the
callback invalid.

In addition, Teleport supports OIDC provider specific ACR value processing
which can be enabled by setting the `provider` field in OIDC configuration. At
the moment, the only build-in support is for NetIQ.

A example of using ACR values and provider specific processing is below:

```yaml
# example connector which uses ACR values
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: "oidc-connector"
spec:
  issuer_url: "https://oidc.example.com"
  client_id: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.example.com"
  client_secret: "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
  redirect_url: "https://<cluster-url>:3080/webapi/oidc/callback"
  display: "Login with Example"
  acr_values: "foo/bar"
  provider: netiq
  scope: [ "group" ]
  claims_to_roles:
     - claim: "group"
       value: "editor"
       roles: [ "editor" ]
     - claim: "group"
       value: "user"
       roles: [ "access" ]
```

### Optional: Redirect URL and Timeout

The redirect URL must be accessible by all user, optional redirect timeout.

```yaml
# Extra parts of OIDC yaml have been removed.
spec:
  redirect_url: https://<cluster-url>.example.com:3080/webapi/oidc/callback
  # Optional Redirect Timeout.
  # redirect_timeout: 90s
```

### Optional: Prompt

By default, Teleport will prompt end users to select an account each time they log in
even if the user only has one account.

Teleport now lets Teleport Admins configure this option. Since `prompt` is optional, by setting the variable to `none`, Teleport will override the default `select_account`.

```yaml
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: connector
spec:
  prompt: 'none'
```

The below example will prompt the end-user for reauthentication and will require consent
from the client.

```yaml
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: connector
spec:
  prompt: 'login consent'
```

A list of available optional prompt parameters are available from the
[OpenID website](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1\_0.html#AuthRequest).

### Optional: Disable email verification

By default, Teleport will validate the `email_verified` claim, and users who attempt to sign in without a verified email address will be prevented from doing so.

For testing and other purposes, you may opt out of this behavior by enabling `allow_unverified_email` in your OIDC connector. This option weakens the overall security of the system, so we do not recommend enabling it.

```yaml
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: connector
spec:
  allow_unverified_email: true
```

### Optional: Specify a claim to use as the username

By default, Teleport will use the user's email as their Teleport username.

You can define a `username_claim` to specify the claim that should be used as the username instead.

```yaml
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: connector
spec:
  # Use the `preferred_username` claim as the user's Teleport username.
  username_claim: preferred_username
```

## Testing

For the Web UI, if the above configuration were real, you would see a button
that says `Login with Example`. Simply click on that and you will be
re-directed to a login page for your identity provider and if successful,
redirected back to Teleport.

For console login, you simple type `tsh --proxy <proxy-addr> ssh <server-addr>`
and a browser window should automatically open taking you to the login page for
your identity provider. `tsh` will also output a link the login page of the
identity provider if you are not automatically redirected.
