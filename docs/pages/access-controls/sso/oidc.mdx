title: OAuth2 and OIDC authentication
description: How to configure Teleport access with OAuth2 or OIDC (OpenID connect)
---

This guide will explain how to configure an SSO provider using [OpenID
Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) (also known as OIDC) to issue Teleport
credentials to a specific groups of users. When used in combination with role
based access control (RBAC) it allows Teleport administrators to define
policies like:

- Only members of the "DBA" group can connect to PostgreSQL databases.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to the SSO/IdP being integrated with users assigned to groups/roles.
- Teleport role with access to maintaining `oidc` resources. This is available
  in the default `editor` role.

## Identity Providers

Register Teleport with the external identity provider you will be using and
obtain your `client_id` and `client_secret`. This information should be
documented on the identity providers website. Here are a few links:

- [Auth0 Client Configuration](https://auth0.com/docs/applications)
- [Google Identity Platform](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)
- [Keycloak Client Registration](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#\_client_registration)

<Admonition type="tip">
For Google Workspace please follow our dedicated [Guide](google-workspace.mdx)
</Admonition>

Save the relevant information from your identity provider. To make following
this guide easier, you can add the values here and they will be included in the
example commands below:

- Client ID: <Var name="<CLIENT-ID>" description="The Client ID for your Teleport application, provided by your IdP"/>
- Client secret: <Var name="<CLIENT-SECRET>" description="The Client secret for your Teleport application, provided by your IdP"/>

## OIDC Redirect URL

OIDC relies on HTTP redirects to return control back to Teleport after
authentication is complete. The redirect URL must be selected by a Teleport
administrator in advance.

The redirect URL for OIDC authentication in Teleport is <nobr><Var
name="mytenant.teleport.sh" description="Your Teleport Cloud tenant or Proxy
Service address"/>`/v1/webapi/oidc/callback`</nobr>. Replace `mytenant.teleport.sh`
with your Teleport Cloud tenant or Proxy Service address.

## OIDC connector configuration

The next step is to add an OIDC connector to Teleport. The connectors are
created, test, and added / removed via `tctl` [resource commands](../../reference/resources.mdx).

To create a new connector, use `tctl sso configure`. Our example creates a
connector resource file in YAML format named `oidc-connector.yaml`:

```code
$ tctl sso configure oidc --name <CONNECTOR-NAME> \
  --issuer-url <PATH-TO-PROVIDER> \
  --id <CLIENT-ID> --secret <CLIENT-SECRET> \
  --claims-to-roles <CLAIM-KEY>,<CLAIM-VALUE>,access \
  --claims-to-roles <CLAIM-KEY>,<CLAIM-VALUE>,editor > oidc-connector.yaml
```

- `--name`: Usually the name of the IdP, this is how the connector will be
  identified in Teleport.
- `--issuer-url`: This is the base path to the IdP's OIDC configuration endpoint,
  excluding `.well-known/openid-configuration`. If, for example, the endpoint
  is `https://example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`, you would use
  `example.com`.
- `--id`: The client ID as defined in the IdP. Depending on your identity
  provider this may be something you can define (i.e. `teleport`), or may be an
  assigned string.
- `--secret`: The client token/secret provided by the IdP to authorize this client.
- `--claims-to-roles`: A mapping of OIDC claims/values to be associated with
  Teleport roles.

For more information on these and all available flags, see the [tctl sso configure
oidc](/docs/reference/cli.mdx#tctl-sso-configure-oidc) section of the Teleport CLI
Reference page.

The file created should look like the example below. This connector requests
the scope `<CLAIM-KEY>` from the identity provider, then maps the value to
either the `access` or the `editor` role depending on the value returned for
that key within the claims:

```yaml
(!examples/resources/oidc-connector.yaml!)
```

<Details title="Practical Example: Keycloak">
The following example was generated using Keycloak as the identity provider.
Keycloak is being served at `keycloak.example.com`, and the Teleport Proxy
Service is listening at `teleport.example.com`. In Keycloak, the client is
named `teleport`, and under the `teleport-dedicated` client scope we've added
the "Group Membership" mapper:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: keycloak
spec:
  claims_to_roles:
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - access
    value: /users
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - editor
    value: /admins
  client_id: teleport
  client_secret: abc123...
  issuer_url: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/master
  redirect_url: https://teleport.example.com:443/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
version: v3

```

</Details>

Before applying the connector to your cluster, you can test that it's configured
correctly:

```code
$ cat oidc-connector | tctl sso test
```

This should open up your web browser and attempt to log you in to the Teleport
cluster through your IdP. If it fails, review the output of this command for
troubleshooting details.

<Admonition type="tip">
The "[OIDC] Claims" section of the CLI output provides all the details of your
user provided by the IdP. This is a good starting point while troubleshooting
errors like `Failed to calculate user attributes.`
</Admonition>

One your tests are successful, create the connector:

```code
$ tctl create -f oidc-connector.yaml
```

### Optional: ACR Values

Teleport supports sending Authentication Context Class Reference (ACR) values
when obtaining an authorization code from an OIDC provider. By default ACR
values are not set. However, if the `acr_values` field is set, Teleport expects
to receive the same value in the `acr` claim, otherwise it will consider the
callback invalid.

In addition, Teleport supports OIDC provider specific ACR value processing
which can be enabled by setting the `provider` field in OIDC configuration. At
the moment, the only build-in support is for NetIQ.

A example of using ACR values and provider specific processing is below:

```yaml
# example connector which uses ACR values
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: "oidc-connector"
spec:
  issuer_url: "https://oidc.example.com"
  client_id: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.example.com"
  client_secret: "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
  redirect_url: "https://mytenant.teleport.sh/v1/webapi/oidc/callback"
  display: "Login with Example"
  acr_values: "foo/bar"
  provider: netiq
  scope: [ "group" ]
  claims_to_roles:
     - claim: "group"
       value: "editor"
       roles: [ "editor" ]
     - claim: "group"
       value: "user"
       roles: [ "access" ]
```

### Optional: Redirect URL and Timeout

The redirect URL must be accessible by all user, optional redirect timeout.

```yaml
# Extra parts of OIDC yaml have been removed.
spec:
  redirect_url: https://<cluster-url>.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
  # Optional Redirect Timeout.
  # redirect_timeout: 90s
```

### Optional: Disable email verification

By default, Teleport will validate the `email_verified` claim, and users who
attempt to sign in without a verified email address will be prevented from doing so:

```text
ERROR: SSO flow failed.
identity provider callback failed with error: OIDC provider did not verify email.
        email not verified by OIDC provider
```

For testing and other purposes, you may opt out of this behavior by enabling
`allow_unverified_email` in your OIDC connector. This option weakens the overall
security of the system, so we do not recommend enabling it.

```yaml
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: connector
spec:
  allow_unverified_email: true
```

### Optional: Specify a claim to use as the username

By default, Teleport will use the user's email as their Teleport username.

You can define a `username_claim` to specify the claim that should be used as
the username instead:

```yaml
kind: oidc
version: v2
metadata:
  name: connector
spec:
  # Use the `preferred_username` claim as the user's Teleport username.
  username_claim: preferred_username
```
