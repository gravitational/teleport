## How to use GitLab as a single sign-on (SSO) provider with Teleport

This guide will cover how to configure [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/) to issue
SSH credentials to specific groups of users. When used in combination with role
based access control (RBAC), it allows administrators to define policies
like:

- Only members of "DBA" group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Only members of "ProductionKubernetes" can access production Kubernetes clusters
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.

## Prerequisites

- At least two groups in GitLab with users assigned.
- Teleport role with access to maintaining `oidc` resources.  This is available in the default `editor` role.

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Enable default OIDC authentication

(!docs/pages/includes/enterprise/oidcauthentication.mdx!)

## Configure GitLab

You should have at least one group configured in GitLab to map to Teleport roles. In this example we use the names `gitlab-dev` and `gitlab-admin`.  Assign users to each of these groups.

1. Create a Application in one of your Groups that will allow using GitLab as a OAuth provider to Teleport.

Settings

- Redirect URL `https://<proxy url>/v1/webapi/oidc/callback` such as `https://teleport.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/oidc/callback`
- Check `Confidential`, `openid`, `profile`, and `email`.

1. Collect the `Application ID` and `Secret` in the Application. These will be
   used in the Teleport OIDC auth connector:

These will be used in the Teleport OIDC Auth Connector.

1. Confirm the GitLab issuer address.

For GitLab cloud that is `https://gitlab.com`. That allows accessing the Open-ID configuration at `https://gitlab.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
If you are self hosting that is likely another local address.

## Configure Teleport

### Create a OIDC Connector

Create a OIDC connector [resource](../../reference/resources.mdx):
Replace the Application ID and the Secret with the values from GitLab.

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: gitlab
spec:
  claims_to_roles:
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - admin
    value: gitlab-admin
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - dev
    value: gitlab-dev
  client_id: Application_ID
  client_secret: Secret
  display: GitLab
  issuer_url: https://gitlab.com
  prompt: "none"
  redirect_url: https://teleport.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
  scope:
  - email
version: v2
```

<Admonition

  title="IMPORTANT"
>
  The `prompt` value must be `none`.  Setting to `none` means Teleport will not send this as a parameter sending the `select_account` parameter will result in an error from GitLab.
</Admonition>

Create the connector using `tctl` tool:

```code
$ tctl create oidc-connector.yaml
```

## Create Teleport Roles

We are going to create 2 roles, privileged role admin who is able to login as
root and is capable of administrating the cluster and non-privileged dev.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: admin
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [root]
    node_labels:
      "*": "*"
    rules:
      - resources: ["*"]
        verbs: ["*"]
```

The developer role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [ "{{email.local(external.email)}}", ubuntu ]
    node_labels:
      access: relaxed
```

- Devs are only allowed to login to nodes labelled with `access: relaxed` label.
- Developers can log in as `ubuntu` user
- Notice `{{external.email}}` login. It configures Teleport to look at
  *"email"* GitLab claim and use that field as an allowed login for each user.  The `email.local(external.trait)` function will remove the `@domain` and just have the username prefix.
- Developers also do not have any "allow rules" i.e. they will not be able to
  see/replay past sessions or re-configure the Teleport cluster.

Create both roles on the auth server:

```code
$ tctl create admin.yaml
$ tctl create dev.yaml
```

## Testing

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with GitLab". The CLI is
the same as before:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=teleport.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL (and will try to open it
automatically in a browser).

  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  Teleport can use multiple OIDC/SAML connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=connector_name`
</Admonition>

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="IMPORTANT"
>
  Teleport only supports sending party initiated flows for OIDC Connect. This
  means you can not initiate login from your identity provider, you have to
  initiate login from either the Teleport Web UI or CLI.
