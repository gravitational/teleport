# Getting Started

In Teleport, any local, SSO or robot user can be a member of one or several
roles. Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, kubernetes clusters and web apps.

We will start with local users and preset roles, map SSO users to roles and wrap up
with creating your own role.

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Teleport](../getting-started.mdx) or [Teleport Cloud](../cloud.mdx) >= {{teleport_version}}
- [Tctl admin tool](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) >= {{teleport_version}}

Verify that your Teleport client is connected:

```bash
$ tctl status
Cluster  acme.example.com
Version  6.0.2
Host CA  never updated
User CA  never updated
Jwt CA   never updated
CA pin   sha256:e63c7c44be468d37a5b0276b70e9d10b17f24f4be19d6b579810fc94eaa31783
```

## Step 1/3 Add local users with preset roles

Teleport provides a couple of preset roles: `admin`, `editor`, `auditor` and `access`.
Members of `editor` role can modify cluster configuration, members of `auditor`
role can view audit logs, and `access` members can access cluster resources.
Members of `admin`, are full cluster administrators.

Invite a local user Alice as cluster `editor`:

```bash
$ tctl users add alice --roles=editor
```

Once Alice signs up, she will be able to edit cluster configuration. You can list
users and their roles using `tctl users ls`.

```bash
$ tctl users ls
User                 Roles
-------------------- -------------- 
alice                editor
admin@example.com    admin
```

You can update user's roles using `tctl users update` command:

```bash
# Once Alice relogins, she will be able to view audit logs
$ tctl users update alice --set-roles=editor,auditor
```

Because Alice has two roles, permissions from those role create a union -
she will be able to act as a system administrator and auditor at the same time.

## Step 2/3 Map SSO users to roles

We are going to setup Github connector for OSS and Okta for Enterprises version.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Open Source">

Save the file below as `github.yaml` and update the fields. You will need to set up
[Github OAuth 2.0 Connector](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/) app.
Any member belonging to the Github organization `octocats` and on team `admin` will be able to assume a built-in role `access`.

```yaml
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  # connector name that will be used with `tsh --auth=github login`
  name: github
spec:
  # client ID of Github OAuth app
  client_id: client-id
  # client secret of Github OAuth app
  client_secret: client-secret
  # This name will be shown on UI login screen
  display: Github
  # Change tele.example.com to your domain name
  redirect_url: https://tele.example.com:443/v1/webapi/github/callback
  # Map github teams to teleport roles
  teams_to_logins:
    - organization: octocats # Github organization name
      team: admin            # Github team name within that organization
      # map github admin team to Teleport's "access" role
      logins: ["access"]
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Enterprise">

Follow [SAML Okta Guide](../enterprise/sso/ssh-okta.mdx#configure-okta) to create a SAML app.
Check out [OIDC guides](../enterprise/sso/oidc.mdx#identity-providers) for OpenID Connect apps.
Save the file below as `okta.yaml` and update the `acs` field.
Any member in Okta group `okta-admin` will assume a builtin role `admin`.

```yaml
kind: saml
version: v2
metadata:
  name: okta
spec:
  acs: https://tele.example.com/v1/webapi/saml/acs
  attributes_to_roles:
  - {name: "groups", value: "okta-admin", roles: ["access"]}
  entity_descriptor: |
    <?xml !!! Make sure to shift all lines in XML descriptor
    with 4 spaces, otherwise things will not work
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 3/3 Create a custom role

Let's create a custom role for interns. Interns will have access
to test or staging SSH servers as `readonly` users. We will let them
view some monitoring web applications and dev kubernetes cluster.

Save this role as `interns.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: interns
spec:
  allow:
    # Logins configures SSH login principals
    logins: ['readonly']
    # Assigns members of this role to built-in kubernetes group view
    kubernetes_groups: ["view"]
    # Allow access to SSH nodes, kubernetes clusters, apps or databases labeled with staging or test
    node_labels:
      'env': ['staging', 'test']
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
    app_labels:
      'type': ['monitoring']
  # The deny rules always override allow rules.
  deny:
    # deny access to any node, database, app or kubernetes cluster labeled
    # as prod as any user.
    node_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    db_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
    app_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

Create a role using `tctl create -f` command:

```bash
$ tctl create -f /tmp/interns.yaml
# Get list of all roles in the system
$ tctl get roles --format text
```
