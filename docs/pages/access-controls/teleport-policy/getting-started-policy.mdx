description: A reference for Access Graph with Teleport Policy.
---

Teleport Policy streamlines and centralizes access management across your entire infrastructure. Access Graph provides a 
visual representation of the relationships between users, roles, and resources in your organization. 
It can help you answer questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

## Getting started with Teleport Policy

Access Graph is a feature of the Teleport Policy product that is only 
available to Teleport Enterprise customers.

After logging into the Teleport UI, go to the Management tab. If enabled, Access Graph options can be found
under the Permission Management section.

<Admonition type="note">
Note: For managed Teleport Enterprise customers, Access Graph is enabled by default.
If you are a self-hosted Teleport customer, you will need to set up [Access Graph](../access-graph/self-hosted.mdx) and ensure you have an updated 
`license.pem` with Teleport Policy enabled to use it.

## Next steps
- Set up [Policy integrations](./policy-integrations.mdx) for use with Access Graph.
