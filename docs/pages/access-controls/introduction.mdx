h1: Access Controls for SSH, Kubernetes, Databases and Web Apps
---

## Introduction

Here are examples of access policies you can define with Teleport:

- Analytics team members can SSH into the MongoDB read replica, but not the main database.
- Interns can't access production databases.
- Devops can access the production server only when using a registered second factor hardware device.
- Members of my team can access the production Kubernetes cluster if approved by someone else from the team.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is almost always used in conjunction with Single Sign-On (SSO), GitHub (in the Teleport Open Source Edition), and OIDC or SAML (in the Teleport Enterprise editions).

It also works with users stored in Teleport's internal database.

## Getting started

Configure Access Controls in a 5 minute [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx)
guide.

## Guides

- [Dual Authorization](./guides/dual-authz.mdx): Dual Authorization for SSH and Kubernetes.
- [Teleport Role Templates](./guides/role-templates.mdx): Dynamic Access Policies with Role Templates.
- [Impersonating Teleport Users](./guides/impersonation.mdx): Create certs for CI/CD using impersonation.
- [Passwordless](./guides/passwordless.mdx): Use passwordless authentication (Preview).
- [Second Factor - WebAuthn](./guides/webauthn.mdx): Add Two-Factor Authentication through WebAuthn.
- [Per-session MFA](./guides/per-session-mfa.mdx): Per-session Multi-Factor Authentication.
- [Locking](./guides/locking.mdx): Locking sessions and identities.

## How does it work?

Consider a company using [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) to authenticate users and place
them into groups. A typical deployment of Teleport in this scenario
would involve:

- Configuring Teleport to use existing user identities stored in Okta.
- Okta would have users placed in certain groups, perhaps `developers`, `admins`, `contractors`, and so on.
- Teleport would have certain Teleport *Roles* defined: `developers` and `admins`.
- Mappings would connect the Okta groups (SAML assertions) to the defined Teleport roles.

Every Teleport user will be assigned a Teleport role based on their Okta group membership.
