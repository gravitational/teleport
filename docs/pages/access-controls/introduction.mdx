h1: Access Controls for SSH, Kubernetes, Databases and Web Apps
---

## Introduction

Here are examples of access policies you can define with Teleport:

- Analytics team members can SSH into the MongoDB read replica, but not the main database.
- Interns can't access production databases.
- Devops can access the production server only when using a registered U2F hardware token.
- Members of my team can access the production Kubernetes cluster if approved by someone else from the team.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is almost always used in conjunction with Single Sign-On (SSO), Github (in the Teleport Open Source Edition), and OIDC or SAML (in the Teleport Enterprise editions).

It also works with users stored in Teleport's internal database.

## How does it work?

Consider a company using [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) to authenticate users and place
them into groups. A typical deployment of Teleport in this scenario
would involve:

1. Configuring Teleport to use existing user identities stored in Okta.
2. Okta would have users placed in certain groups, perhaps `developers`, `admins`, `contractors`, and so on.
3. Teleport would have certain Teleport *Roles* defined: `developers` and `admins`.
4. Mappings would connect the Okta groups (SAML assertions) to the defined Teleport roles.

Every Teleport user will be assigned a Teleport role based on their Okta group membership.
