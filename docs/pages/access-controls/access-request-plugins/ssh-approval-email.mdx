title: Teleport Access Requests with Email
description: How to set up the Teleport email plugin to notify users when another user requests elevated privileges.
---

This guide will explain how to set up Teleport to send Just-in-Time Access
Request notifications to users via email. Since all organizations use email for
at least some of their communications, Teleport's email plugin makes it
straightforward to integrate Access Requests into your existing workflows,
letting you implement security best practices without compromising productivity.

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/diagram.mdx api="SMTP service" action="Listen for Access Requests" messages="Email messages" !)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- Access to an SMTP service. The Teleport email plugin supports either Mailgun
  or a generic SMTP service that authenticates via username and password.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Protecting your email account">

The Teleport plugin needs to use a username and password to authenticate to your
SMTP service. To mitigate the risk of these credentials being leaked, you should
set up a dedicated email account for the Teleport plugin and rotate the password
regularly.

</Admonition>

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/7. Define RBAC resources

Before you set up the email plugin, you will need to enable Role Access Requests
in your Teleport cluster.

(!/docs/pages/includes/plugins/editor-request-rbac.mdx!)

## Step 2/7. Install the Teleport email plugin

<ScopedBlock scope={["enterprise", "oss"]}>

We recommend installing Teleport plugins on the same host as the Teleport Proxy
Service. This is an ideal location as plugins have a low memory footprint, and
will require both public internet access and Teleport Auth Service access. 

</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

Install the Teleport email plugin on a host that can access both your
Teleport Cloud tenant and your SMTP service.

</ScopedBlock>

<Details title="Using a local SMTP server?">

If you are using a local SMTP server to test the plugin, you should install the
plugin on your local machine. This is because the plugin needs to dial out to
your SMTP server and perform any necessary DNS lookups in order to send email.

Your Teleport cluster does *not* need to perform DNS lookups for your plugin, as
the plugin dials out to the Proxy Service or Auth Service. 

</Details>

We currently only provide Linux amd64 binaries. You can also compile the plugin
from source.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Download">
  ```code
  $ curl -L https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-email-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf teleport-access-email-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ cd teleport-access-email
  $ ./install
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="From Source">

  To install from source you need `git` and `go` installed. If you do not have
  Go installed, visit the Go [downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).

  ```code
  # Checkout teleport-plugins
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
  $ cd teleport-plugins/access/email
  $ make
  ```

  Move the `teleport-email` binary from `teleport-plugins/access/email/build`
  into a directory in your `PATH`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Ensure that the plugin is installed correctly:

```code
$ teleport-email version
```

## Step 3/7. Create a user and role for the plugin

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/rbac.mdx!)

## Step 4/7. Export the access plugin identity

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/identity-export.mdx user="access-plugin"!)

## Step 5/7. Configure the plugin

At this point, you have generated credentials that the email plugin will use to
connect to Teleport. You will now configure the plugin to use these credentials
to receive Access Request notifications from Teleport and email them to your
chosen recipients.

The Teleport email plugin uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a
boilerplate config by running the following command:

```code
$ teleport-email configure | sudo tee /etc/teleport-email.toml
```

Edit the configuration file for your environment. We will show you how to set
each value below.

### `[teleport]`

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/config-toml-teleport.mdx!)

### `[mailgun]` or `[smtp]`

Provide the credentials for your SMTP service depending on whether you are using
Mailgun or SMTP service.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Mailgun">

In the `mailgun` section, assign `domain` to the domain name and subdomain of
your Mailgun account. Assign `private_key` to your Mailgun private key.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Generic SMTP Service">

Assign `host` to the fully qualified domain name of your SMTP service, omitting
the URL scheme and port. (If you're using a local SMTP server for testing, use
`"localhost"` for `host`.) Assign `port` to the port of your SMTP service, then
fill in `username` and `password`.

<Notice type="tip">

You can also save your password to a separate file and assign `password_file` to
the file's path. The plugin reads the file and uses the file's content as the
password.

</Notice>

<Details title="Disabling TLS for testing">

If you are testing the email plugin against a trusted internal SMTP server where
you would rather not use TLS—e.g., a local SMTP server on your development
machine—you can assign the `starttls_policy` setting to `disabled` (always
disable TLS) or `opportunistic` (disable TLS if the server does not advertise
the `STARTTLS` extension). The default is to always enforce TLS, and you should
leave this setting unassigned unless you know what you are doing and understand
the risks.

</Details>

### `[delivery]`

Assign `sender` to the email address from which you would like the Teleport
plugin to send messages.

### `[role_to_recipients]`

The `role_to_recipients` map configure the recipients that the email plugin
will notify when a user requests access to a specific role. When the plugin
receives an Access Request from the Auth Service, it will look up the role being
requested and identify the recipients to notify.

Here is an example of a `role_to_recipients` map:

```toml
[role_to_recipients]
"*" = ["security@example.com", "executive-team@example.com"]
"dev" = "eng@example.com"
"dba" = "mallory@example.com"
```

In the `role_to_recipients` map, each key is the name of a Teleport role. Each
value configures the recipients the plugin will email when it receives an Access
Request for that role. The value can be a single string or an array of strings.
Each string must be an email address.

The `role_to_recipients` map must also include an entry for `"*"`, which the
plugin looks up if no other entry matches a given role name. In the example
above, requests for roles aside from `dev` and `dba` will notify
`security@example.com` and `executive-team@example.com`.

<Details title="Suggested reviewers">

Users can suggest reviewers when they create an Access Request, e.g.,:

```code
$ tsh request create --roles=dbadmin --reviewers=alice@example.com,ivan@example.com
```
If an Access Request includes suggested reviewers, the email plugin will add
these to the list of recipients to notify. If a suggested reviewer is an email
address, the plugin will send a message to that recipient in addition to those
configured in `role_to_recipients`.

</Details>

Configure the email plugin to notify you when a user requests the `editor` role
by adding the following to your `role_to_recipients` config, replacing
`YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with the appropriate address: 

```toml
[role_to_recipients]
"*" = "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
"editor" = "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
```

<Details title="Configuring recipients without role mapping">

If you do not plan to use role-to-recipient mapping, you can configure the
Teleport email plugin to notify a static list of recipients for every Access
Request event by using the `delivery.recipients` field:

```toml
[delivery]
recipients = ["eng@exmaple.com", "dev@example.com"]
```

If you use `delivery.recipients`, you must remove the `role_to_recipients`
configuration section. Behind the scenes, `delivery.recipients` assigns the
recipient list to a `role_to_recipients` mapping under the wildcard value `"*"`.

</Details>

You configuration should resemble the following:

```toml
# /etc/teleport-email.toml
[teleport]
addr = "example.com:443"
identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/auth_id"

[mailgun]
domain = "sandboxbd81caddef744a69be0e5b544ab0c3bd.mailgun.org" 
private_key = "xoxb-fakekey62b0eac53565a38c8cc0316f6"                                     

# As an alternative, you can use SMTP server credentials:
#
# [smtp]
# host = "smtp.gmail.com"
# port = 587
# username = "username@gmail.com"
# password = ""
# password_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/smtp_password"

[delivery]
sender = "noreply@example.com" 

[role_to_recipients]
"*" = "eng@example.com"
"editor" = ["admin@example.com", "execs@example.com"]

[log]
output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/email.log"
severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".
```

## Step 6/7. Test the email plugin

After finishing your configuration, you can now run the plugin and test your
email-based Access Request flow:

```code
$ teleport-email start
```

If everything works as expected, the log output should look like this:

```code
$ teleport-email start
INFO   Starting Teleport Access Email Plugin (): email/app.go:80
INFO   Plugin is ready email/app.go:101
```

### Create an Access Request

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/create-request.mdx!)

The recipients you configured earlier should receive notifications of the
request by email. 

### Resolve the request

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/resolve-request.mdx!)

## Step 7/7. Set up systemd

In production, we recommend starting the Teleport plugin daemon via an init
system like systemd. Here's the recommended Teleport plugin service unit file
for systemd:

```ini
(!/examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-email.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-email.service` in either `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` or
another [unit file load
path](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Unit%20File%20Load%20Path)
supported by systemd.

Enable and start the plugin:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport-email
$ sudo systemctl start teleport-email
```
