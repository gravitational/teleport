title: Resource Access Requests
description: Teleport allows users to request access to specific resources from the CLI or UI. Requests can be escalated via ChatOps or anywhere else via our flexible Authorization Workflow API.
---

<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
  Resource Access Requests are currently in Preview.
</Admonition>

With Teleport Resource Access Requests, users can request access to specific
resources without needing to know anything about the roles or RBAC controls used
under the hood.
The Access Request API makes it easy to dynamically approve or deny these
requests.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss"]}>

Just-in-time Access Requests are a feature of Teleport Enterprise.
Open-source Teleport users can get a preview of how Access Requests work by
requesting a role via the Teleport CLI. Full Access Request functionality,
including Resource Access Requests and an intuitive and searchable UI are
available in Teleport Enterprise.

</ScopedBlock>

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

<Admonition type="warning">
All `teleport` instances in the cluster must be running Teleport `v10.0.0` or
greater in order for Resource Access Requests to be properly enforced.
Older versions of `teleport` will only do RBAC checks based on roles and will
not respect resource restrictions.
It is not recommended to enable Resource Access Requests by setting any
`search_as_roles` until all `teleport` instances in your cluster have been
upgraded to version 10.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/8. Create the requester role

This role allows the requester to search for resources accessible by the
`access` role (all resources by default) and request access to them.

```yaml
# requester.yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: requester
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - access
```

```code
$ tctl create requester.yaml
```

## Step 2/8. Create the reviewer role

This role allows the reviewer to approve all requests for the `access` role.

```yaml
# reviewer.yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      roles:
        - access
      preview_as_roles:
        - access
```

```code
$ tctl create reviewer.yaml
```

## Step 3/8. Grant the roles to users

Grant the `requester` and `reviewer` roles to existing users, or create new
users to test this feature.
Make sure the requester has a valid `login` so that they can view and access SSH
nodes.

```code
$ tctl users add alice --roles requester --logins alice
$ tctl users add bob --roles reviewer
```

For the rest of the guide we will assume that the `requester` role has been
granted to a user named `alice` and the `reviewer` role has been granted to a
user named `bob`.

## Step 4/8. Search for resources

First, log in as `alice`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user alice
```

Notice that `tsh ls` returns an empty list, because `alice` does not have access to any resources by default.
```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address Labels
--------- ------- ------
```

Then try searching for all available ssh nodes.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738
bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f node        test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason <request reason>
```

You can search for resources of kind `node`, `kube_cluster`, `pod`, `db`, `app`, and
`windows_desktop`. Advanced filters and queries are supported. See our
[filtering reference](../../reference/cli.mdx#resource-filtering) for more information.

Try narrowing your search to a specific resource you want to access.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node --search iot
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 \
    --reason <request reason>
```

## Step 5/8. Request access to a resource

Copy the command output by `tsh request search` in the previous step, optionally filling in a request reason.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"
Creating request...

Reason:     "responding to incident 123"
Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING

hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request

Waiting for request approval...

```

The command will automatically wait until the request is approved.

## Step 6/8. Approve the Access Request

First, log in as `bob`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user bob
```

Then list, review, and approve the Access Request.

```code
$ tsh request ls

      use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request
$ tsh request show f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab

hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request
$ tsh request review --approve f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
Successfully submitted review.  Request state: APPROVED
```

## Step 7/8. Access the requested resource

`alice`'s `tsh request create` command should resolve now that the request has been approved.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"

hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request

Waiting for request approval...

Approval received, getting updated certificates...

> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com
  Logged in as:       alice
  Active requests:    f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com

  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

`alice` can now view and access the node.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address   Labels
--------- --------- ---------
iot       [::]:3022 test=test

$ tsh ssh alice@iot
iot:~ alice$
```

## Step 8/8. Resume regular access

While logged in with a Resource Access Request, users will be blocked from access to any other resources.
This is necessary because their certificate now contains an elevated role,
so it is restricted to only allow access to the resources they were specifically approved for.
Use the `tsh request drop` command to "drop" the request and resume regular access.

```code
$ tsh request drop
```

## Next Steps

### Automatically request access for SSH

Once you have configured Resource Access Requests,
`tsh ssh` is able to automatically create a Resource Access Request for you when access is denied,
allowing you to skip the `tsh request search` and `tsh request create` steps.

```code
$ tsh ssh alice@iot
ERROR: access denied to alice connecting to iot on cluster teleport.example.com

You do not currently have access to alice@iot, attempting to request access.

Enter request reason: please

```

### Restrict the resources a user can request access to

In this guide, we showed you how to enable a user to search for resources to
request access to. To do so, we assigned the user a Teleport role with the
`search_as_roles` field set to the preset `access` role.

You can impose further restrictions on the resources a user is allowed to
search by assigning `search_as_roles` to a more limited role. Below, we will
show you which permissions you must set to restrict a user's ability to search
for different resources.

To restrict access to a particular resource using a role similar to the ones
below, edit one of the user's roles so the `search_as_roles` field includes the
role you have created.

#### `node`

You can restrict access to searching `node` resources by assigning values to the
`node_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields. The following
role allows access to SSH Service instances with the `env:staging` label.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: staging-access
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: staging
    logins:
      - "{{internal.logins}}"
  options:
    # Only allows the requester to use this role for 1 hour from time of request.
    max_session_ttl: 1h
```

#### `kube_cluster`

You can restrict access to searching `kube_cluster` resources by assigning
values to the `kubernetes_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny`
fields.

The following role allows access to Kubernetes clusters with the `env:staging`
label:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v6
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'staging'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "*"
        name: "*"
  deny: {}
```

#### `pod`

You can restrict access to `pod` resources by assigning values to the
`kubernetes_resources` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to Kubernetes pods with the name `nginx` in any
namespace, and all pods in the `dev` namespace:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v6
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*':'*'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "*"
        name: "nginx*"
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "dev"
        name: "*"
    kubernetes_groups:
      - viewers
  deny: {}
```

##### Access Requests for pods

Teleport users can request access to a Kubernetes pod by running the following
command:

```code
$ tsh request create <Var name="pod-id" />
```

Replace `pod-id` with the name of a pod in the following format:

```
/TELEPORT_CLUSTER/pod/KUBE_CLUSTER/NAMESPACE/POD_NAME
```

For example, to request access to a pod called `nginx-1` in the `development`
namespace, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resources /teleport.example.com/pod/mycluster/development/nginx-1
```

For the `NAMESPACE` and `POD_NAME` values, you can match ranges of characters by
supplying a wildcard (`*`) or regular expression. Regular expressions must begin
with `^` and end with `$`.

For example, to create a request to access all pods in all namespaces that match
the regular expression `/^nginx-[a-z0-9-]+$/`, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resources /teleport.example.com/pod/mycluster/*/^nginx-[a-z0-9-]+$
```

If a user has no access to a Kubernetes cluster, they can search the list of pods
in the cluster by running the following command:

```code
$ tsh request search --kind=pod --kube-cluster=<Var name="kube-cluster" /> \
[--kube-namespace=<Var name="namespace" />|--all-kube-namespaces]
Name               Namespace Labels    Resource ID
-----------------  --------- --------- ----------------------------------------------------------
nginx-deployment-0 default   app=nginx /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-0
nginx-deployment-1 default   app=nginx /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-1

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-0 --resource /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-1 \
    --reason <request reason>
```

The list returned includes the name of the pod, the namespace it is in, its labels,
and the resource ID. Pods included in the list are those that match the
`kubernetes_resources` field in the user's `search_as_roles`. The user can then:

- Request access to the pods by running the command provided by the `tsh request
search` command.
- Edit the command to request access to a subset of the pods.
- Use a custom request with wildcards or regular expressions.

`tsh request search --kind=pod` works even if the user has no permissions to interact
 with the desired Kubernetes cluster, but the user's `search_as_roles` values
must allow access to the cluster. If the user is unsure of the name of the cluster,
they can run the following command to search it:

```code
$ tsh request search --kind=kube_cluster
Name  Hostname Labels Resource ID
----- -------- ------ ----------------------------------------
local                 /teleport.example.com/kube_cluster/local

```

##### Preventing unintended access

If you are setting up a Teleport role to enable just-in-time access to a
specific Kubernetes pod, you should set the role's `kubernetes_groups` and
`kubernetes_users` to a role that has no access to Kubernetes resource beside
the target pod.

This is because, if a user requests access to a Kubernetes pod, and the request
is approved, the Teleport Kubernetes Service will use the `kubernetes_groups`
and `kubernetes_users` fields in the role to add impersonation headers to the user's
requests to a Kubernetes API server.

If the values of `kubernetes_users` and `kubernetes_groups` map to Kubernetes
users and groups with access to additional resources, the user will be able to
send requests that interact with those resources, e.g., `Secret`s and
`ConfigMap`s, depending on the privileges of the Kubernetes users and groups.

#### `db`

You can restrict access to searching `db` resources by assigning values to the
`db_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to databases with the `environment:dev` or
`environment:stage` labels:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      environment: ["dev", "stage"]

    # Database account names this role can connect as.
    db_users: ["viewer", "editor"]
    db_names: ["*"]
```

#### `app`

You can restrict access to searching `app` resources by assigning values to the
`app_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to all applications except for those in
`env:prod`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      "*": "*"
  deny:
    app_labels:
      env: "prod"
```

#### `windows_desktop`

You can restrict access to searching `windows_desktop` resources by assigning
values to the `windows_desktop_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny`
fields.

The following role allows access to all Windows desktops with the
`environment:dev` or `environment:stage` labels.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      environment: ["dev", "stage"]

    windows_desktop_logins: ["{{internal.windows_logins}}"]
```

### Allow reviewers to see the hostnames of SSH Nodes

It is possible for a reviewer to view Resource Access Requests for SSH Nodes to
which that reviewer does not have access.
In this case, the reviewer will not be able to view the hostname of the requested node
and they will only see the node's UUID.

To give the reviewer permission to view the Node hostname, use the
`allow.review_requests.preview_as_roles` field in the reviewer's role, e.g.:

```
kind: role
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      preview_as_roles: [access]
```

This can often be set to the same value as `allow.review_requests.roles`.
When any of the `preview_as_roles` set for the reviewer would allow access to
the requested node, the hostname will be displayed in the Review Request page of
the Teleport Web UI.

### Integrating with an external tool

With Teleport's Access Request plugins, users can manage Access Requests from
within your organization's existing messaging and project management solutions.

(!docs/pages/includes/access-request-integrations.mdx!)

### Using TTLs with Access Requests

`tsh request create` supports flags to control TTLs for the request and
elevated access. See the [CLI
Reference](../../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-request-create) for more
details.
