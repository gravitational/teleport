h1: Teleport Resource Access Requests
---

<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
  Resource Access Requests are currently in Preview.
</Admonition>

With Teleport Resource Access Requests, users can request access to specific
resources without needing to know anything about the roles or RBAC controls used
under the hood.
The Access Request API makes it easy to dynamically approve or deny these
requests.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss"]}>

Just-in-time Access Requests are a feature of Teleport Enterprise.
Open-source Teleport users can get a preview of how Access Requests work by
requesting a role via the Teleport CLI. Full Access Request functionality,
including Resource Access Requests and an intuitive and searchable UI are
available in Teleport Enterprise.

</ScopedBlock>

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

<Admonition type="warning">
All `teleport` instances in the cluster must be running Teleport `v10.0.0` or
greater in order for Resource Access Requests to be properly enforced.
Older versions of `teleport` will only do RBAC checks based on roles and will
not respect resource restrictions.
It is not recommended to enable Resource Access Requests by setting any
`search_as_roles` until all `teleport` instances in your cluster have been
upgraded to version 10.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/8. Create the requester role

This role allows the requester to search for resources accessible by the
`access` role (all resources by default) and request access to them.

```yaml
# requester.yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: requester
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - access
```

```code
$ tctl create requester.yaml
```

## Step 2/8. Create the reviewer role

This role allows the reviewer to approve all requests for the `access` role.

```yaml
# reviewer.yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      roles:
        - access
      preview_as_roles:
        - access
```

```code
$ tctl create reviewer.yaml
```

## Step 3/8. Grant the roles to users

Grant the `requester` and `reviewer` roles to existing users, or create new
users to test this feature.
Make sure the requester has a valid `login` so that they can view and access SSH
nodes.

```code
$ tctl users add alice --roles requester --logins alice
$ tctl users add bob --roles reviewer
```

For the rest of the guide we will assume that the `requester` role has been
granted to a user named `alice` and the `reviewer` role has been granted to a
user named `bob`.

## Step 4/8. Search for resources

First, log in as `alice`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user alice
```

Notice that `tsh ls` returns an empty list, because `alice` does not have access to any resources by default.
```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address Labels
--------- ------- ------
```

Then try searching for all available ssh nodes.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738
bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f node        test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f
 
To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason <request reason>
```

You can search for resources of kind `node`, `kube_cluster`, `db`, `app`, and `windows_desktop`.
Advanced filters and queries are supported, see our
[filtering reference](../../reference/cli.mdx#resource-filtering).

Try narrowing your search to a specific resource you want to access.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node --search iot
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738
 
To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 \
    --reason <request reason>
```

## Step 5/8. Request access to a resource

Copy the command output by `tsh request search` in the previous step, optionally filling in a request reason.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"
Creating request...
Request ID: f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
Username:   alice
Roles:      access
Resources:  ["/teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f"]
Reason:     "responding to incident 123"
Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING
 
hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request
 
Waiting for request approval...

```

The command will automatically wait until the request is approved.

## Step 6/8. Approve the Access Request

First, log in as `bob`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user bob
```

Then list, review, and approve the Access Request.

```code
$ tsh request ls
ID                                   User  Roles  Resources                   Created At (UTC)    Status
------------------------------------ ----- ------ --------------------------- ------------------- -------

[+] Requested resources truncated, use `tsh request show <request-id>` to view the full list
 
hint: use 'tsh request show <request-id>' for additional details
      use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request
$ tsh request show f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
Request ID: f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
Username:   alice
Roles:      access

Reason:     "responding to incident 123"
Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING
 
hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request
$ tsh request review --approve f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
Successfully submitted review.  Request state: APPROVED
```

## Step 7/8. Access the requested resource

`alice`'s `tsh request create` command should resolve now that the request has been approved.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"
Creating request...
Request ID: f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
Username:   alice
Roles:      access
Resources:  ["/teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f"]
Reason:     "responding to incident 123"
Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING
 
hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request
 
Waiting for request approval...
 
Approval received, getting updated certificates...
 
> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com
  Logged in as:       alice
  Active requests:    f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, requester
  Logins:             alice
  Kubernetes:         disabled
  Allowed Resources:  ["/teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f"]
  Valid until:        2022-06-23 22:46:22 -0700 PDT [valid for 11h16m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

`alice` can now view and access the node.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address   Labels
--------- --------- ---------
iot       [::]:3022 test=test
 
$ tsh ssh alice@iot
iot:~ alice$
```

## Step 8/8. Resume regular access

While logged in with a Resource Access Request, users will be blocked from access to any other resources.
This is necessary because their certificate now contains an elevated role,
so it is restricted to only allow access to the resources they were specifically approved for.
Use the `tsh request drop` command to "drop" the request and resume regular access.

```code
$ tsh request drop
```

## Next Steps

### Automatically request access for SSH

Once you have configured Resource Access Requests,
`tsh ssh` is able to automatically create a Resource Access Request for you when access is denied,
allowing you to skip the `tsh request search` and `tsh request create` steps.

```code
$ tsh ssh alice@iot
ERROR: access denied to alice connecting to iot on cluster teleport.example.com

You do not currently have access to alice@iot, attempting to request access.

Enter request reason: please
Creating request...
Request ID: ab43fc70-e893-471b-872e-ae65eb24fd76
Username:   alice
Roles:      access
Resources:  ["/teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f"]
Reason:     "please"
Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING

hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request

Waiting for request approval...
 
Approval received, reason="okay"
Getting updated certificates...
 
iot:~ alice$
```

### Restrict the resources a user can request access to

Create a role which can only access SSH nodes labeled `env:staging`.

```yaml
# staging-access.yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: staging-access
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: staging
    logins:
      - "{{internal.logins}}"
  options:
    # Only allows the requester to use this role for 1 hour from time of request.
    max_session_ttl: 1h
```

```code
$ tctl create staging-access.yaml
```

Update the `requester` and `reviewer` roles to reference `staging-access`
instead of the default `access` role.

```yaml
# requester.yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: requester
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - staging-access
      # Requires 2 approvals for the request.
      thresholds:
        - approve: 2
          deny: 1
```

```yaml
# reviewer.yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      roles:
        - staging-access
      preview_as_roles:
        - staging-access
```

```code
$ tctl create -f requester.yaml
$ tctl create -f reviewer.yaml
```

The `requester` will now only be able to search for or request access to
resources accessible by the `staging-access` role.

### Allow reviewers to see the hostnames of SSH Nodes

It is possible for a reviewer to view Resource Access Requests for SSH Nodes to
which that reviewer does not have access.
In this case, the reviewer will not be able to view the hostname of the requested node
and they will only see the node's UUID.

To give the reviewer permission to view the Node hostname, use the
`allow.review_requests.preview_as_roles` field in the reviewer's role, e.g.:

```
kind: role
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      preview_as_roles: [access]
```

This can often be set to the same value as `allow.review_requests.roles`.
When any of the `preview_as_roles` set for the reviewer would allow access to
the requested node, the hostname will be displayed in the Review Request page of
the Teleport Web UI.

### Integrating with an external tool

With Teleport's Access Request plugins, users can manage Access Requests from
within your organization's existing messaging and project management solutions.

(!docs/pages/includes/access-request-integrations.mdx!)

### Using TTLs with Access Requests

`tsh request create` supports flags to control TTLs for the request and
elevated access. See the [CLI
Reference](../../reference/cli.mdx#tsh-request-create) for more
details.
