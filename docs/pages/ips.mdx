title: Public IP Address Allowlist
description: Restrict outbound network connections from your infrastructure to cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise.

Teleport Cloud maintains a list of IP addresses it uses for ingress. If your environment restricts outbound traffic,
you can allowlist these IPs in your firewall or proxy configuration to ensure that Teleport Agents can connect to your cluster.
While not required for most deployments, this configuration can be useful in environments where outbound
connections are blocked by default, for example, when firewalls deny all internet access unless explicitly allowed.

<Admonition type="note">
    If you are a Teleport Enterprise customer and plan to use this allowlist, please open a support ticket to let us know. This allows us to provide advance notice whenever the list is updated.
