Teleport maintains Helm charts for services and plugins, including self-hosted
Auth Service and Proxy Service deployments, Teleport Agents, the Event Handler,
and Access Request plugins.

## Installing Teleport as a cluster

The `teleport-cluster` Helm chart deploys the `teleport` daemon on Kubernetes
with preset configurations for the Auth Service and Proxy Service, with support
for additional Teleport service configurations.

See [Guides for running Teleport using
Helm](../zero-trust-access/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/helm-deployments.mdx)
for instructions on using the `teleport-cluster` chart to deploy a Teleport
cluster on your Kubernetes platform.

See the [Helm chart reference
guide](../reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster.mdx) for available options.

## Installing Teleport as an agent

The `teleport-kube-agent` chart configures a Teleport Agent that runs in a
remote Kubernetes cluster to provide access to resources in your infrastructure.

The easiest way to deploy an agent in Kubernetes is in the Teleport Web UI at
`web/discover`, where a guide will lead you through a series of configuration
steps and populate the full `helm install` command for you.

See the [Helm chart reference
guide](../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx) for all available
options as well as example deployments for the various types of agents.

## Other Helm charts

Consult the [Helm chart reference](../reference/helm-reference/helm-reference.mdx) for documentation on all available Helm charts.
