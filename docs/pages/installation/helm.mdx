Teleport maintains Helm charts for services and plugins, including self-hosted
Auth Service and Proxy Service deployments, Teleport Agents, the Event Handler,
and Access Request plugins.

## Installing Teleport as a cluster

The [teleport-cluster](../reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster.mdx) chart deploys the `teleport` daemon on Kubernetes with preset configurations for the Auth and Proxy Services and support for any Teleport service configuration.

See the [Helm chart reference guide](../reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster.mdx) or our [README](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/examples/chart/teleport-cluster.mdx) on GitHub for available options and deployment examples.

You can also follow our [getting started guide](../admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/kubernetes-cluster.mdx) that will walk you through deploying Teleport on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

## Installing Teleport as an agent

The [teleport-kube-agent](../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx) chart is used to configure a Teleport Agent that runs in a remote Kubernetes cluster to provide access to resources in your infrastructure.

The easiest way to deploy an agent in Kubernetes is in the Teleport Web UI at `web/discover` where the guide will lead you through a series of configuration steps and populate the full helm install command for you.

See our [Helm chart reference guide](../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx) or our [README](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/examples/chart/teleport-kube-agent) on GitHub for all available options as well as example deployments for the various types of agents.

## Other Helm charts
Consult the [Helm chart reference](../reference/helm-reference/helm-reference.mdx) for documentation on all available Helm charts.
