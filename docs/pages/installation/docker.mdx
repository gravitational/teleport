Docker provides a convenient way to deploy Teleport in containerized environments, offering consistent deployment across platforms and simplified dependency management. Teleport's pre-built Docker images are optimized for different use cases, from production deployments to development and troubleshooting scenarios. 

In this installation guide, you'll learn how to choose the right image, configure your containers, and run Teleport services with Docker.

## Images

We provide a pre-built Docker image for every version of Teleport. This section
describes the available Docker images.

These images are hosted on [Amazon ECR
Public](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational).

### Image suffixes

For each of the image names listed in this section, you can specify attributes
of the image by appending a suffix to the repository name or tag.

Images with the `-distroless` suffix within the repository name include only the
`teleport` binary and its runtime dependencies, with no shell or utility
applications. An example is `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless`
for Teleport Community Edition.

Images with the `*-distroless-debug` suffix within the repository name include a
Busybox shell and tool suite in addition to Teleport, and are intended for
troubleshooting deployments only. They are not intended for production use. An
example is `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug`.

`*-distroless` and `*-distroless-debug` images support multiple architectures
natively, and do not require (or support) image suffixes. You can specify an
architecture using the `--platform` flag of `docker pull` to pull the `arm`,
`arm64` or `amd64` version of an image.

### Version tags

Images point to a static version of Teleport. Use the image's tag to specify
either:

- The major, minor, and patch version (e.g., `(=teleport.version=)` for the
  latest version of Teleport Community Edition).
- The major version only, which implies the latest minor and patch numbers for
  that major version. For example, `(=teleport.major_version=)` implies
  `(=teleport.version=)`.

### Interacting with distroless images

Since version 15, Teleport images are based on Google's [Distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) images.
Those images don't contain any shell.

To execute Teleport commands on containers based on these images, run commands similar to the following:

```code
# in docker
$ docker run -i my-container tctl status

# in Kubernetes
$ kubectl exec -i my-pod -- tctl status

# sending local files via stdin
$ kubectl exec -i my-pod -- tctl create -f < my-local-file.yaml

# retrieving the teleport service config file from the configmap
$ kubectl get configmap teleport-cluster-auth -o jsonpath="{.data['teleport\.yaml']}"

# retrieving output via stdout and tar
$ kubectl exec -i my-pod -- tctl auth sign --user admin --format tls --ttl 10m --tar -o admin| tar xv -C local
$ ls -l local
total 24
-rw-------  1 trent  staff  1318 Jul 24 15:52 admin.cas
-rw-------  1 trent  staff  1895 Jul 24 15:52 admin.crt
-rw-------  1 trent  staff  1679 Jul 24 15:52 admin.key
```

Alternatively, you can use the debug variant of the image, which contains [busybox](https://www.busybox.net/about.html) and a minimal shell invocable via `busybox sh`:

```code
$ docker run -it --entrypoint="" (=teleport.latest_oss_debug_docker_image=) busybox sh
```

### Machine ID (tbot)

We also provide a slimmed down distroless image that only contains the `tbot`
binary for use with Teleport Machine ID.

| Image name                                                               | FIPS Support | Image base                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/tbot-distroless:(=teleport.version=)`      | No           | [Distroless Debian 12](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) |
| `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/tbot-fips-distroless:(=teleport.version=)` | Yes          | [Distroless Debian 12](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) |

The version tagging follows the same pattern as the main `teleport-distroless`
image.

Whilst the `teleport-distroless` image also includes `tbot`, using the `tbot`
specific image should be preferred for Machine ID deployments. This image is
smaller, improving pull times, and has a smaller attack surface. In addition,
the image is customized in order to improve the experience of running `tbot` in a
container environment.

[Deploying Machine ID on Kubernetes](../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/deployment/kubernetes.mdx)
guide.

## Running Teleport on Docker

When running a container from one of the images listed above, consider the
container equivalent to running the `teleport` binary. The Teleport container
requires access to a file system and network ports.

### Configuration

Teleport processes read their configuration from a local file path, which is
`/etc/teleport.yaml` by default. Make sure this file path is mounted to your
Teleport container.

### Data directory

All Teleport processes read from and write to a data directory, which by default
is `/var/lib/teleport`. Make sure the data directory is mounted to your Teleport
container.

### License file

If your Teleport Enterprise container runs the Auth Service, you will need to
give it access to a license file at the path named in the configuration, which
is `/var/lib/teleport/license.pem` by default. Make sure a license exists at
this location in the Teleport container's data directory.

### Other file paths

Depending on the configuration settings you assign on your Teleport container,
you will need to make sure that any file paths you name are mounted on the
container.

For example, if you are running the Teleport Proxy Service on a container, you
need to mount the directory containing TLS credentials to your Teleport
container, then assign the following fields in the container's configuration
file to the appropriate paths:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: /my/path/key.pem
    cert_file: /my/path/cert.pem
```

See the Teleport [Configuration Reference](../reference/deployment/config.mdx) for whether a
field you would like to assign requires a file path.

### Ports

A single Teleport process can run multiple services, each of which listens on a
specific set of ports depending on your configuration. See our [Networking
Reference](../reference/deployment/networking.mdx#ports) for the ports on your Teleport
container to expose.

### Extracting certificates from distroless images

Extracting certificates created with `tctl auth sign` from a container running
a distroless image can be tricky due to the absence of a shell and other OS tools.

Where possible you should log into the Teleport cluster using `tsh` and use
`tctl auth sign` locally to generate certificates. This way the action will be
logged against your Teleport user and be subject to all of the usual Teleport
RBAC policies in your cluster.

If this is not possible, use `tctl auth sign --tar` to collect all the files
generated by `tctl auth sign` into a `tar` archive, which is streamed directly
to `stdout`. The resulting certificates are never stored on the container
filesystem. You can either pipe this output directly to `tar`, or redirect it
to a local file for later use.

For example:

```code
$ docker exec ${TELEPORT_CONTAINER} \
  tctl auth sign --user alice --format tls -o alice.local --tar | tar xv
x alice.local.crt
x alice.local.key
x alice.local.cas
```

## Example of running a Teleport container

In this example, we will show you how to run the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy
Service on a local Docker container using Teleport Community Edition.

Since this container uses a self-signed certificate, we do not recommend using
this configuration to protect any infrastructure outside your workstation. You
can, however, join other local Docker containers to it using the [token
method](../enroll-resources/agents/join-token.mdx).

First, create directories in your home directory to mount to the container. The
Teleport container will write its configuration and data to these directories:

```code
$ mkdir -p ~/teleport/config ~/teleport/data
```

Run `teleport configure` from the Teleport container to generate a configuration
file. This sets the container's name to `localhost` so your browser can trust
the Proxy Service's self-signed TLS certificate:

```code
$ docker run --hostname localhost --rm \
  --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/teleport \
  <Var name="(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)" /> configure --roles=proxy,auth > ~/teleport/config/teleport.yaml
```

Start Teleport on your container:

```code
$ docker run --hostname localhost --name teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/data:/var/lib/teleport \
  -p 3025:3025 -p 3080:3080 \
  <Var name="(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)" />
```

From there, open another terminal and make sure your Teleport container's web
API is functioning as intended:

```code
$ curl --insecure https://localhost:3080/webapi/ping
```

You should see JSON output similar to the following:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "local",
    "second_factor": "otp",
    "preferred_local_mfa": "otp",
    "local": {
      "name": ""
    },
    "private_key_policy": "none",
    "device_trust_disabled": true,
    "has_motd": false
  },
  "proxy": {
    "kube": {
      "enabled": true,
      "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "ssh": {
      "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "tunnel_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "web_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "db": {
      "postgres_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "mysql_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "tls_routing_enabled": true
  },
  "server_version": "12.1.5",
  "min_client_version": "11.0.0",
  "cluster_name": "localhost",
  "automatic_upgrades": false
}
```

We are using the `--insecure` flag to trust Teleport's self-signed certificate.
In production, you will want to provision TLS credentials to the Proxy Service
from a trusted CA, e.g., Let's Encrypt.

## Upgrading Teleport on Docker

To upgrade a Teleport container running on Docker:

1. Leave the container's data directory in place.
1. Stop the container.
1. Run a new container with an image based on a newer Teleport version, mounting
   the data directory as you did while running the container initially. As long
   as the data directory contains the same content as before the upgrade, the
   Teleport container does not need to re-join the cluster.
