Whether you are installing Teleport as a cluster or as an agent that talks to the cluster, the Teleport binary is the same. The difference is only in how you [configure it](../reference/deployment/config.mdx), which you will need to do after installation. Before choosing an installation method below, you should identify your particular use case. There are three:

1. **Installing Teleport as a cluster:** Install a self-hosted Teleport cluster to provide secure, identity-based access to all your infrastructure. If you are running Teleport Enterprise Cloud, you will not need this use case, as the cluster is managed for you.
2. **Installing Teleport as an agent:** Install a Teleport Agent on your infrastructure resource to enroll it with your cluster for centralized access management.
3. **Installing Teleport as a client:** For interacting with and managing your clusters via CLI and Teleport Connect.

These use cases will be addressed in each platform page.

## Checksums

If you want to verify the integrity of a Teleport binary, SHA256 checksums are
available for all downloads on our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/download/).

![Teleport Checksum](../../img/teleport-sha.png)

If you download Teleport via an automated system, you can programmatically
obtain the checksum by adding `.sha256` to the download link. This is the method
shown in the installation examples.

```code
$ export version=v(=teleport.version=)
# 'darwin' 'linux' or 'windows'
$ export os=linux
# '386' 'arm' on linux or 'amd64' for all distros
$ export arch=amd64
$ curl https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-$version-$os-$arch-bin.tar.gz.sha256
# <checksum> <filename>
```

## Uninstalling Teleport

If you wish to uninstall Teleport at any time, see our documentation on [Uninstalling Teleport](../zero-trust-access/management/admin/uninstall-teleport.mdx).

## Next steps

Now that you know how to install Teleport, you can enable access to all of your
infrastructure. Get started with enrolling resources in your Teleport cluster:

- [SSH servers](../enroll-resources/server-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Databases](../enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx)
- [Applications](../enroll-resources/application-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Remote desktops](../enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Machine ID](../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/introduction.mdx)
