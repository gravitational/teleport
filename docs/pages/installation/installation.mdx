This guide shows you how to install Teleport binaries on your platform,
including:
- `teleport`
- `teleport-update`
- `tsh`
- `tctl`
- `tbot`
- `fdpass-teleport`

If you are new to Teleport, we recommend following our [getting started
guide](../get-started.mdx).

For best results, Teleport clients (`tsh`, `tctl`, `tbot`) should be the same major
version as the cluster they are connecting to. Teleport servers are compatible
with clients that are on the same major version or one major version older.
Teleport servers do not support clients that are on a newer major version.

See our [Upgrading](../upgrading/upgrading.mdx) guide for more information.


## Operating system support

Teleport is officially supported on the platforms listed below. It is worth
noting that the open-source community has been successful in building and
running Teleport on UNIX variants other than Linux \[1].

| Operating System | `teleport` Daemon | `tctl` Admin Tool | `tsh` and Teleport Connect User Clients [2] | Web UI (via the browser) | `tbot` Daemon |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Linux v2.6.23+ (RHEL/CentOS 7+, Rocky Linux 8+, Amazon Linux 2+, Amazon Linux 2023+, Ubuntu 16.04+, Debian 9+, SLES 12 SP 5+, and SLES 15 SP 5+) \[3] | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| macOS 11+  (Big Sur)| yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Windows 10+ (rev. 1607) \[4] | no | yes | yes | yes | yes |

\[1] *Teleport is written in Go and many of these system requirements are due to the requirements
of the [Go toolchain](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MinimumRequirements)*.

\[2] *`tsh` is a Command Line Client (CLI) and Teleport Connect is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) desktop client. See
  [Using Teleport Connect](../connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx) for usage and installation*.

\[3] *Enhanced Session Recording requires Linux kernel v5.8+*.

\[4] *Teleport server does not run on Windows yet, but `tsh`, `tbot`, `tctl`, and Teleport Connect (the Teleport desktop clients)
support most features on Windows 10 and later.*

## Start Here - Use Cases

Whether you are installing Teleport as a cluster or as an agent that talks to the cluster, the Teleport binary is the same. The difference is only in how you [configure it](../reference/config.mdx), which you will need to do after installation.

Before choosing an installation method below, you should identify your particular use case. There are three:

1. **Installing Teleport as a Cluster:** If you are running Teleport Enterprise Cloud, you will not need this use case. Otherwise, you can see our [self-hosted demo cluster guide](../admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx) for a walkthrough including a configuration example.
2. **Installing Teleport as an Agent:** There are guided instructions in the Teleport Web UI itself at `/web/discover`, or you can follow our [detailed docs pages](../enroll-resources/) on how to deploy the various Teleport agents to enroll resources.
3. **Installing Teleport CLI tooling:** For interacting with and managing your clusters via CLI.

The use cases will be addressed in each platform page.

## Checksums

If you want to verify the integrity of a Teleport binary, SHA256 checksums are
available for all downloads on our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/download/).

![Teleport Checksum](../../img/teleport-sha.png)

If you download Teleport via an automated system, you can programmatically
obtain the checksum by adding `.sha256` to the download link. This is the method
shown in the installation examples.

```code
$ export version=v(=teleport.version=)
# 'darwin' 'linux' or 'windows'
$ export os=linux
# '386' 'arm' on linux or 'amd64' for all distros
$ export arch=amd64
$ curl https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-$version-$os-$arch-bin.tar.gz.sha256
# <checksum> <filename>
```

## Uninstalling Teleport

If you wish to uninstall Teleport at any time, see our documentation on [Uninstalling Teleport](../admin-guides/management/admin/uninstall-teleport.mdx).

## Next steps

Now that you know how to install Teleport, you can enable access to all of your
infrastructure. Get started with enrolling resources in your Teleport cluster:

- [SSH servers](../enroll-resources/server-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Databases](../enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx)
- [Applications](../enroll-resources/application-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Remote desktops](../enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Machine ID](../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/introduction.mdx)
