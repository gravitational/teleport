Teleport maintains DEB and RPM package repositories for different operating
systems, platforms, and Teleport versions. A server that installs Teleport from
a DEB or RPM package must have systemd installed. You can also download TAR
archives containing Teleport binaries.

Note that Teleport Agents should always use the one-line installation script
or `teleport-update` binary to install Teleport. Otherwise, they will fall
out-of-date, become incompatible with the cluster, and eventually disconnect.

## Operating system support

| Operating System | `teleport` Daemon | `tctl` Admin Tool | `tsh` and Teleport Connect User Clients [1] | Web UI (via the browser) | `tbot` Daemon |

## Installing Teleport as a cluster

These steps are specifically for the Teleport Enterprise (Self-Hosted) and Community Edition versions.

If you are starting out with Teleport, we recommend beginning with a [Teleport Cloud](https://goteleport.com/signup/) account. From there, the only Teleport components you need to deploy yourself are Teleport Agents, which is discussed in the [next section](#installing-teleport-as-an-agent).
If you are self-hosting a Teleport cluster, please take a look at our [Linux Demo](../get-started/deploy-community.mdx) for the Teleport Community Edition or our [Self-Hosting Teleport](../zero-trust-access/deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx) section in the docs for more information on Teleport Enterprise Self-Hosted.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Teleport Enterprise (Self-Hosted)">
```code
$ TELEPORT_EDITION="enterprise"
$ TELEPORT_VERSION="(=teleport.version=)"
```

Then, download and run the generic installation script on the server where you
want to install Teleport:
```code
$ curl (=teleport.teleport_install_script_url=) | bash -s ${TELEPORT_VERSION?} ${TELEPORT_EDITION?}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Community Edition">
```code
$ TELEPORT_EDITION="oss"
$ TELEPORT_VERSION="(=teleport.version=)"
```

Then, download and run the generic installation script on the server where you
want to install Teleport:
```code
$ curl (=teleport.teleport_install_script_url=) | bash -s ${TELEPORT_VERSION?} ${TELEPORT_EDITION?}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify cluster installation

Run the following command to verify your installation:
```code
$ teleport version
```

You should see output displaying the Teleport version number.

<Checkpoint
  title="Troubleshoot cluster installation issues"
  description="Success looks like: The system identifies the Teleport binary and returns a valid version number."
>

- If `teleport` is not found, the binary may not be in your PATH. For package installs, it should be in `/usr/bin/`. For TAR installs, check `/usr/local/bin/` and ensure it's in your PATH.
- If the installation script failed, ensure the host has outbound internet access to download packages.
- If the service fails to start:
  ```code
  $ sudo systemctl start teleport
  $ sudo systemctl status teleport
  ```
  **Note**: `systemctl status` will only show a service after you have created a configuration file at `/etc/teleport.yaml`.  
- Check logs for startup errors:
  ```code
  $ sudo journalctl -u teleport --no-pager -n 50
  ```
- If systemd is not available on your system, use a [TAR archive installation](#downloading-packages-and-tar-archives) instead.

</Checkpoint>

### Cluster configuration

The above methods for installing Teleport on a Linux server do not generate a Teleport configuration file for you. For this, we have a `teleport configure` CLI command or you can create one manually.

See the following guides for help setting up a configuration file:

- [Teleport Configuration Reference](../reference/deployment/config.mdx): This will provide you with the command you need to generate and populate the `/etc/config.yaml` file as well as further configuration options for your cluster.
- [Self-Hosted Demo Cluster](../zero-trust-access/deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx): If you are deploying the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service, read this guide for an example of a configuration file.

## Installing Teleport as an agent

The easiest way to install Teleport as an agent is through the Web UI at `/web/discover`, where you can select a resource to enroll with your Teleport cluster and retrieve an "all-in-one" installation script to run on Linux hosts.

### One-line installation script

Outside of the Web UI, you can run our one-line cluster install script on your Linux server where you are deploying Teleport as an agent. This script will detect and use the best version, edition, and installation mode for your cluster.

1. Assign <Var name="example.teleport.sh:443"/> to your Teleport cluster hostname and Web UI port.
   This should contain your cluster hostname and port, but not the scheme (https://).
1. Run your cluster's install script:
```code
$ curl "https://<Var name="example.teleport.sh:443"/>/scripts/install.sh" | sudo bash
```

You can also use the example Terraform module for deploying agents in [Deploy
Agents with
Terraform](../zero-trust-access/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-getting-started.mdx).

### Verify agent installation

Run the following commands to verify your agent installation:
```code
$ teleport version
$ sudo systemctl status teleport
```

You should see the Teleport version and a status showing the service is active and running.

<Checkpoint
  title="Troubleshoot agent installation issues"
  description="Success looks like: The Teleport version is displayed and the service status is reported as active and running."
>

- If the service is not running, start it and check status:
  ```code
  $ sudo systemctl start teleport
  $ sudo systemctl status teleport
  ```
- To verify the agent is actually communicating with the cluster, 
  check the Servers in the Web UI or run this on the Auth server:
  ```code
  $ sudo tctl nodes ls
  ```
- Check logs for errors:
  ```code
  $ sudo journalctl -u teleport --no-pager -n 50
  ```
- Verify a configuration file exists at `/etc/teleport.yaml`. If missing, the service will fail to start with a meaningful error.
- If you see **"join token expired"** or **"token not found"** errors, generate a new join token from your cluster.
- If you see **"connection refused"** or **"timeout"** errors, ensure the agent can reach the Teleport Proxy Service. Check firewalls, security groups, and DNS resolution.
- If you see **"clock skew detected"** or certificate validity errors, synchronize system time:
  ```code
  $ timedatectl status
  $ sudo systemctl restart chronyd  # or systemd-timesyncd
  ```
- On SELinux-enabled systems, check for denied operations:
  ```code
  $ sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent
  ```
- If your environment uses outbound TLS inspection or proxies, ensure Teleport traffic to the Proxy Service is not intercepted.

</Checkpoint>

### Agent configuration

Outside of deploying Teleport as an agent in the Web UI, the methods for installing Teleport on a Linux server do not generate a Teleport configuration file for you. You will need to generate one prior to starting the Teleport service.

See the following guides for examples of setting up a configuration file:

- [Enroll Resources](../enroll-resources/enroll-resources.mdx): Guides to setting
  up Teleport Agents in order to enroll infrastructure resources in your cluster. These
  guides include examples of setting up Teleport configuration files.
- [Self-Hosted Demo
  Cluster](../zero-trust-access/deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx): If you are
  deploying the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service, read this guide for an
  example of a configuration file.
- [Teleport Configuration Reference](../reference/deployment/config.mdx): A guide to all
  configuration fields.

## Other install methods

### Package repositories

The [one-line installation script](#one-line-installation-script) automatically
detects a package manager on the local system and uses it to install Teleport
from an upstream repository.

If your system does not support the one-line installation script, read the
instructions in this section for working with Teleport package repositories.

Note that Teleport Agents should always use the one-line installation script
or `teleport-update` binary to install Teleport. Otherwise, they will fall
out-of-date, become incompatible with the cluster, and eventually disconnect.

#### Step 1: Set environment variables

Assign the following environment variables in the terminal where you will run
Teleport installation commands, indicating the package and version to install:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Teleport Enterprise (Self-Hosted)">
```code
$ export TELEPORT_PKG=teleport-ent
$ export TELEPORT_VERSION=v(=teleport.major_version=)
$ export TELEPORT_CHANNEL=stable/${TELEPORT_VERSION?}
```

For FedRAMP/FIPS-compliant installations, install the `teleport-ent-fips` package instead:
```code
$ export TELEPORT_PKG=teleport-ent-fips
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Community Edition">
```code
$ export TELEPORT_PKG=teleport
$ export TELEPORT_VERSION=v(=teleport.major_version=)
$ export TELEPORT_CHANNEL=stable/${TELEPORT_VERSION?}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Step 2: Source OS release variables

Teleport maintains DEB and RPM package repositories for different Linux
distributions based on variables defined in `/etc/os-release` on Linux
systems. Source this file to define the variables:
```code
$ source /etc/os-release
```

<Checkpoint
  title="Verify OS release variables"
  description="Success looks like: The output displays valid identifiers for your distribution and version."
>

- Run the following to confirm the variables are set:
  ```code
  $ echo "ID=$ID, VERSION_ID=$VERSION_ID, VERSION_CODENAME=$VERSION_CODENAME"
  ```
- If variables are empty, check that `/etc/os-release` exists and contains the expected fields.
- If `VERSION_CODENAME` is blank (common on RHEL/CentOS/AL2), ensure your installation command uses `VERSION_ID` instead to avoid "404 Not Found" repository errors.

</Checkpoint>

#### Step 3: Verify your distribution is supported

Make sure the value of the `ID` environment variable is supported.

The Teleport DEB and RPM repositories don't expose packages for all
distribution variants. When installing Teleport using RPM repositories, you
may need to replace the `ID` variable set in `/etc/os-release` with `ID_LIKE`
to install packages of the closest supported distribution.

Currently supported distributions (and `ID` values) are:

| Distribution | Version              | `ID` value in `/etc/os-release` |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Amazon Linux | 2 and 2023           | `amzn`                          |
| CentOS       | >= 7                 | `centos`                        |
| Debian       | >= 9                 | `debian`                        |
| RHEL         | >= 7                 | `rhel`                          |
| Rocky Linux  | >= 8                 | `rocky`                         |
| SLES         | >= 12 SP5, >= 15 SP5 | `sles`                          |
| Ubuntu       | >= 16.04             | `ubuntu`                        |

Note that [Enhanced Session
Recording](../enroll-resources/server-access/guides/bpf-session-recording.mdx) requires Linux
kernel version 5.8+. This means that it requires more recent OS versions than
other Teleport features:

| Distribution | Version                  |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Amazon Linux | 2 (post 11/2021), 2023   |
| CentOS/RHEL  | 9+                       |
| Rocky Linux  | 8+                       |
| Debian       | 11, or 10 with backports |
| Ubuntu       | 20.04+                   |

If the value of `ID` is not in the list above, look up the space-separated
values of the `ID_LIKE` variable you sourced from `/etc/os-release` and see
if one of them appears in the list.

#### Step 4: Install Teleport

Follow the instructions for your package manager:

<TabItem label="apt">
```code

### Verify package repository installation

Run the following command to verify your installation:
```code
$ teleport version
```

You should see output displaying the Teleport version number.

<Checkpoint
  title="Troubleshoot package repository installation issues"
  description="Success looks like: The package manager confirms the Teleport package is installed and the version command responds."
>

- If the package was not found, verify environment variables are set correctly:
  ```code
  $ echo "ID=$ID, VERSION_ID=$VERSION_ID, TELEPORT_PKG=$TELEPORT_PKG, TELEPORT_CHANNEL=$TELEPORT_CHANNEL"
  ```
- For apt-based systems, ensure the GPG key was downloaded to `/etc/apt/keyrings/teleport-archive-keyring.asc`.
- If you see **"repository not found"** or **"404"** errors, your distribution or version may not be supported. Check the [supported distributions table](#step-3-verify-your-distribution-is-supported) and try using `ID_LIKE` if available.
- Clear package manager cache and retry:
  ```code
  $ sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update  # Debian/Ubuntu
  $ sudo yum clean all && sudo yum makecache   # RHEL/CentOS
  $ sudo dnf clean all && sudo dnf makecache   # Fedora/RHEL 8+
  ```
- If `teleport` works but `sudo tctl` fails with "command not found", package installs place binaries in `/usr/bin/` which should already be in sudo's secure_path.

</Checkpoint>

### Downloading packages and TAR archives

Teleport maintains TAR archives as well as DEB and RPM packages for
Linux-compatible binaries at `https://cdn.teleport.dev`. This section explains
how to install Teleport by manually downloading a release.

Note that Teleport Agents should always use the one-line installation script
or `teleport-update` binary to install Teleport. Otherwise, they will fall
out-of-date, become incompatible with the cluster, and eventually disconnect.

#### Step 1: Set the package name

In your terminal, assign environment variables that you will use to download
your intended archive.

For Teleport Community Edition, the Teleport package is called `teleport`:
```code
$ TELEPORT_PKG=teleport
```

For self-hosted Teleport Enterprise deployments, the package is called
`teleport-ent`:
```code
$ TELEPORT_PKG=teleport-ent
```

#### Step 2: Set version and architecture

Specify your system Teleport version and system architecture by assigning an
environment variable:

```code
$ TELEPORT_VERSION=(=teleport.version=)
$ SYSTEM_ARCH=""
```

The following architecture values are available:

- `amd64` (`x86_64` if downloading an RPM package)
- `arm64`
- `arm`
- `386` (`i386` if downloading a DEB or RPM package)

<Checkpoint
  title="Verify system architecture"
  description="Success looks like: The system architecture is identified and mapped to a supported Teleport build type (x86_64, aarch64, armv7l, or i686)."
>

**Determine your system architecture:**

```code
$ uname -m
```
Map the output to the correct `SYSTEM_ARCH` value:

| `uname -m` output | `SYSTEM_ARCH` value | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| `x86_64` | `amd64` | Use `x86_64` for RPM packages |
| `aarch64` | `arm64` | |
| `armv7l` | `arm` | |
| `i686` | `386` | Use `i386` for DEB/RPM packages |

</Checkpoint>

#### Step 3: Download and install

Run the following commands to download a Teleport package or archive, unpack
it, and install binaries:

### Verify manual installation

Run the following command to verify your installation:
```code
$ teleport version
```

You should see output displaying the Teleport version number.

<Checkpoint
  title="Troubleshoot manual installation issues"
  description="Success looks like: The checksum is verified and Teleport is accessible from your system command path."
>

- If checksum verification fails (`shasum` reports mismatch), delete the downloaded files and re-download. 
  The file may have been corrupted or incompletely downloaded.
- If `teleport` is not found after TAR installation:
  - Ensure you ran the install script from the extracted directory: `sudo ./install`
  - Verify binaries exist in `/usr/local/bin/`:
    ```code
    $ ls -la /usr/local/bin/teleport /usr/local/bin/tctl /usr/local/bin/tsh
    ```
  - Add `/usr/local/bin` to your PATH if needed:
    ```code
    $ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
    ```
- If `sudo tctl` fails but `tctl` works, add `/usr/local/bin` to sudo's secure_path:
  ```code
  $ echo 'Defaults secure_path="/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin"' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/secure_path
  ```
- If the DEB/RPM install fails with dependency errors:
  ```code
  $ sudo apt-get install -f          # Debian/Ubuntu
  $ sudo yum localinstall <package>  # RHEL/CentOS
  $ sudo dnf localinstall <package>  # Fedora/RHEL 8+
  ```
- If systemd does not recognize the Teleport service after TAR install, reload unit files:
  ```code
  $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  ```
- Verify the package architecture matches your system:
  ```code
  $ uname -m
  $ file /usr/local/bin/teleport  # Should show matching architecture
  ```
