### Can I use Teleport Cloud in production?

Yes.

## What is the cloud SLA

Teleport Cloud commits to SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=)% of monthly uptime percentage,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month.

### How does Cloud Billing work?

[Reach out to sales](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise) to discuss pricing.

### Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?

We use AWS-managed keys. Currently there is no option to provide your own key.

### Is this Teleport's S3 bucket, or my bucket based on my AWS credentials?

It's a Teleport-managed S3 bucket with AWS-managed keys.
Currently there is no way to provide your own bucket.

### How do I add nodes to Teleport Cloud?

You can connect servers, kubernetes clusters, databases and applications
using [reverse tunnels](../admin-guide.mdx#adding-a-node-located-behind-nat).

There is no need to open any ports on your infrastructure for inbound traffic.

### How can I access the tctl admin tool?

We have made changes to allow you to log into your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl` remotely:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh
$ tctl status
```

You must use the enterprise version of `tctl`.

### Why am I getting `permission denied` errors when using `tctl`?

If you have a local file `/etc/teleport.yaml` on your machine `tctl` will attempt to use the local cluster. Set the environment variable `TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE` to `""` so it will not attempt to use that Teleport configuration file.

```code
$ export TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE=""
$ tctl tokens add --type=node
```

### Are dynamic node tokens available?

After [connecting](#how-can-i-access-the-tctl-admin-tool) `tctl` to Teleport Cloud, users can generate
[dynamic tokens](../admin-guide.mdx#short-lived-dynamic-tokens):

```code
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node,proxy --token=$(uuid)
```

### When will a security audit be available?

Security audit has been completed and is available [here](https://goteleport.com/resources/audits/teleport-cloud-security-audit-2021/).

### What does Teleport Cloud run in?

Teleport Cloud is deployed using a [Gravity](https://github.com/gravitational/gravity)
cluster on AWS.

### Will Teleport be automatically upgraded with each release?

We will be upgrading the preview version of Teleport Cloud automatically.

### Does your SOCII report include Teleport Cloud?

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

### Can a customer deploy multiple clusters in Teleport Cloud?

Not at this time.

### Is FIPS mode an option?

FIPS is not currently an option for Teleport Cloud clusters.

### How do you store passwords?

Password hashes are generated using
[Golang's bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).

### How does Teleport manage web certificates? Can I upload my own?

Teleport uses [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) to issue
certificates for every customer. It is not possible to upload a custom
certificate or use a custom domain name.

### Do you encrypt data at rest?

Each deployment is using at-rest encryption using AWS DynamoDB and S3 at-rest encryption
for customer data including session recordings and user records.
