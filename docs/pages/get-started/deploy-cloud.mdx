Teleport Enterprise Cloud is the **fastest and easiest way to get started**.  

Infrastructure and certificates are managed for you. All that's left is deploying agents to enroll your resources.

To get started, simply sign up for a 14-day free trial. We'll automatically provision and manage a fully featured Teleport cluster in a dedicated tenant with a unique `example.teleport.sh` domain.

**To deploy your cluster:**

1. Go to [goteleport.com/signup](https://goteleport.com/signup)
2. Follow the sign-up steps to launch your cluster

When setup is finished, you'll have a production-grade Teleport cluster configured with secure defaults, automatic updates, and built-in scalability.

## Next step: Connect infrastructure

At this point, you've launched your own Teleport Enterprise Cloud cluster and created a user in the process. You can now move on to the next step of connecting your infrastructure.
