title: Set up Automatic Agent Upgrades
description: Describes how to set up automatic agent upgrades for self-hosted Teleport deployments.
---

Teleport supports automatic agent upgrades for systemd-based Linux distributions
using `apt`, `yum`, and `zypper` package managers, as well as Kubernetes
clusters. 

Teleport agents run an **upgrader** that queries a **version server** to
determine whether they are out of date. This guide describes how to set up your
infrastructure to support automatic updates. If you are a Teleport Cloud user
or run a version server already, return to the [Upgrading](../upgrading.mdx)
menu for the appropriate next steps to upgrade Teleport.

The [Automatic Update Architecture](../architecture/agent-update-management.mdx)
guide explains how automatic agent upgrades work in more detail.

<Admonition type="warning">
Systemd agents enrolled into automatic updates can only install versions
present in their package repositories. As Teleport 14 won't be published to
`stable/v13`, those agents will require manual intervention to be upgraded to
the next major version (adding a new APT/YUM/zypper repo for `stable/v14`).
Alternatively, you can use the `stable/rolling` channel, which contains
Teleport v13.3.2 forward, including future major releases.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./overview.mdx) guide,
  which describes the sequence in which to upgrade components of your cluster.
- Self-hosted Teleport cluster running at least v14.3.7 or v15.1.3. 
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl-tsh-prerequisite.mdx!)
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Check the version advertised by the Teleport Proxy Service

The Teleport Proxy service exposes by default a version channel called `default`
that serves the same version the Proxy Service is running.

If your proxy public address is <Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />, you can
query the version server with the following command:

```code
$ curl "https://<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />/v1/webapi/automaticupgrades/channel/default/version"
(=teleport.version=)
```

<Details title="Changing which version is served by the version server">

By default, the version server has a single `default` channel, serving the
version of the Teleport Proxy Service. If you want to override the default version or add other channels you
can use the `automatic_upgrades_channels` field in the Proxy Service configuration file:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  automatic_upgrades_channels:
    # Override the default version channel reachable at
    # https://<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />/v1/webapi/automaticupgrades/channel/default/version
    default:
      static_version: v14.2.1
    # Define a new version channel with a static version reachable at
    # https://<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />/v1/webapi/automaticupgrades/channel/m-static-channel/version
    my-static-channel:
      static_version: v14.2.0
    # Define a new version channel forwarding requests to an upstream version server
    my-remote-channel:
      forward_url: https://updates.releases.teleport.dev/v1/stable/cloud
```

You must ensure all proxies share the same `automatic_upgrades_channels`
configuration. If Proxy Service instances are configured differently, you will experience agents
flickering between versions as the version served is not consistent across
instances.

## Step 2/4. Configure the maintenance schedule

At this point, the updaters can be configured to pull the version from the
release channel and upgrade the agents. In this step you'll configure a
maintenance schedule for the Teleport cluster that agents will use to determine
when to check for upgrades.

### Create a Teleport role

Create a Teleport role that can manage cluster maintenance configurations
through the `cluster_maintenance_config` dynamic resource. No preset Teleport
roles provide this ability, so you will need to create one.

1. Create a file called `cmc-editor.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   version: v7
   metadata:
     name: cmc-editor
   spec:
     allow:
       rules:
       - resources: ['cluster_maintenance_config']
         verbs: ['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete']
   ```

1. Create the role resource:

   ```code
   $ tctl create cmd-editor.yaml
   ```

1. Add the role to your Teleport user:

  (!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx!)

### Create a cluster maintenance configuration

Create the following `cmc.yaml` manifest allowing maintenance on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday between 02:00 and 03:00 UTC.

(!docs/pages/includes/cluster-maintenance-config-spec.mdx!)

Finally, apply the manifest using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create cmc.yaml
maintenance window has been updated
```

## Step 3/4. Enroll Kubernetes agents in automatic updates

Now that you have deployed a version server, you can enroll agents in automatic
upgrades. This guide begins with agents deployed on Kubernetes. If all of your
agents run on Linux servers, you can skip to [Step
4](#step-44-enroll-linux-agents-in-automatic-updates).

### Install the agent upgrader Helm chart

This section assumes that the name of your `teleport-kube-agent` release is
`teleport-agent`, and that you have installed it in the `teleport` namespace.

1. Add the following chart values to the values file for the
   `teleport-kube-agent` chart:

   ```yaml
   updater:
     enabled: true
     # No need to set the `versionServer` value anymore since v13.4.15, v14.3.1 and v15.
     releaseChannel: default
   ```

1. Update the Helm chart release with the new values:

   ```code
   $ helm -n <Var name="teleport" />  upgrade <Var name="teleport-agent" /> teleport/teleport-kube-agent \
   --values=values.yaml \
   --version=<Var name="(=teleport.version=)" />
   ```

### Verify that the upgrader is working properly

1. You can validate the updater is running properly by checking if its pod is
   ready:

   ```code
   $ kubectl -n teleport-agent get pods
   NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   <your-agent-release>-0                         1/1     Running   0          14m
   <your-agent-release>-1                         1/1     Running   0          14m
   <your-agent-release>-2                         1/1     Running   0          14m
   <your-agent-release>-updater-d9f97f5dd-v57g9   1/1     Running   0          16m
   ```
   
1. Check for any deployment issues by checking the updater logs:
   
    ```code
    $ kubectl -n <Var name="teleport" /> logs deployment/<Var name="teleport-agent" />-updater
    2023-04-28T13:13:30Z	INFO	StatefulSet is already up-to-date, not updating.	{"controller": "statefulset", "controllerGroup": "apps", "controllerKind": "StatefulSet", "StatefulSet": {"name":"my-agent","namespace":"agent"}, "namespace": "agent", "name": "my-agent", "reconcileID": "10419f20-a4c9-45d4-a16f-406866b7fc05", "namespacedname": "agent/my-agent", "kind": "StatefulSet", "err": "no new version (current: \"v12.2.3\", next: \"v12.2.3\")"}
    ```

### Troubleshooting automatic agent upgrades on Kubernetes

The updater is a controller that periodically reconciles expected Kubernetes
resources with those in the cluster. The updater executes a reconciliation loop
every 30 minutes or in response to a Kubernetes event. If you don't want to wait
until the next reconciliation, you can trigger an event. 

1. Any deployment update will send an event, so you can trigger the upgrader by
   annotating the resource:

   ```code
   $ kubectl -n <Var name="teleport" /> annotate statefulset/<Var name="teleport-agent" /> 'debug.teleport.dev/trigger-event=1'
   ```

1. To suspend automatic updates for an agent, annotate the agent deployment
   with `teleport.dev/skipreconcile: "true"`, either by setting the
   `annotations.deployment` value in Helm, or by patching the deployment
   directly with `kubectl`.

## Step 4/4. Enroll Linux agents in automatic updates

This section shows you how to enroll Teleport agents running on Linux virtual or
bare-metal machines into automatic updates.

Follow these instructions on each of your Teleport agents.

### Install the agent upgrader

1. Ensure the Teleport repository is added and Teleport Enterprise is installed.

   To verify if the Teleport repository was added to the system, check if either of the follow files exist:

   ```code
   $ ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/teleport.list
   # or
   $ ls /etc/yum.repos.d/teleport.repo
   ```

   The upgrader checks the repository for available releases, so make sure that
   it is up to date.
   
1. If the repository was added, make sure the Teleport binary installed on the
   agent can run the automatic updater:

   ```code
   $ which teleport-upgrade || echo "Install the upgrader"
   Install the upgrader
   ```

1. If the Teleport repository is not found, or the Teleport binary you installed
   does not include the upgrader, add the appropriate repository and reinstall
   Teleport.
   
   (!docs/pages/includes/install-linux-ent-self-hosted.mdx to-install="teleport-ent-updater" !)

### Configure the upgrader

1. Create the upgrade configuration directory:
   
   ```code
   $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/
   ```
   
1. If you changed the agent user to run as non-root, create
   `/etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule` and grant ownership to your Teleport user.
   Otherwise, you can skip this step:
   
   ```code
   $ sudo touch /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
   $ sudo chown <Var name="your-teleport-user" /> /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
   ```
   
1. Configure the upgrader to connect to your custom version server and subscribe
   to the right release channel:
   
   ```code
   $ echo "<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />/v1/webapi/automaticupgrades/channel/default" | sudo tee /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/endpoint
   ```

   Make sure not to include `https://` as a prefix to the server address, nor
   suffix the endpoint with `/version`.

### Verify that the upgrader is working properly

1. Verify that the upgrader can see your version endpoint by checking for
   upgrades:

   ```code
   $ sudo teleport-upgrade dry-run
   ```
   
1. You should see one of the following messages, depending on the target version
   you are currently serving:
    
   ```text
   no upgrades available (1.2.3 == 1.2.3)
   an upgrade is available (1.2.3 -> 2.3.4)
   ```
    
   `teleport-upgrade` may display warnings about not having a valid upgrade
   schedule. This is expected immediately after install as the maintenance
   schedule might not be exported yet.

### Troubleshooting automatic agent upgrades on Linux

1. If an agent is not automatically upgraded, you can invoke the upgrader
   manually and look at its logs:

   ```code
   $ sudo teleport-upgrade run
   ```

1. To suspend automatic updates, disable the systemd timer:

   ```code
   $ sudo systemctl disable --now teleport-upgrade.timer
   ```

1. To enable and start the systemd timer after suspending:

   ```code
   $ sudo systemctl enable --now teleport-upgrade.timer
   ```

## Next steps

While this guide showed you how to apply a `cluster_maintenance_config` resource
using `tctl`, we recommend using infrastructure as code to maintain your
Teleport resources. See the
[`teleport_cluster_maintenance_config`](../reference/terraform-provider.mdx#teleport_cluster_maintenance_config)
for how to declare a cluster maintenance configuration with Terraform.
