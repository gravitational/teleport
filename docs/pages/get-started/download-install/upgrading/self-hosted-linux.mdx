title: Upgrade Self-Hosted Teleport Clusters on Linux
description: Provides instructions for upgrading self-hosted Teleport clusters that run on Linux servers.

This guide explains how to upgrade self-hosted Teleport clusters running on
Linux servers.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./overview.mdx) guide,
  which describes the sequence in which to upgrade components of your cluster.

- A self-hosted Teleport cluster in which the Auth Service and Proxy Service run
  on Linux servers.

  If you are running more than one Auth Service instance, you must reduce the
  size of the Auth Service instance pool to one in order to perform an upgrade.

## Upgrade Teleport binaries

Complete the following steps on all servers that run the Auth Service and Proxy
Service, then on each of your agents:

1. Install the latest Teleport version on the host.

   (!docs/pages/includes/install-linux-self-hosted.mdx!)

1. Confirm that the version of the `teleport` binary is the one you expect:

   ```code
   $ teleport version
   ```

1. Now that you have installed a more recent `teleport` binary on your Auth
   Service and Proxy Service servers, restart Teleport on these servers to run
   the new version.
