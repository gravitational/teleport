title: Upgrading Compatibility Overview
description: Provides a high-level description of how to upgrade the components in your Teleport cluster. Read this guide before following upgrade instructions for your environment.

Since Teleport is a distributed system with a number of services that run on
potentially many hosts, you should take care when upgrading the cluster to
ensure that all components remain compatible.

This guide provides an overview of how to upgrade the components in your
Teleport cluster while preserving compatibility.

## Component compatibility

(!docs/pages/includes/compatibility.mdx!)

In Teleport Enterprise Cloud, we manage the Auth and Proxy Services for you. You
can determine the current version of these services by running the following
command, where `mytenant` is the name of your Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant:

```code
$ curl -s https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.server_version'
```

## Upgrading a self-hosted Teleport cluster

Because of the component compatibility guarantees we described in the previous
section, you must adhere to the following sequence when upgrading a self-hosted
Teleport cluster:

1. Back up your Teleport cluster state as a precaution against any unforeseen
   incidents while upgrading the Auth Service, which may perform data
   migrations on its backend. Follow the instructions in [Backup and
   Restore](../management/operations/backup-restore.mdx).

1. If several Auth Service instances are running in a high availability
   configuration (for example, in an AWS Auto Scaling group), you must shrink
   the group to **just one Auth Service** before performing an upgrade.

1. Upgrade the **Auth Service** to the next **major version first**. If there
   are data format changes introduced in the new version, the Auth Service
   performs the necessary migrations.  After the upgrade, start the Auth Service
   and CONFIRM that it's in a healthy state before continuing.

1. Upgrade Proxy Service instances to the same version number as the Auth
   Service. Proxy Service instances are stateless and can be upgraded in any
   sequence or at the same time.

1. Upgrade your Teleport agents to the same version number as the Auth Service.
   You can upgrade resource agents in any sequence or at the same time.
   
   If you are upgrading more then one version number, repeat these steps until
   you reach your target major version number.

## Upgrading multiple Teleport clusters

When upgrading multiple Teleport clusters with a trust relationship, you must
upgrade in the following sequence to avoid compatibility issues. 

You must upgrade all clusters one major version at a time. For example, if you
would like to upgrade your clusters from v10 to v12, you must follow the
sequence below to upgrade clusters from v10 to v11, then repeat the sequence to
upgrade from v10 to v11.

1. Upgrade the root cluster—that is, the cluster that other clusters
   trust—first.
1. Verify the upgrade was successful.
1. Upgrade the trusted leaf clusters.
