Teleport is an identity-based access platform that secures servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases, internal applications, and desktops using short-lived certificates, detailed audit logging, and fine-grained role-based access controls tied to your SSO provider (e.g., Okta, GitHub, Google Workspace).

This guide walks you through four essential steps to get you up and running.

## Choose your Teleport edition

There are several editions of Teleport that differ in their feature sets, deployment options, and support.

Before choosing one, ask yourself:

- Am I looking to evaluate Teleport quickly or explore the full feature set without provisioning infrastructure? → **Enterprise Cloud**
- Do I need to deploy and manage Teleport in my own environment for compliance reasons? → **Enterprise Self-Hosted**
- Do I prefer to self-host Teleport locally to test features or use it for free? → **Community Edition**
