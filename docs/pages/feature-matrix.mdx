The **Teleport Identity Infrastructure Platform** modernizes identity, access,
and policy for infrastructure, for both human and non-human identities. Products
include:

- [Teleport Zero Trust Access](#teleport-zero-trust-access)
- [Teleport Machine & Workload Identity](#teleport-machine--workload-identity)
- [Teleport Identity Governance](#teleport-identity-governance)
- [Teleport Identity Security](#teleport-identity-security)

## Teleport Zero Trust Access

**Teleport Zero Trust Access** provides engineers with least privileged access
to applications, servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, and other resources
across distributed infrastructures.

**User identity:** Authenticate users without passwords leveraging Touch ID,
YubiKey Bio and other biometric devices. Add Teleport as a security layer on top
of your identity provider or use Teleport's SSO.
