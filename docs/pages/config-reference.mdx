## teleport.yaml

Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A full configuration reference
file is shown below, this provides comments and all available options for `teleport.yaml`
By default, it is stored in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

```yaml
# By default, this file should be stored in /etc/teleport.yaml

# This section of the configuration file applies to all teleport
# services.
teleport:
    # nodename allows to assign an alternative name this node can be reached by.
    # by default it's equal to hostname
    nodename: graviton

    # Data directory where Teleport daemon keeps its data.
    # See "Filesystem Layout" for more details
    # (https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#filesystem-layout).
    data_dir: /var/lib/teleport

    # Invitation token used to join a cluster. it is not used on
    # subsequent starts
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # Optional CA pin of the auth server. This enables more secure way of adding new
    # nodes to a cluster. See "Adding Nodes to the Cluster"
    # (https://goteleport.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#adding-nodes-to-the-cluster).
    ca_pin: "sha256:7e12c17c20d9cb504bbcb3f0236be3f446861f1396dcbb44425fe28ec1c108f1"

    # When running in multi-homed or NATed environments Teleport nodes need
    # to know which IP it will be reachable at by other nodes
    #
    # This value can be specified as FQDN e.g. host.example.com
    advertise_ip: 10.1.0.5

    # list of auth servers in a cluster. you will have more than one auth server
    # if you configure teleport auth to run in HA configuration.
    # If adding a node located behind NAT, use the Proxy URL. e.g.
    #  auth_servers:
    #     - teleport-proxy.example.com:3080
    auth_servers:
        - 10.1.0.5:3025
        - 10.1.0.6:3025

    # Teleport throttles all connections to avoid abuse. These settings allow
    # you to adjust the default limits
    connection_limits:
        max_connections: 1000
        max_users: 250

    # Logging configuration. Possible output values to disk via '/var/lib/teleport/teleport.log',
    # 'stdout', 'stderr' and 'syslog'. Possible severity values are INFO, WARN
    # and ERROR (default). Possible format values include: timestamp, component, caller, and level.

    # to learn how to configure DynamoDB, S3, etcd and other highly available back-ends.
