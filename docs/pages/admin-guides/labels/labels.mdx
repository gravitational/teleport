title: Add Labels to Resources
description: How to assign static and command-based dynamic labels to Teleport resources.
---

Teleport allows you to add arbitrary key-value pairs to applications, servers,
databases, and other resources in your cluster. You can use labels to do 
the following:

- Filter the resources returned when running `tctl` and `tsh` commands.
- Define roles that limit the resources Teleport users can access.

This guide demonstrates how to add labels to enrolled server resources.
However, you can follow similar steps to add labels to other types of resources.

## Static, dynamic, and resource-based labels

The labels you assign to resources can be **static labels**, **dynamic labels**, or **resource-based labels**.

- Static labels are hardcoded in the Teleport configuration file and don't change 
while the `teleport` process is running. For example, you might use a static label to identify 
the resources in a `staging` or `production` environment.
- Dynamic labels—also known as **commands-based labels**—allow you to generate labels at runtime. 
With a dynamic label, the `teleport` process executes an external command on its host at 
a configurable frequency and the output of the command becomes the label value.
- Resource-based labels allow you to add labels to an instance without restarting the `teleport`
process or editing the configuration file.

You can add multiple static, dynamic, and resource-based labels for the same resource.
However, you can't add static labels that use the same key with different values or use
a static label to define multiple potential values.

Dynamic labels are especially useful for decoupling a label value from the Teleport configuration. 
For example, if you start Teleport on an Amazon EC2 instance, you can use a dynamic label to set the 
`region` value based on the result from a command sent to the EC2 instance 
[metadata API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-categories.html).
The dynamic label enables you to use the same configuration for each server in an Amazon Machine Image 
but filter and limit access to the servers based on their AWS region.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/2. Install Teleport

1. Select a host for running the Teleport agent.

1. (!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

1. Generate an invitation token for the host.
   
   The invitation token is required for the local computer to join the Teleport cluster.  
   The following example generates a new token that is valid for five minutes and can be used 
   to enroll a server:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl tokens add --ttl=5m --type=node
   # The invite token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
   ```

1. List all generated non-expired tokens by running the following command:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl tokens ls
   # Token                            Type        Labels Expiry Time (UTC)               
   # -------------------------------- ----------- ------ ------------------------------- 
   # (=presets.tokens.first=) Node,Db,App        10 Aug 23 19:49 UTC (4m11s) 
   ```

1. Copy the token and assign it to an environment variable on the computer you are enrolling 
as a resource:
   
   ```code
   $ export INVITE_TOKEN=<token>
   ```

## Step 2/2. Apply labels

Follow any or all of the sections below to add different types of labels to
your resource.

### Apply a static label

You can configure static labels by editing the Teleport configuration file, then
starting Teleport.

To add a static label:

1. Open the Teleport configuration file, `/etc/teleport.yaml`, in an editor on the computer 
where you installed the Teleport agent.

1. Locate the `labels` configuration under the `ssh_service` section.

1. Add the static label key and value. 
   For example, add `environment` as the label key and `dev` as the value:

   ```yaml
   ssh_service:
     enabled: true
     labels:
       environment: dev
   ```

   The preceding example illustrates a simple value setting. However, you can also use static labels
   to define more complex string values that include white space or punctuation marks. 
   For example:

   ```code
   ssh_service:
     enabled: true
     labels:
       location: San Francisco Bldg 301 4th floor
   ```

1. Save your changes and close the file.

1. Start Teleport with the invitation token you saved in the `INVITE_TOKEN` environment variable:
   
   ```code
   $ sudo teleport start --token=${INVITE_TOKEN?}
   ```

1. Verify that you have added the label by running the following command 
on your local computer. 
      
   ```code
   $ tsh ls --query 'labels["environment"]=="dev"'
   ```

   You should see output similar to the following:

   ```code
   Node Name        Address    Labels                                                                                                       
   ---------------- ---------- ------------------------------------------
   ip-192-168-13-57 ⟵ Tunnel   environment=dev,hostname=ip-192-168-13-57
   ```

   **Checking the status of your server**

   If you don't see your server listed when you query for the label you added, you should verify that the 
   SSH Service is running on the server. Check the log for the server to verify that there are 
   messages similar to the following:
   
   ```text
   2023-08-07T22:22:21Z INFO [NODE:1]    Service is starting in tunnel mode. pid:149932.1 service/service.go:2630
   2023-08-07T22:22:21Z INFO [UPLOAD:1]  starting upload completer service pid:149932.1 service/service.go:2723
   2023-08-07T22:22:21Z INFO [PROC:1]    The new service has started successfully. Starting syncing rotation status...
   ```
   
   **Checking your user profile**
   
   If the SSH Service is running on the server, verify that your current Teleport user has a login on the local host.
   You can check the status of your user account by running the following command:
   
   ```code
   $ tsh status
   ```
      
   You should see output similar to the following with at least one login listed for your current user:
   
   ```code
   > Profile URL:        https://ajuba-aws.teledocs.click:443
     Logged in as:       teleport-admin
     Cluster:            teleport-aws.example.com
     Roles:              access, editor
     Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
     Kubernetes:         enabled
     Valid until:        2023-08-08 10:08:46 +0000 UTC [valid for 10h36m0s]
     Extensions:         login-ip, permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy
   ```
   
   If no valid logins have been assigned to the user, you should update your current user profile to include
   at least one valid login.
   
   You can add logins to a user by running a command similar to the following:
      
   ```code
   $ tctl users update myuser --set-logins=root
   ```
   
   This example adds the `root` login to the `myuser` Teleport user.
   For more information about managing logins for Teleport users, see [Local Users](./users.mdx).

**Using hidden static labels**

If you want to use labels for role-based access control but don't want to 
display the labels in command output or the Teleport Web UI, you can define them 
in a hidden namespace by prefixing the label key with `teleport.hidden/`.
For example:


```yaml
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  labels:
    teleport.hidden/team-id: ai-lab-01
``` 

### Apply dynamic labels using commands

As with static labels, you can apply dynamic labels by editing the
Teleport configuration file, then restarting the Teleport service on your server.

To add a command to generate a dynamic label:

1. Stop the Teleport service running on your server.

1. Open the Teleport configuration file—by default, `/etc/teleport.yaml`—in a text editor.

1. Locate the `commands` configuration under the `ssh_service` section.

1. Add a `command` array that runs the `uname` command with the `-p` argument to return the architecture of the 
host server every one hour. 
   
   For example, add the `name`, `command`, and `period` fields as follows:

   ```yaml
   ...
   ssh_service:
     enabled: "yes"
     labels:
       teleport.internal/resource-id: 1f2cdcc5-cde3-41fa-b390-bc872087821a
       environment: dev
     commands:
     - name: hostname
       command: [hostname]
       period: 1m0s
     - name: arch
       command: [uname, -p]
       period: 1h0m0s
   ```
   
   In the `command` setting, the first element is a valid executable. 
   Each subsequent element is an argument.
   The following syntax is valid:

   ```yaml
   command: ["/bin/uname", "-m"]
   ```
   
   The following syntax is not valid:

   ```yaml
   command: ["/bin/uname -m"]
   ```
   
   For more complex commands, you can use single (') and double (") 
   quotation marks interchangeably to create nested expressions. 
   For example:

   ```yaml
   command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "uname -a | egrep -o '[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+'"]
   ```
   
   In configuring commands, keep the following in mind:
   
   - The executable must be discoverable in the `$PATH` or specified using an absolute path. 
   - You must set the executable permission bit on any file you use as a command. 
   - Shell scripts must have a [shebang line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_\(Unix\)).
   
   The `period` setting specifies how frequently Teleport executes each command.
   In this example, the `uname -p` command is executed every one hour (1h), zero minutes (0m),
   and zero seconds (0s). This value can't be less than one minute.

1. Save your changes and close the file.

1. Start Teleport with the invitation token you saved in the `INVITE_TOKEN` environment variable:

   ```code
   $ sudo teleport start --token=${INVITE_TOKEN?}
   ```

1. Verify that you have added the label by running the following command on your local
computer. Your Teleport user must be authorized to access the server.

   ```code
   $ tsh ls
   ```

   You should see output similar to the following with both the `arch` and `environment` labels displayed:

   ```code
   Node Name        Address        Labels                                                                                                                   
   ---------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   ip-192-168-13-57 ⟵ Tunnel       arch=x86_64,environment=dev,hostname=ip-192-168-13-57
   ```

### Apply resource-based labels

Applying resource-based labels is only supported for servers.

You can apply resource-based labels to a Teleport instance by creating a `server_info`
resource for the instance. For a server with name `<name>`, its matching `server_info`
should be named `si-<name>`.

To add resource-based labels:

1. Run `tctl get node/<Var name="hostname"/>` to get the name of the node resource to apply labels to.
   You should get output similar to the following:

   ```yaml
   kind: node
   metadata:
      expires: "2024-01-12T00:41:17.355013266Z"
      id: <id>
      name: <name-uuid>
      revision: <revision-uuid>
   spec:
      # ...
   ```

   Save the value of `metadata.name` for the next step.

1. Create the file `server_info.yaml` and paste the following into it:

   ```yaml
   # server_info.yaml
   kind: server_info
   metadata:
      name: si-<node-name>
   spec:
      new_labels:
         "foo": "bar"
   ```

   Replace `<node-name>` with the resource name you saved in the previous step.
   Run the following to create the `server_info` resource:

   ```code
   $ tctl create server_info.yaml
   ```

1. Verify that you have added the label by running the following command on your local
computer. Your Teleport user must be authorized to access the server. Teleport
applies labels from `server_info` resources gradually to prevent strain on the Auth Service in
larger clusters, so it may take several minutes for the new labels to appear.

   ```code
   $ tsh ls
   ```

   You should see output similar to the following with the `dynamic/foo` label displayed:

   ```code
   Node Name        Address        Labels                                                                                                                   
   ---------------- -------------- ------------------------------------------------------
   ip-192-168-13-57 ⟵ Tunnel       dynamic/foo=bar,hostname=ip-192-168-13-57
   ```

<Admonition type="warning">
   All resource-based labels created with `tctl` will have the
   `dynamic/` prefix. This prefix forbids the label from being used in a
   role's deny rules.
</Admonition>

To update resource-based labels, recreate the `server_info` resource with updated labels.

## Next steps

After you have labeled your resources, you can use the labels when running
`tsh` and `tctl` commands to filter the resources that the commands return.
For more information, see [Resource filtering](../../reference/predicate-language.mdx).

You can also use labels to limit the access that users in different roles have to

specific classes of resources. For more information, see
[Teleport Role Templates](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx).
