When users log in to your Teleport cluster with a configured SSO provider,
**Login Rules** can transform the traits provided by your IdP to meet your needs
for configuring access within Teleport.
Login Rules are a feature of Teleport Enterprise.

Some use cases for Login Rules are:

- When you need to modify a user trait based on logical rules, like
  "users in group `db-admins` should also be added to group `db-users`",
  Login Rules provide a powerful expression language to make these changes
  without needing to modify claims in your IdP.
- When your IdP provides a large number of traits with many values, all of these
  traits will be included in your user's SSH certificates and JWTs, which can
  become too large for some third-party applications to handle.  Login Rules can
  filter out unnecessary traits and keep just the ones you need.
- When you have multiple [Role Templates](./guides/role-templates.mdx) repeating
  the same logic to combine and transform external traits, consider using Login
  Rules to consolidate the logic to one place and simplify your Roles.

Login Rules can solve these problems without requiring changes to your
organization's IdP.

Login Rules use a predicate language to provide maximum flexibility when
configuring your cluster.
This allows you to write simple or complex expressions to define the traits your
users should be granted.

For example, you can convert the value of a `username` trait to lowercase and
conditionally extend the value of a groups trait with the following
snippet:
```yaml
traits_map:
  username:
    - 'strings.lower(external.username)'
  groups:
    - 'ifelse(external.groups.contains("db-admins"), external.groups.add("db-users"), external.groups)'
```

Check out the [Login Rules guide](./login-rules/guide.mdx) for a quick walkthrough
that will show you how to write, test, and add the first Login Rule to your
cluster. See [example Login Rules](./login-rules/guide.mdx#example-login-rules) to
learn how to address common use cases.

When you're ready to take full advantage of Login Rules in your cluster, see the
[Login Rules Reference](../../reference/access-controls/login-rules.mdx) for details on the expression
language that powers them.

## FAQ

### Which users do Login Rules apply to?

Login Rules apply to all users logging in via OIDC, SAML, or GitHub.
They do not apply to local Teleport users.

### When are Login Rules evaluated?

Login Rules are evaluated once during each user login, after receiving the
claims or assertions from your IdP, before mapping claims/assertions to Teleport
roles, and before generating user certificates.
If Login Rules modify any traits used for role mapping, the role mapping will be
affected.

### Can I define custom helper functions for the predicate language?

No, but if you have a use case which is not adequately met by the currently
supported helper functions, please talk to support or submit a GitHub issue and
we will consider adding helpers which are generally useful.

### Can I have multiple Login Rules in a single cluster?

Yes.
All Login Rules installed in the cluster will first be sorted by priority and
then evaluated in order.
Each subsequent Login Rule will receive the full output of the previous rule as
its input.
It is strongly recommended to give each Login Rule a unique priority, but ties
will be broken by sorting by the rule name.
