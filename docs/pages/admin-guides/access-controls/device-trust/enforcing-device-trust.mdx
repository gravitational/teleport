<Admonition type="notice" title="Supported Resources">
Device trust fully supports SSH, Database and Kubernetes resources using
cluster-wide or role-based enforcement.

Apps and Desktops may enforce trusted devices using role-based enforcement. See the [App
Access support](#app-access-support) and the [Desktop Access support](#desktop-access-support)
sections for further details.

</Admonition>

Resources protected by the device mode "required" will enforce the use of a
trusted device, in addition to establishing the user's identity and enforcing
the necessary roles. Furthermore, users using a trusted device leave audit
trails that include the device's information.

Device Trust enforcement can be configured with the following three modes of operation, represented
by the `device_trust_mode` authentication setting:

- `off` - disables Device Trust. Device authentication is not performed and
  device-aware audit logs are absent.
- `optional` - enables device authentication and device-aware audit, but does
  not require a trusted device to access resources.
- `required` - enables device authentication and device-aware audit.
  Additionally, it requires a trusted device for all SSH, Database and
  Kubernetes connections.

### Prerequisites
(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/device-trust/prereqs.mdx!)

- We expect your Teleport cluster to be on version 13.3.6 and above, which has
  the preset `require-trusted-device` role. The preset `require-trusted-device`
  role does not enforce the use of a trusted device for
  [Apps](#app-access-support) or [Desktops](#desktop-access-support).  Refer to
  their corresponding sections for instructions.

## Role-based trusted device enforcement

Role-based configuration enforces trusted device access at the role level. It
can be configured with the `spec.options.device_trust_mode` option and
applies to the resources in its `allow` rules. It
works similarly to [`require_session_mfa`](../guides/per-session-mfa.mdx).

To enforce authenticated device checks for a specific role when a user accesses
databases, Kubernetes clusters, and servers with Teleport, update the role with
the `device_trust_mode` field assigned to `"required"`. The following example
updates the preset `require-trusted-device` role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: require-trusted-device
spec:
  options:
    device_trust_mode: "required"
  allow:
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    db_names:
    - '*'
    db_users:
    - '*'
    kubernetes_groups:
    - '{{internal.kubernetes_groups}}'
    - system:masters
    - developers
    - viewers
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    logins:
    - '{{internal.logins}}'
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Update the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f device-enforcement.yaml
```

## Cluster-wide trusted device enforcement

Cluster-wide configuration enforces trusted device access at the cluster level.
Enterprise clusters run in `optional` mode by default. Changing the mode to
`required` will enforce a trusted device for all SSH, Database and Kubernetes
accesses.

To enable device mode `required` update your configuration as follows:

<Tabs dropDownCaption="Teleport Deployment">
<TabItem label="Dynamic Resources" options="Self-Hosted,Teleport Enterprise Cloud" >
Create a `cap.yaml` file or get the existing configuration using
`tctl get cluster_auth_preference`:

```diff
kind: cluster_auth_preference
version: v2
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  type: local
  second_factor: "on"
  webauthn:
    rp_id: (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=)
  device_trust:
+   mode: "required" # add this line
```

Update the configuration:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
cluster auth preference has been updated
```

You can also edit this configuration directly:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_auth_preference
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Static Config" options="Self-Hosted">
Edit the Auth Server's `teleport.yaml` file and restart all Auth Services:

```diff
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: local
    second_factor: "on"
    webauthn:
      rp_id: (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=)
    device_trust:
+     mode: "required" # add this line
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the config is updated, SSH, Database and Kubernetes access without a trusted device will be forbidden.
For example, SSH access without a trusted device fails with the following error:

```code
$ tsh ssh (=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
ERROR: ssh: rejected: administratively prohibited (unauthorized device)
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Trusted Clusters">
It is possible to use [trusted
clusters](../../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) to limit the impact of
device mode `required`. A leaf cluster in mode `required` will enforce access to
all of its resources, without imposing the same restrictions to the root
cluster. Likewise, a root cluster will not enforce Device Trust on resources in
leaf clusters.
</Admonition>

## App Access support

The Teleport App Service may enforce Device Trust via [role-based enforcement](
#role-based-trusted-device-enforcement).

To access apps protected by Device Trust using the Web UI (Teleport v16 or
later), make sure your device is [registered and enrolled](
./device-management.mdx#register-a-trusted-device), install [Teleport Connect](../../../connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx), and
follow the instructions during login.

Alternatively, you may use [tsh proxy app](../../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx) or the certificates issued by
`tsh app login`.

As an example, to enforce Device Trust for all `env:production` apps, save the
role below as `require-trusted-device-apps.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: require-trusted-device-apps
spec:
  options:
    device_trust_mode: "required"
  allow:
    app_labels:
      env: production
```

Create the role and assign it to a user:

```code
$ tctl create require-trusted-device-apps.yaml
$ tctl edit users/alice
```

```diff
kind: user
metadata:
  name: alice
  # (...)
spec:
  roles:
  - access
  - editor
+ - require-trusted-device-apps
  # (...)
version: v2
```

Now the alice user can only access `env:production` apps using a trusted device.

## Desktop Access support

The Teleport Desktop Service may enforce Device Trust via [role-based
enforcement]( #role-based-trusted-device-enforcement).

To access desktops protected by Device Trust make sure your device is
[registered and enrolled](./device-management.mdx#register-a-trusted-device),
install [Teleport Connect](../../../connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx), and
follow the instructions during login.

As an example, to enforce Device Trust for all `env:production` desktops, save
the role below as `require-trusted-device-desktops.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: require-trusted-device-desktops
spec:
  options:
    device_trust_mode: "required"
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      env: "production"
    windows_desktop_logins: ["Administrator", "alice"]
```

Create the role and assign it to a user:

```code
$ tctl create require-trusted-device-desktops.yaml
$ tctl edit users/alice
```

```diff
kind: user
metadata:
  name: alice
  # (...)
spec:
  roles:
  - access
  - editor
+ - require-trusted-device-desktops
  # (...)
version: v2
```

Now the alice user can only access `env:production` desktops using a trusted
device.

## Locking a device

Similar to [session and identity locking](../guides/locking.mdx), a device can
be locked using `tctl lock`.

Locking blocks certificate issuance and ongoing or future accesses originating
from a locked device. Locking a device only works if Device Trust is enabled and
if the device is enrolled to Teleport.

Find a device ID to lock:

```code
$ tctl devices ls
Asset Tag     OS    Enroll Status   Device ID
------------ -----  ------------- ------------------------------------
(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)  macOS  enrolled     (=devicetrust.device_id=)
```

Lock a device:

```code
$ tctl lock --device=(=devicetrust.device_id=) --ttl=12h
Created a lock with name "5444970a-39a0-4814-968d-e58b4a8fa686".
```

Now, if a user on that device tries to access an SSH server for example,
Teleport will deny access:

```code
$ tsh ssh (=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
ERROR: ssh: rejected: administratively prohibited (lock targeting Device:"(=devicetrust.device_id=)" is in force)
```
