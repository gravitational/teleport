Device Trust requires two of the following steps to have been configured:

- Device enforcement mode configured via either a role or a cluster-wide config.
- Trusted device registered and enrolled with Teleport.

In this guide, you will update an existing user profile to assign the preset `require-trusted-device`
role and then enroll a trusted device into Teleport to access a resource (a test linux server)
protected with Teleport.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/device-trust/prereqs.mdx!)

- User with `editor` role.
  ```code
  $ tsh status
  > Profile URL:      (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=):443
  Logged in as:       (=clusterDefaults.username=)
  Cluster:            (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=)
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor
  Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
  Kubernetes:         disabled
  Valid until:        2023-08-22 03:30:24 -0400 EDT [valid for 11h52m0s]
  Extensions:         login-ip, permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy
  ```
- Access to a linux server (any Linux server you can access via `tsh ssh` will do).
  ```code
  $ tsh ls
  Node Name        Address        Labels
  ---------------- -------------- --------------------------------------
  (=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=) ⟵ Tunnel

  # test connection to (=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
  $ tsh ssh root@(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
  root@(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=):~#
  ```

Once the above prerequisites are met, begin with the following step.

## Step 1/2. Update user profile to enforce Device Trust

To enforce Device Trust, a user must be assigned with a role with Device Trust mode "required".

For this guide, we will use the preset `require-trusted-device` role to update current user profile.

Open the user resource in your editor so we can update it with the preset `require-trusted-device` role.

```code
$ tctl edit users/(=clusterDefaults.username=)
```

Edit the profile:

```diff
kind: user
metadata:
  id: 1692716146877042322
  name: (=clusterDefaults.username=)
spec:
  created_by:
    time: "2023-08-14T13:42:22.291972449Z"
  expires: "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  roles:
  - access
  - auditor
  - editor
+ - require-trusted-device # add this line
  status:
    is_locked: false
  ...
```

Update the user by saving and closing the file in your editor.

Now that the user profile is updated to enforce Device Trust, try to access the test server
again.

```code
$ tsh logout; tsh login --proxy=(=clusterDefaults.clusterName=) --user=(=clusterDefaults.username=)
$ tsh ssh root@(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
ERROR: access denied to root connecting to (=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=):0
```

As you can verify from the above step, access to `(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)` ssh server,
which was previously accessible, is now forbidden.

## Step 2/2. Enroll device

To access `(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)` server again, you will have to enroll your device.

Enrolling your device is easy, and can be done using `tsh` client:

```code
$ tsh device enroll --current-device
Device "(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/macOS registered and enrolled
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="self enrollment">
  The `--current-device` flag tells `tsh` to enroll the current device. The user must have the preset `editor`
  or `device-admin` role to be able to self-enroll their device. For users without the `editor` or
  `device-admin` roles, a device admin must generate the an enrollment token, which can then be
  used to enroll the device. Learn more about manual device enrollment in the
  [device management guide](./device-management.mdx#register-a-trusted-device).
</Admonition>

Relogin to fetch updated certificate with device extension:

```code
$ tsh logout; tsh login --proxy=(=clusterDefaults.clusterName=) --user=(=clusterDefaults.username=)

$ tsh status
> Profile URL:        (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=):443
  Logged in as:       (=clusterDefaults.username=)
  Cluster:            (=clusterDefaults.clusterName=):443
  Roles:              access, auditor, editor
  Logins:             root
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Valid until:        2023-08-22 04:06:53 -0400 EDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
  Extensions:         login-ip, ... teleport-device-asset-tag, teleport-device-credential-id, teleport-device-id
```

The presence of the `teleport-device-*` extensions shows that the device was successfully authenticated.

Now, let's try to access server (`(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)`) again:

```code
$ tsh ssh root@(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=)
root@(=clusterDefaults.nodeIP=):~#
```

Congratulations! You have successfully configured a Trusted Device and accessed a resource protected with
Device Trust enforcement.

- [Enforcing Device Trust](./enforcing-device-trust.mdx)
- [Jamf Pro Integration](./jamf-integration.mdx)
- The role we illustrated in this guide uses the `internal.logins` trait,
  which Teleport replaces with values from the Teleport local user
  database. For full details on how traits work in Teleport roles,
  see the [Access Controls
  Reference](../../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).
