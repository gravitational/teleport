title: Teleport Zero Trust Access Requests with Email
description: How to set up the Teleport email plugin to notify users when another user requests elevated privileges.
---

This guide will explain how to set up Teleport to send Just-in-Time Access
Request notifications to users via email. Since all organizations use email for
at least some of their communications, Teleport's email plugin makes it
straightforward to integrate Access Requests into your existing workflows,
letting you implement security best practices without compromising productivity.

![The email Access Request plugin](../../../../img/enterprise/plugins/email.png)

<Details title="This integration is hosted on Teleport Enterprise (Cloud)" open={false}>

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/enroll.mdx name="the Email integration"!)

![Enroll email plugin](../../../../img/enterprise/plugins/email/enroll-email.png)

Configure and connect email integration by providing the following configuration
values:

**`Sender`**: Configures the sender address.

**`Fallback Recipient`**: Configures the default recipient for Access Request
notifications.

**`Email Service`**: Selects the desired email service. Note: only `Mailgun` is
supported for Teleport Enterprise (Cloud).

![Configure Mailgun integration](../../../../img/enterprise/plugins/email/configure-mailgun.png)

Complete Mailgun integration by providing the following Mailgun API
configuration values:

**`Domain`**: Configures the Mailgun sending domain.

**`Mailgun Private Key`**: Configures the Mailgun API key.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/plugin-prerequisites.mdx!)

- Access to an SMTP service. The Teleport email plugin supports either Mailgun
  or a generic SMTP service that authenticates via username and password.
- Either a Linux host or Kubernetes cluster where you will run the email plugin.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Protecting your email account">

The Teleport plugin needs to use a username and password to authenticate to your
SMTP service. To mitigate the risk of these credentials being leaked, you should
set up a dedicated email account for the Teleport plugin and rotate the password
regularly.

</Admonition>

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/7. Define RBAC resources

Before you set up the email plugin, enable Role Access Requests in your Teleport cluster.

(!/docs/pages/includes/plugins/editor-request-rbac.mdx!)

## Step 2/7. Install the Teleport email plugin

<Details title="Using a local SMTP server?">

If you are using a local SMTP server to test the plugin, you should install the
plugin on your local machine to ensure the plugin can connect to the SMTP server 
and perform any necessary DNS lookups to send email.

Your Teleport cluster does *not* need to perform DNS lookups for your plugin
because the plugin dials out to the Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Auth Service. 

</Details>

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/install-access-request.mdx name="email"!)

## Step 3/7. Create a user and role for the plugin

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/rbac.mdx!)

(!/docs/pages/includes/plugins/rbac-impersonate.mdx!)

## Step 4/7. Export the access plugin identity

Give the plugin access to a Teleport identity file. We recommend using Machine
ID for this in order to produce short-lived identity files that are less
dangerous if exfiltrated, though in demo deployments, you can generate
longer-lived identity files with `tctl`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Machine ID">
(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/tbot-identity.mdx secret="teleport-plugin-email-identity"!)
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Long-lived identity files">
(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/identity-export.mdx user="access-plugin" secret="teleport-plugin-email-identity" !)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 5/7. Configure the plugin

At this point, you have generated credentials that the email plugin will use to
connect to Teleport. You will now configure the plugin to use these credentials
to receive Access Request notifications from Teleport and email them to your
chosen recipients.

### Create a config file

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable or Docker">

The Teleport email plugin uses a configuration file in TOML format. Generate a
boilerplate configuration by running the following command:

```code
$ teleport-email configure | sudo tee /etc/teleport-email.toml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart">
The email plugin Helm Chart uses a YAML values file to configure the plugin.
On your local workstation, create a file called `teleport-email-helm.yaml`
based on the following example:

```yaml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-email-helm.yaml!)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Edit the configuration file

Edit the configuration file for your environment. We will show you how to set
each value below.

### `[teleport]`

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/config-toml-teleport.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/refresh-plugin-identity.mdx!)

### `[mailgun]` or `[smtp]`

Provide the credentials for your SMTP service depending on whether you are using
Mailgun or SMTP service.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Mailgun">

If you are deploying the email plugin on a Linux host:

1. In the `mailgun` section, assign `domain` to the domain name and subdomain of
   your Mailgun account. 
1. Assign `mailgun.private_key` to your Mailgun private key.

If you are deploying the email plugin on Kubernetes:

1. Write your Mailgun private key to a local file called `mailgun-private-key`.
1. Create a Kubernetes secret from the file:

  ```code
  $ kubectl -n teleport create secret generic mailgun-private-key --from-file=mailgun-private-key
  ```

1. Assign `mailgun.privateKeyFromSecret` to `mailgun-private-key`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Generic SMTP Service">

Assign `host` to the fully qualified domain name of your SMTP service, omitting
the URL scheme and port. (If you're using a local SMTP server for testing, use
`"localhost"` for `host`.) Assign `port` to the port of your SMTP service.

If you are running the email plugin on a Linux host, fill in `username` and
`password`.

<Admonition type="tip">

You can also save your password to a separate file and assign `password_file` to
the file's path. The plugin reads the file and uses the file's content as the
password.

</Admonition>

If you are deploying the email plugin on Kubernetes:

1. Write your SMTP service's password a local file called `smtp-password.txt`.
1. Create a Kubernetes secret from the file:

  ```code
  $ kubectl -n teleport create secret generic smtp-password --from-file=smtp-password
  ```

1. Assign `smtp.passwordFromSecret` to `smtp-password`.

<Details title="Disabling TLS for testing">

If you are testing the email plugin against a trusted internal SMTP server where
you would rather not use TLS—e.g., a local SMTP server on your development
machine—you can assign the `starttls_policy` setting to `disabled` (always
disable TLS) or `opportunistic` (disable TLS if the server does not advertise
the `STARTTLS` extension). The default is to always enforce TLS, and you should
leave this setting unassigned unless you know what you are doing and understand
the risks.

For Kubernetes deployments, `starttls_policy` is called `smtp.starttlsPolicy` in
the Helm values file for the email plugin.

</Details>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `[delivery]`

Assign `sender` to the email address from which you would like the Teleport
plugin to send messages.

### `[role_to_recipients]`

The `role_to_recipients` map (`roleToRecipients` for Helm users) configures the
recipients that the email plugin will notify when a user requests access to a
specific role. When the plugin receives an Access Request from the Auth Service,
it will look up the role being requested and identify the recipients to notify.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable or Docker">

Here is an example of a `role_to_recipients` map. Each value can be a single
string or an array of strings:

```toml
[role_to_recipients]
"*" = ["security@example.com", "executive-team@example.com"]
"dev" = "eng@example.com"
"dba" = "mallory@example.com"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart">

In the Helm chart, the `role_to_recipients` field is called `roleToRecipients`
and uses the following format, where keys are strings and values are arrays of
strings:

```yaml
roleToRecipients:
  "*": ["security@example.com", "executive-team@example.com"]
  "dev": ["eng@example.com"]
  "dba": ["mallory@example.com"]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the `role_to_recipients` map, each key is the name of a Teleport role. Each
value configures the recipients the plugin will email when it receives an Access
Request for that role.  Each string must be an email address.

The `role_to_recipients` map must also include an entry for `"*"`, which the
plugin looks up if no other entry matches a given role name. In the example
above, requests for roles aside from `dev` and `dba` will notify
`security@example.com` and `executive-team@example.com`.

<Details title="Suggested reviewers">

Users can suggest reviewers when they create an Access Request, e.g.,:

```code
$ tsh request create --roles=dbadmin --reviewers=alice@example.com,ivan@example.com
```

If an Access Request includes suggested reviewers, the email plugin will add
these to the list of recipients to notify. If a suggested reviewer is an email
address, the plugin will send a message to that recipient in addition to those
configured in `role_to_recipients`.

</Details>

Configure the email plugin to notify you when a user requests the `editor` role
by adding the following to your `role_to_recipients` config, replacing
`YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with the appropriate address: 

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable or Docker" >
```toml
[role_to_recipients]
"*" = "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
"editor" = "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart" >
```yaml
roleToRecipients:
  "*": "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
  "editor": "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Details title="Configuring recipients without role mapping">

If you do not plan to use role-to-recipient mapping, you can configure the
Teleport email plugin to notify a static list of recipients for every Access
Request event by using the `delivery.recipients` field:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable or Docker">
```toml
[delivery]
recipients = ["eng@exmaple.com", "dev@example.com"]
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart">
```yaml
delivery:
  recipients: ["eng@exmaple.com", "dev@example.com"]
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you use `delivery.recipients`, you must remove the `role_to_recipients`
configuration section. Behind the scenes, `delivery.recipients` assigns the
recipient list to a `role_to_recipients` mapping under the wildcard value `"*"`.

</Details>

You configuration should resemble the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable or Docker">

```toml
# /etc/teleport-email.toml
[teleport]
addr = "example.com:443"
identity = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/identity"
refresh_identity = true

[mailgun]
domain = "sandbox123abc.mailgun.org" 
private_key = "xoxb-fakekey62b0eac53565a38c8cc0316f6"

# As an alternative, you can use SMTP server credentials:
#
# [smtp]
# host = "smtp.gmail.com"
# port = 587
# username = "username@gmail.com"
# password = ""
# password_file = "/var/lib/teleport/plugins/email/smtp_password"
# starttls_policy = "mandatory"

[delivery]
sender = "noreply@example.com" 

[role_to_recipients]
"*" = "eng@example.com"
"editor" = ["admin@example.com", "execs@example.com"]

[log]
output = "stderr" # Logger output. Could be "stdout", "stderr" or "/var/lib/teleport/email.log"
severity = "INFO" # Logger severity. Could be "INFO", "ERROR", "DEBUG" or "WARN".
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart">

```yaml
# teleport-email-helm.yaml
teleport:
  address: "teleport.example.com:443"
  identitySecretName: teleport-plugin-email-identity
  identitySecretPath: identity

mailgun:
  domain: "sandbox123abc.mailgun.org" 
  privateKeyFromSecret: "mailgun-private-key"

# As an alternative, you can use SMTP server credentials:
#
# smtp:
#   host: "smtp.gmail.com"
#   port: 587
#   username: "username@gmail.com"
#   passwordFromSecret: "smtp-password"
#   starttls_policy = "mandatory"

delivery:
  sender: "noreply@example.com" 

roleToRecipients:
  "*": "eng@example.com"
  "editor": ["admin@example.com", "execs@example.com"]
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 6/7. Test the email plugin

After finishing your configuration, you can now run the plugin and test your
email-based Access Request flow:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Executable">

```code
$ teleport-email start
```

If everything works as expected, the log output should look like this:

```code
$ teleport-email start
INFO   Starting Zero Trust Access Email Plugin (): email/app.go:80
INFO   Plugin is ready email/app.go:101
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Docker">
Start the plugin:

```code
$ docker run -v <path-to-config>:/etc/teleport-email.toml public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-plugin-email:(=teleport.version=) start
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Helm Chart">
Install the plugin:

```code
$ helm upgrade --install teleport-plugin-email teleport/teleport-plugin-email --values teleport-email-helm.yaml
```

To inspect the plugin's logs, use the following command:

```code
$ kubectl logs deploy/teleport-plugin-email
```

Debug logs can be enabled by setting `log.severity` to `DEBUG` in
`teleport-email-helm.yaml` and executing the `helm upgrade ...` command
above again. Then you can restart the plugin with the following command:

```code
$ kubectl rollout restart deployment teleport-plugin-email
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create an Access Request

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/create-request.mdx!)

The recipients you configured earlier should receive notifications of the
request by email. 

### Resolve the request

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/resolve-request.mdx!)

## Step 7/7. Set up systemd

This section is only relevant if you are running the Teleport email plugin on a
Linux host.

In production, we recommend starting the Teleport plugin daemon via an init
system like systemd. Here's the recommended Teleport plugin service unit file
for systemd:

```ini
(!/examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-email.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-email.service` in either `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` or
another [unit file load
path](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html#Unit%20File%20Load%20Path)
supported by systemd.

Enable and start the plugin:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport-email
$ sudo systemctl start teleport-email
```
