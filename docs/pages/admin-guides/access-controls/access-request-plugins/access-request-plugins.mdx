Teleport Just-in-Time Access Requests allow users to receive temporary elevated
privileges by seeking consent from one or more reviewers, depending on your
configuration.

With Teleport's Access Request plugins, users can manage Access Requests from
within your organization's existing messaging and project management solutions.

Access Request plugins are self-contained programs that connect to the Teleport
Auth Service's gRPC API to listen for audit events relating to new or updated
Access Requests. After processing an Access Request event, Access Request plugins
interact with a third-party API (e.g., the Slack or PagerDuty APIs). 

## Enrolling Access Request plugins in Teleport Cloud

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/enroll.mdx name="Access Request plugins"!)

The following Access Request plugins are hosted on Teleport Cloud:

- Discord
- Jira
- Mattermost
- Opsgenie
- PagerDuty
- ServiceNow
- Slack

## Self-hosting Access Request plugins

You can host Teleport Access Request plugins yourself. Self-hosted Access
Request plugins are the only way to manage Access Requests through a third-party
communication platform if you are self-hosting Teleport. If you use Teleport
Team or Teleport Enterprise Cloud, you can run self-hosted Access Request
plugins for more control over configuration and architecture.

Access Request plugins can run within private networks that are isolated from
the Teleport Auth Service. To access the Auth Service API, they connect to the
Proxy Service, which establishes a reverse tunnel for the plugin to access the
Auth Service.

You can run multiple instances of an Access Request plugin for high availability
by deploying each instance in a separate availability zone. There is no need for
additional configuration or load balancing, as plugins avoid creating duplicate
requests to their third-party APIs.

Learn how to deploy and configure a plugin for your organization's communication
workflows by reading our setup guides:
