title: Deploy Login Rules via Terraform 
description: Use Teleport's Terraform Provider to deploy Login Rules to your cluster
---

This guide will explain how to:

- Use Teleport's Terraform Provider to deploy Login Rules to your Teleport cluster
- Edit deployed Login Rules via Terraform

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

## Step 1/4. Set up Teleport credentials for Terraform

For simplicity, this guide will configure the Terraform provider to use your
current logged-in user's Teleport credentials obtained from `tsh login`.

<Admonition type="note">
The [Terraform provider guide](../../management/dynamic-resources/terraform-provider.mdx)
includes instructions for configuring a dedicated `terraform` user and role,
which is a better option when running Terraform in a non-interactive
environment.

If you are already using Terraform to manage other resources in your Teleport
cluster then you have probably already set up a `terraform` user and role and
configured the associated credentials.
Make sure to use the `terraform` role from the latest version of the guide,
which has `list`, `read`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` verbs for
`login_rule` resources.
</Admonition>

First, ensure you are logged into Teleport as a user that has permissions to
read and modify `login_rule` resources.
The preset `editor` role has access to this already, but in case you are using a
more customized configuration, create a role called `loginrule-manager.yaml`
with the following contents:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: loginrule-manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: [login_rule]
        verbs: [list, read, create, update, delete]
version: v7
```

Create the role with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create loginrule-manager.yaml
role 'loginrule-manager' has been created
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="loginrule-manager" !)

## Step 2/4. Create a Terraform configuration

Paste the following into a file called `main.tf` to configure the Terraform
provider and create two example Login Rules.
Make sure to update the `addr = "teleport.example.com:443"` field with the
public address of your Teleport Proxy.

```hcl
(!examples/resources/terraform/terraform-login-rules.tf!)
```

## Step 3/4. Apply the configuration

Init Terraform and apply the configuration:

```code
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply
```

## Step 4/4. Make sure everything worked

Double-check that the new Login Rules are now available in your cluster:

```code
$ tctl get login_rules
kind: login_rule
metadata:
  description: Terraform test rule using traits_expression
  id: 1680190764978381000
  labels:
    example: "yes"
  name: terraform-test-expression-rule
spec:
  priority: 1
  traits_expression: |
    external.put("groups",
      choose(
        option(external.groups.contains("admins"),
external.groups.add("app-admins", "db-admins")),
        option(external.groups.contains("ops"),
external.groups.add("k8s-admins")),
        option(true, external.groups)))
version: v1
---
kind: login_rule
metadata:
  description: Terraform test rule using traits_map
  id: 1680193055097268000
  labels:
    example: "yes"
  name: terraform-test-map-rule
spec:
  priority: 0
  traits_map:
    groups:
    - external.groups
    logins:
    - strings.lower(external.username)
    - external.logins
version: v1
```

Test the Login Rules you just installed with the `tctl login_rule test` command.
The `--load-from-cluster` flag tells the command to load all Login Rules
currently installed in the cluster.
You can send example traits to the standard input of the command, and it will
print the final traits after transformation by the Login Rules.

```code
$ echo '{"groups": ["admins", "ops"], "username": ["Alice"], "logins": ["user", "root"]}' | \
  tctl login_rule test --load-from-cluster
groups:
- admins
- ops
- app-admins
- db-admins
logins:
- alice
- user
- root
```

## Next Steps

- Read the [Terraform Guide](../../management/dynamic-resources/terraform-provider.mdx) to
  learn more about configuring the Terraform provider.
- Read the [Login Rules reference](./reference.mdx) to learn mode about the
  Login Rule expression syntax.
