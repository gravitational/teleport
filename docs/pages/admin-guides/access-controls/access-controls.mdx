description: How to provide role-based access control (RBAC) for servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, and other resources in your infrastructure

After [deploying a Teleport cluster](../../index.mdx), the
next step is to manage the access that Teleport users have to resources in your
infrastructure.

Teleport's role-based access control (RBAC) enables you to set fine-grained
policies for who can perform certain actions against specific resources. For
example:

- Analytics team members can SSH into a MongoDB read replica, but not the main
  database.
- Interns can't access production databases.
- SREs can access a production server only when using a [trusted hardware
  device](./device-trust/guide.mdx).
- Members of a team can access the production Kubernetes cluster if approved by
  someone else from the same team.

## Get started

Configure Access Controls with our five-minute [Getting
Started](./getting-started.mdx) guide.

## Set up Teleport roles

The heart of Teleport's RBAC system is the **role**, a configuration document
that specifies access policies for resources in your Teleport cluster.
Assigning a role to a Teleport user applies the policies listed in the role to
the user.

See the [Cluster Access and RBAC](./guides.mdx) section for instructions on
setting up Teleport roles.

## Integrate with your Single Sign-On provider

While you can create Teleport users directly on the Auth Service, the more
scalable approach is to integrate Teleport with a Single Sign-On identity
provider (IdP), such as Okta or GitHub.

When a user authenticates to your Teleport cluster via your IdP, Teleport
automatically assigns roles to the user based on data provided by the IdP. This
means that you can implement a fully fledged infrastructure RBAC system based on
your existing Single Sign-On solution.

Read our [Single Sign-On guide](./sso.mdx) to get started.

## Enable Access Requests

With Access Requests, your Teleport cluster can grant a user temporary access to
resources in your infrastructure based on the approval of other users. You can
set up your RBAC so all privileged access is short lived, and there are no
longstanding admin roles for attackers to hijack.

[Get started with Access Requests](./access-requests.mdx).

You can integrate Teleport with your existing communication tool, e.g., Slack,
PagerDuty, or Microsoft Teams, so Teleport users can easily create and approve
Access Requests.

[Get started with Access Request plugins](access-request-plugins.mdx).

## Achieve compliance

Teleport's RBAC features make it easier to manage access to your infrastructure
in order to satisfy compliance requirements. Learn how to use Teleport to
achieve compliance with:

- [FedRAMP](./compliance-frameworks/fedramp.mdx)
- [SOC 2](./compliance-frameworks/soc2.mdx)
