Teleport's role-based access control (RBAC) enables you to set fine-grained
policies for who can perform certain actions against specific resources. For
example, you can allow analytics team members to SSH into a MongoDB read
replica, but not the main database. You can also allow SREs to access a
production server only when using a [trusted hardware
device](./device-trust/guide.mdx), or if approved by someone else from the same
team.
