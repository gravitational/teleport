title: Per-session MFA
description: Require MFA checks to initiate sessions.
videoBanner: j8Ze7HhjFGw

Teleport supports requiring additional multi-factor authentication checks
when starting new:

- SSH connections (a single `tsh ssh` call, Web UI SSH session or Teleport Connect SSH session)
- Kubernetes sessions (a single `kubectl` call)
- Database sessions (a single `tsh db connect` call)
- Desktop sessions

This is an advanced security feature that protects users against compromises of
their on-disk Teleport certificates.

<Admonition type="note">
  In addition to per-session MFA, enable login MFA in your SSO provider and/or
  for all [local Teleport
  users](../../../reference/access-controls/authentication.mdx)
  to improve security.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- [WebAuthn configured](webauthn.mdx) on this cluster
- Second factor hardware device, such as YubiKey or SoloKey
- A Web browser with [WebAuthn support](
  https://developers.yubico.com/WebAuthn/WebAuthn_Browser_Support/) (if using
  SSH or desktop sessions from the Teleport Web UI).

<Admonition type="note" title="Per-session MFA with FIPS" scope="enterprise" scopeOnly>

Teleport FIPS builds disable local users. To configure WebAuthn in order to use
per-session MFA with FIPS builds, provide the following in your `teleport.yaml`:

```yaml
teleport:
  auth_service:
    local_auth: false
    second_factor: optional
    webauthn:
      rp_id: teleport.example.com
```

</Admonition>

## Configure per-session MFA

Per-session MFA can be enforced cluster-wide or only for some specific roles.

### Cluster-wide

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

To enforce MFA checks for all roles, edit your cluster authentication
configuration:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Static configuration">

Update `teleport.yaml` on the Auth Server to include the following content:

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    # require per-session MFA cluster-wide
    require_session_mfa: yes
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dynamic resources">

Obtain your existing `cluster_auth_preference` resource:

```code
$ tctl get cap > cap.yaml
```

Ensure that `cap.yaml` contains the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  require_session_mfa: true
version: v2
```

Create the resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope="cloud" label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

Obtain your existing `cluster_auth_preference` resource:

```code
$ tctl get cap > cap.yaml
```

Ensure that `cap.yaml` contains the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  require_session_mfa: true
version: v2
```

Create the resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Per role

To enforce MFA checks for a specific role, update the role to contain:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: example-role-with-mfa
spec:
  options:
    # require per-session MFA for this role
    require_session_mfa: true
  allow:
    ...
  deny:
    ...
```

Role-specific enforcement only applies when accessing resources matching a
role's `allow` section.

### Roles example

Let's walk through an example of setting up per-session MFA checks for roles.

Jerry is an engineer with access to the company infrastructure. The
infrastructure is split into development and production environments. Security
engineer Olga wants to enforce MFA checks for accessing production servers.
Development servers don't require this to reduce engineers' friction.

Olga defines two Teleport roles: `access-dev` and `access-prod`:

```yaml
# access-dev.yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: access-dev
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: dev
    logins:
      - jerry
---
# access-prod.yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: access-prod
spec:
  options:
    # require per-session MFA for production access
    require_session_mfa: true
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: prod
    logins:
      - jerry
  deny: {}
```

Olga then assigns both roles to all engineers, including Jerry.

When Jerry logs into node `dev1.example.com` (with label `env: dev` as login `jerry`), nothing
special happens:

```code
$ tsh ssh jerry@dev1.example.com

# jerry@dev1.example.com >
```

But when Jerry logs into node `rod3.example.com` (with label `env: prod` as login `jerry`), he
gets prompted for an MFA check:

```code
$ tsh ssh jerry@prod3.example.com
# Tap any security key <tap>

# jerry@prod3.example.com >
```

<Admonition title="OTP" type="tip">
If you are using `tsh` in a constrained environment, you can tell it to use
OTP by doing `tsh --mfa-mode=otp ssh prod3.example.com`.

OTP can only be used with per-session MFA when using `tsh` or Teleport Connect to
establish connections. A hardware MFA key is required for using per-session
MFA with Teleport's Web UI.
</Admonition>

If per-session MFA was enabled cluster-wide, Jerry would be prompted for MFA
even when logging into `dev1.example.com`.

<Admonition title="Per-session MFA for Database Access" type="tip">

The Teleport Database Service supports per-connection MFA. When Jerry connects
to the database `prod-mysql-instance` (with label `env: prod`), he gets prompted
for an MFA check for each `tsh db connect` or `tsh proxy db` call:

```code
$ tsh db connect prod-mysql-instance
# Tap any security key

# Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
# Your MySQL connection id is 10002

```

## Limitations

Current limitations for this feature are:

- For SSH connections besides the Web UI, the `tsh` or Teleport Connect client must be used for per-session MFA.
  (The OpenSSH `ssh` client does not work with per-session MFA).
- Only `kubectl` supports per-session WebAuthn authentication for Kubernetes.
- Database access with per-session MFA only works with `tsh db connect` or `tsh proxy db --tunnel`.
  Per-session MFA for databases is not supported in Teleport Connect.
- Application access clients don't support per-session MFA
  authentication yet, although cluster and role configuration applies to them.
  If you enable per-session MFA checks cluster-wide, you will not be able to
  use Application access. We're working on integrating per-session
  MFA checks for these clients.
- For desktop access, only WebAuthn devices are supported.
