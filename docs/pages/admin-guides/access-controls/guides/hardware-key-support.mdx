## Introduction

<Admonition type="warning" title="Enterprise">
  Hardware Key Support requires Teleport Enterprise.
</Admonition>

By default, `tsh`, Teleport Connect, and other Teleport clients store a user's key and certificates directly
on their filesystem. If a user's filesystem is compromised, any of their active Teleport user keys and certificates
would also be compromised.

You can configure [per-session MFA](per-session-mfa.mdx) to require a multi-factor authentication check 
when users start new sessions with Teleport services, such as the SSH Service, Kubernetes Service, Database Service, and so on. 
However, per-session MFA doesn't prevent compromised session credentials from taking other actions, such as 
running administrative commands with `tctl`. 

To prevent these types of attacks, Teleport supports hardware-based private keys. 
Unlike disk-based private keys, hardware-based private keys are generated and stored directly 
on a hardware device and are impossible to export. 
With hardware-based private keys, a login session is only functional if there's also access to the 
hardware device where the key was generated and stored.

Additionally, you can configure this feature to require a touch for every Teleport request, including non-session requests
like `tctl edit`. With touch required, hardware key support provides better security than per-session MFA.

<Admonition type="note" title="touch caching">
  A user's touch is cached on the hardware security key for 15 seconds to prevent excessive touch prompts.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Compatibility">
  Hardware key support provides the best security available. However, not all services are compatible with hardware keys.
  
  Supported:
    
    - Teleport clients `tsh`, `tctl`, and Teleport Connect.
    - Standard Teleport API requests such as `tsh ls`, `tctl create`, and so on.
    - Server access.
    - Agentless OpenSSH server access.
    - Database access with `tsh proxy db` instead of `tsh db connect`.
    - Kubernetes access with `tsh proxy kube` instead of `tsh kube login`.
    - Teleport Web UI
      - Web sessions are not backed by a hardware key directly, but they are strictly guarded by the
      Auth/Proxy services. Therefore, web sessions are given permission to bypass hardware key support
      and fallback to MFA prompts when user presence or verification is needed, like for per-session MFA.

  Not supported:
  
    - Desktop access.
    - Application access.
    - Legacy OpenSSH server access

  If you require users to have a hardware key to access your infrastructure, they won't be able to
  use any of the unsupported features either because the hardware key can't be accessed or because
  the protocol only supports raw private keys.

  To navigate these incompatibilities, we recommend that you enable hardware key support only when
  necessary, such as for roles with access to critical infrastructure. These roles can be accessed
  as needed with Access Requests so that users can avoid these issues for their normal login
  sessions.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A series 5+ YubiKey

<Admonition type="note" title="PIV support">
  Hardware key support requires users to use a PIV-compatible hardware key.
  Currently, this feature is only guaranteed to support YubiKey series 5+.
</Admonition>

- Install a smart card driver for you operating system. Teleport clients will connect to your YubiKey through the smart card driver to generate keys and perform cryptographic operations.
  - MacOS and Windows both ship with smart card drivers.
    - If you run into problems on Windows, try the official [YubiKey Smart Card Minidriver](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/smart-card-drivers-tools/).
  - On Linux distributions, download the [YubiKey Manager or Yubico PIV tool](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/smart-card-drivers-tools/), which both include the Linux smart card driver as a dependency. 
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/2. Enforce hardware key support

Hardware key support is not required by default. 

There are three primary options for hardware key support:
  - `hardware_key`: User keys are stored on their hardware key without touch/PIN protection. A separate MFA check is used for
  sessions and other MFA-reliant features, like moderated sessions.
  - `hardware_key_touch`: User keys are stored on their hardware key with touch protection. On each request, users  must touch their hardware key.
  - `hardware_key_touch_and_pin`: User keys will be stored on their hardware key with touch and PIN protection. On each request, users must touch their hardware key and enter their PIV pin.
    - Users who have not set a PIV code are prompted to set it during login.

You can enforce hardware key support for specific roles, as shown here:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: admin
spec:
  options:
    require_session_mfa: hardware_key_touch
```

You can also enforce hardware key support cluster-wide by updating your Teleport configuration:

```code
$ tctl edit cap
```

Set the value of `spec.require_session_mfa` to `hardware_key_touch`:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  ...
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  ...
  require_session_mfa: hardware_key_touch
  ...
version: v2
```

After you save and exit the editor, `tctl` updates the resource:

```text
cluster auth preference has been updated
```

## Step 2/2. Log in

After you configure a role or cluster to require a hardware key, all users signing in with that 
role or to that cluster must use their hardware key for all Teleport requests.

Affected users will be prompted to connect and touch their YubiKey to sign in. 
The first time users sign in with their hardware key they might be required to immediately sign in again.

Affected users with existing sessions that aren't backed by a hardware key are prompted to sign in again
on their next request. For example:

```code
$ tsh clusters
# Unmet private key policy "hardware_key_touch"
# Relogging in with hardware-backed private key.
# Enter password for Teleport user dev:
# Tap your YubiKey
# Cluster Name Status Cluster Type Labels Selected 
# ----------- ------ ------------ ------ -------- 
# example.com online root                *        
```

## Custom PIV setup

### Custom PIV Slot

By default, Teleport clients use the following PIV slots for each option:
  - `hardware_key`: slot `9a`
  - `hardware_key_touch`: slot `9c`
  - `hardware_key_touch_and_pin`: slot `9d`
  - `hardware_key_pin`: slot `9e`

If you are using any other PIV applications, you might need to specify a different slot.
For example, `yubikey-agent` uses slot `9a`. To avoid overwriting the `yubikey-agent` key and certificate,
a user with the `hardware_key` requirement would need to specify a different slot.

During login, users can specify a PIV slot using the `--piv-slot` command-line option or an environment variable.
For example:
  - `tsh login --piv-slot=9c`
  - `TELEPORT_PIV_SLOT=9c tsh login`

The PIV slot can also be set cluster-wide with a configuration option:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  ...
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  ...
  require_session_mfa: hardware_key
  hardware_key:
    piv_slot: 9c
  ...
version: v2
```

### Custom Key

Teleport clients generate keys in the slots specified using the default management key.

If your PIV key uses a different management key, you must generate the key yourself.
This can be done with the [YubiKey Manager CLI](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/):

`ykman piv keys generate -a ECCP256 [slot] --touch-policy=[never|cached|always] --pin-policy=[never|once|always] -`

After running this command, you're prompted to enter your management key to complete the request. 
Make sure that the touch and PIN policy satisfy the hardware key requirement for your cluster and roles.

## Troubleshooting

### `ERROR: private key policy not met`

This error is returned by the Auth and Proxy services if a user does not meet the required private key policy. 
Both `tsh` and Teleport Connect automatically catch these errors and require the user to sign in again with a valid hardware-based private key. 

### `ERROR: authenticating with management key: auth challenge: smart card error 6982: security status not satisfied`

Smart card auth challenge errors can appear when the wrong management key is used.

Teleport clients expect a fresh PIV key with the default management key. 
You can reset this key, along with any existing PIV keys and certificates, with the 
[YubiKey Manager CLI](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/) `ykman piv reset`.

If you want to use a different management key, follow the [custom PIV setup instructions](#custom-piv-setup).

### `ERROR: ssh: handshake failed: command failed: transmitting request: an attempt was made to end a non-existent transaction`

Sometimes, PIV interactions with your Yubikey can fail in unexpected ways.

For example, if you tap your Yubikey for MFA and then subsequently tap your
Yubikey for Hardware Key support, you might get an error on rare occasions.

### Why am I being asked to tap several times to login?

Depending on your settings, you might be asked to tap your Yubikey many times.
Each tap is necessary to safely authenticate you.

For example, if you have `second_factor: webauthn` set in your `cluster_auth_preference`, 
and `require_session_mfa: hardware_key_touch` set on your role,
you'll see the following output when you first sign in:

```code
$ tsh login --user=dev --proxy=root.example.com:3080

# First login as usual, as the unauthenticated client has no way of inferring
# that "hardware_key_touch" is required by the user's role.

Enter password for Teleport user dev:
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap

# Login results in a "hardware_key_touch" error.

Unmet private key policy "hardware_key_touch".

# At this point, `tsh` can infer from the error that the user's role requires 
# "hardware_key_touch", so it generates a private key directly on the hardware key
# with a tap and re-initiates the sign in process.

Relogging in with hardware-backed private key.

# This time, `tsh` uses the Yubikey-backed private key in the login request to
# get certificates which pass the private key policy for the user's role.

Enter password for Teleport user dev:
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap
Tap your YubiKey
> Profile URL:        https://root.example.com:3080
  Logged in as:       dev
  Cluster:            root.example.com
