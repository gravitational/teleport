Teleport allows multiple users to join the same SSH or `kubectl exec` session.
Session joining can be performed via the web UI's Active Sessions page, or by
using the `tsh join` command.

## Participant modes

When joining a session, users can be in one of three participant modes:

- **Observer**: Can only view the session.
- **Peer**: Can view the session and interact with it as if they were the session owner.
- **Moderator**: (Enterprise only) Can view the session and terminate it.

Users can join SSH sessions from the command line or from the Teleport web UI,
but Kubernetes sessions can only be joined from the command line.

The web UI forces users to select a join mode prior to joining. If you join a
session with `tsh join` or `tsh kube join`, you can specify a participant mode
with the `--mode <mode>` command-line option, where `<mode>` is `peer`,
`moderator`, or `observer`. The default participant mode is `observer`.

You can leave a session with the shortcut `^c` (Control + c) while in observer or
moderator mode. In moderator mode, you can also forcefully terminate the session
at any point in time by pressing `t`.

## Access controls

You can use the `join_sessions` field of a role to specify the sessions users
can join and under what conditions they can join a session. For example, the
following role allows users to join both SSH and Kubernetes sessions started by
users with the `prod-access` role and to join the session as a moderator or an
observer:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: allow-session-join
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    join_sessions:
      - name: Join prod sessions
        roles : ['prod-access']
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator', 'observer']
```

Users who are assigned a role with a `join_sessions` allow policy are
implicitly allowed to list the sessions that the policy gives them permission
to join. If there's a `deny` rule that prevents listing sessions, the
`join_sessions` policy overrides the `deny` rule for the sessions the
policy allows the user to join. Outside of this exception for joining
sessions, `deny` statements take precedent.

The following are required fields for `join_sessions`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`name`|String|The name of the allow policy.|
|`roles`|List|A list of Teleport role names that the allow policy applies to. Active sessions created by users with these roles can be joined under this policy.|
|`kinds`|List|The kind of sessions—SSH, Kubernetes, or both—that the allow policy applies to. The valid options are `ssh` and `k8s`.|
|`modes`|List|The participant mode—`observer`, `moderator`, or `peer`—that the user joining the session can use to join the session. The default mode is `observer`.|

If you want to allow users to list active sessions without giving them
permission to join these sessions, you can grant them `list` permissions on the
`session_tracker` resource.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: list-active-sessions
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: [ session_tracker ]
        verbs: [ list ]
```

Teleport also supports explicit deny rules on the `ssh_session` resource for compatibility
with legacy Teleport roles, but we do not encourage the use of the `ssh_session` resource
in new roles.

## Moderated sessions

In Teleport Enterprise, you can configure roles to require that sessions are joined
by 1 or more additional participants before they are allowed to start. Sessions that
require additional participants are called moderated sessions.

The most common use cases for moderated sessions involve the following scenarios:

- You have strict security or compliance requirements and need to have people watching
  over user-initiated sessions on a set of servers.
- You need the ability to pause or terminate active sessions.

### Example

In the following example, Jeff's role requires additional participants before it can start.

```code
$ tsh ssh ubuntu@prod.teleport.example.com
Teleport > Creating session with ID: 46e2af03-62d6-4e07-a886-43fe741ca044...
Teleport > Controls
  - CTRL-C: Leave the session
  - t: Forcefully terminate the session (moderators only)
Teleport > User jeff joined the session.
Teleport > Waiting for required participants...
```

Jeff's session is paused, waiting for the required participants. When Alice, who is
assigned the `auditor` role, joins the waiting session as a moderator, the
session can begin. For example:

```code
$ tsh join --mode=moderator 46e2af03-62d6-4e07-a886-43fe741ca044
Teleport > Creating session with ID: 46e2af03-62d6-4e07-a886-43fe741ca044...
Teleport > Controls
  - CTRL-C: Leave the session
  - t: Forcefully terminate the session (moderators only)
Teleport > User jeff joined the session.
Teleport > Waiting for required participants...
Teleport > User alice joined the session.
Teleport > Connecting to prod.teleport.example.com over SSH

ubuntu@prod.teleport.example.com %
```

Because this session is an SSH session, Alice could also join from the
Teleport Web UI. For example:

### Access controls

Moderated sessions are configured via the `require_session_join` section of a
role. This section defines the conditions that must be met for a session to
start or run. For example, the following policy specifies that users assigned
the `prod-access` role must have a minimum of one user with the `auditor` role
present in the `moderator` mode to start SSH or Kubernetes sessions:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: prod-access
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    require_session_join:
      - name: Require one moderator
        filter: 'contains(user.spec.roles, "auditor")'
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator']
        count: 1
    logins: [ ubuntu, debian ]
    node_labels: { env: prod }
    kubernetes_labels: { env: prod }
    kubernetes_groups: [ prod-access ]
    kubernetes_users: [ USER ]
    kubernetes_resources:
    - kind: '*'
      name: '*'
      namespace: '*'
      verbs: ['*']
```

The `require_session_join` rules apply to all of the user's sessions, including
those that are accessible via other roles. If you do not want to require moderation
for user sessions, we recommend using Access Requests to temporarily assume a role
for resources that should require moderation.

The following are required fields for `require_session_join`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`name`|String|The name of the require policy|
|`filter`|Filter|An expression that, if it evaluates to true for a given user, enables the user to be present in a moderated session.|
|`kinds`|List|The kind of session—SSH, Kubernetes, or both—that the policy applies to. The valid options are `ssh` and `k8s`.|
|`modes`|List|The participant mode—`observer`, `moderator`, or `peer`—that the user joining the moderated session must match to satisfy the policy.|
|`count`|Integer|The minimum number of users that must join the session to satisfy the policy.|

The following fields are optional for `require_session_join`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`on_leave`|String|The action to take when the policy is no longer satisfied.|

You can use the `on_leave` field in require policies to define what happens
when a participant leaves a session and causes the policy to no longer be satisfied.
There are two possible values for this field:

- `terminate` to terminate the session immediately and disconnect all participants.
- `pause` to pause the session and stop any input/output streaming until the policy is satisfied again.

By default, Teleport treats an empty string in this field the same as `terminate`.

If all require policies attached to the session owner are set to `pause`, the
session discards all input from session participants and buffers the most recent
output but the session remains open so it can resume.

### Filter expressions

Filter expressions allow for more detailed control over the scope of a policy.
For example, you can use a filter expression to specify which users are required
to be present in a session. The filter has a `user` object as its context that
you can refine to match the `roles` and `name` fields you specify.

In the following example, the filter expression evaluates to true if the user's name is
`adam` or if the user has the role `cs-observe`:

```
equals(user.name, "adam") || contains(user.spec.roles, "cs-observe")
```

Filter expressions support the following functions and operators:

- `contains(set, item)`: Returns true if the item is in the set, otherwise
  false. The set can be a string or an array.
- `equals(a, b)`: Returns true if the two values are equal, otherwise returns
  false.
- `![expr]`: Negates a Boolean expression.
- `[expr] && [expr]`: Performs a logical AND on two Boolean expressions.
- `[expr] || [expr]`: Performs a logical OR on two Boolean expressions.

### Combining require policies and roles

In evaluating policies and roles, all of the require policies within a role are evaluated using an
OR operator and the policies from each role are evaluated using an AND operator. In practice, this
means that for every role with at least one require policy, one of its policies must be met before
a user assigned the role can start a session.

### Requiring moderated sessions in a leaf cluster

If you create a role with the `require_session_join` policy in a root cluster, only sessions started
on resources in the root cluster are required to be moderated for the users assigned that role.
If users assigned the role connect to resources in a leaf node, their sessions won't require moderation,
unless the mapped leaf role also requires moderation. To require moderated sessions in the leaf cluster,
you must include the `require_session_join` policy in the mapped role defined on the leaf cluster.

For more information about configuring trust relationships and role mapping between root and leaf
clusters, see [Configure Trusted Clusters](../../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx).

### Multifactor authentication

If per-session MFA is enabled then moderators who want to join a session will
need to satisfy the same MFA checks as if they were starting a session of their
own.

Teleport will also enforce additional presence checks for moderated sessions
when per-session MFA is required. Every 30 seconds, Teleport prompts session
moderators verify their presence by re-authenticating with their MFA device
within the next 15 seconds. This behavior continues throughout the session to
ensure that moderators are always present and watching a given session.

If no MFA input is received within 60 seconds, the moderator is disconnected
from the session, which might cause the session to terminate or pause because a
require policy is no longer satisfied.

### Session invites

When starting an interactive SSH or Kubernetes session using `tsh ssh` or `tsh kube exec`
respectively, you can supply the `--reason <reason>` or `--invited <users>` command-line
option to specify `<reason>` as a string or `<users>` as a comma-separated list of
user names.

This information is propagated to the `session_tracker` resource, which can be
used to with a third party, for example, to enable notifications over some
external communication system.

### File transfers

SFTP file transfers within moderated sessions are only supported when using the
Teleport Web UI. If the current active session requires moderation, file
transfer requests are automatically sent to all current session participants and
must be approved before the file transfer can begin.

Both the session originator and the moderator(s) must be present in the Teleport Web UI
during the file transfer initiation to receive the file transfer request notification.
After the file transfer has been requested, all session participants and notified
and prompted to approve or deny the file transfer request.

![Approve/Deny Prompt](../../../../img/moderated-file-transfer-dialog.png)

If a moderator denies the file transfer request, the request is immediately removed and
all session participants are notified.

After enough approvals have been given to satisfy the policy used to start the session,
the file transfer automatically begins.
