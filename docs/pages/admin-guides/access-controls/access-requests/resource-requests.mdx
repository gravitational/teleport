title: Resource Access Requests
description: Teleport allows users to request access to specific resources from the CLI or UI. Requests can be escalated via ChatOps or anywhere else via our flexible Authorization Workflow API.
tocDepth: 3
---

With Teleport Resource Access Requests, users can request access to specific
resources without needing to know anything about the roles or RBAC controls used
under the hood.
The Access Request API makes it easy to dynamically approve or deny these
requests.

Just-in-time Access Requests are a feature of Teleport Enterprise.
Teleport Community Edition users can get a preview of how Access Requests work by
requesting a role via the Teleport CLI. Full Access Request functionality,
including Resource Access Requests and an intuitive and searchable UI are
available in Teleport Enterprise.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/6. Grant roles to users

The built-in `requester` and `reviewer` roles have permissions to, respectively,
open and review Access Requests.  Grant the `requester` and `reviewer` roles to
existing users, or create new users to test this feature.  Make sure the
requester has a valid `login` so that they can view and access SSH nodes.

```code
$ tctl users add alice --roles requester --logins alice
$ tctl users add bob --roles reviewer
```

For the rest of the guide we will assume that the `requester` role has been
granted to a user named `alice` and the `reviewer` role has been granted to a
user named `bob`.

<Admonition type="tip">

Consider defining custom roles to limit the scope of a requester or reviewer's
permissions. Read the [Access Request
Configuration](./access-request-configuration.mdx) guide for available options.

</Admonition>

## Step 2/6. Search for resources

First, log in as `alice`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user alice
```

Notice that `tsh ls` returns an empty list, because `alice` does not have access to any resources by default.
```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address Labels
--------- ------- ------
```

Then try searching for all available ssh nodes.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738
bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f node        test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason <request reason>
```

You can search for resources of kind `node`, `kube_cluster`, `db`, `app`, and
`windows_desktop`. Teleport also supports searching and requesting access to
resources within Kubernetes clusters.

<details>
<summary>List of supported Kubernetes resources</summary>

Teleport supports searching and requesting access to the following Kubernetes resources:

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Resource Access Requests to Kubernetes Namespaces"
>

Requesting access to a Kubernetes namespace allows you to access all resources
in that namespace, including the supported Kubernetes resources listed below.
However, it prevents you from access any resources belonging to another namespace.

</Admonition>

- `pod`
- `secret`
- `configmap`
- `namespace`
- `service`
- `serviceaccount`
- `kube_node`
- `persistentvolume`
- `persistentvolumeclaim`
- `deployment`
- `replicaset`
- `statefulset`
- `daemonset`
- `clusterrole`
- `kube_role`
- `clusterrolebinding`
- `rolebinding`
- `cronjob`
- `job`
- `certificatesigningrequest`
- `ingress`


</details>

Advanced filters and queries are supported. See our
[filtering reference](../../../reference/cli/cli.mdx) for more information.

Try narrowing your search to a specific resource you want to access.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node --search iot
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 \
    --reason <request reason>
```

## Step 3/6. Request access to a resource

Copy the command output by `tsh request search` in the previous step, optionally filling in a request reason.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"
Creating request...

Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING

hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request

Waiting for request approval...

```

The command will automatically wait until the request is approved.

## Step 4/6. Approve the Access Request

First, log in as `bob`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user bob
```

Then list, review, and approve the Access Request.

```code
$ tsh request ls

```

<Admonition type="tip">

[Access Request Integrations](#integrating-with-an-external-tool)
to notify the right people about new Access Requests.
</Admonition>

## Step 5/6. Access the requested resource

`alice`'s `tsh request create` command should resolve now that the request has been approved.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"

Reason:     "responding to incident 123"
Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING

hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request

Waiting for request approval...

Approval received, getting updated certificates...

> Profile URL:        https://teleport.example.com
  Logged in as:       alice
  Active requests:    f406f5d8-3c2a-428f-8547-a1d091a4ddab
  Cluster:            teleport.example.com
  Roles:              access, requester
  Logins:             alice

  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

`alice` can now view and access the node.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address   Labels
--------- --------- ---------
iot       [::]:3022 test=test

$ tsh ssh alice@iot
iot:~ alice$
```

## Step 6/6. Resume regular access

While logged in with a Resource Access Request, users will be blocked from access to any other resources.
This is necessary because their certificate now contains an elevated role,
so it is restricted to only allow access to the resources they were specifically approved for.
Use the `tsh request drop` command to "drop" the request and resume regular access.

```code
$ tsh request drop
```

## Next Steps

### Automatically request access for SSH

Once you have configured Resource Access Requests,
`tsh ssh` is able to automatically create a Resource Access Request for you when access is denied,
allowing you to skip the `tsh request search` and `tsh request create` steps.

```code
$ tsh ssh alice@iot
ERROR: access denied to alice connecting to iot on cluster teleport.example.com

You do not currently have access to alice@iot, attempting to request access.

Enter request reason: please

```

### Restrict the resources a user can request access to

In this guide, we showed you how to enable a user to search for resources to
request access to. To do so, we assigned the user a Teleport role with the
`search_as_roles` field set to the preset `access` role.

You can impose further restrictions on the resources a user is allowed to
search by assigning `search_as_roles` to a more limited role. Below, we will
show you which permissions you must set to restrict a user's ability to search
for different resources.

To restrict access to a particular resource using a role similar to the ones
below, edit one of the user's roles so the `search_as_roles` field includes the
role you have created.

For full details on how to use Teleport roles to configure RBAC, see the
[Teleport Access Controls
Reference](../../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).

#### `node`

You can restrict access to searching `node` resources by assigning values to the
`node_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields. The following
role allows access to SSH Service instances with the `env:staging` label.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: staging-access
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: staging
    logins:
      - "{{internal.logins}}"
  options:
    # Only allows the requester to use this role for 1 hour from time of request.
    max_session_ttl: 1h
```

#### `kube_cluster`

You can restrict access to searching `kube_cluster` resources by assigning
values to the `kubernetes_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny`
fields.

The following role allows access to Kubernetes clusters with the `env:staging`
label:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      'env': 'staging'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: '*'
        namespace: '*'
        name: '*'
  deny: {}
```

#### Kubernetes resources

You can restrict access to Kubernetes resources by assigning values to the
`kubernetes_resources` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to Kubernetes pods with the name `nginx` in any
namespace, and all pods in the `dev` namespace:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*':'*'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "*"
        name: "nginx*"
      - kind: pod
        namespace: "dev"
        name: "*"
    kubernetes_groups:
      - viewers
  deny: {}
```

##### Preventing unintended access to Kubernetes resources

If you are setting up a Teleport role to enable just-in-time access to a
specific Kubernetes resources, you should set the role's `kubernetes_groups` and
`kubernetes_users` to a role that has no access to Kubernetes resource beside
the Kubernetes resources that Teleport is able to restrict access for.

This is because, if a user requests access to a Kubernetes pod, and the request
is approved, the Teleport Kubernetes Service will use the `kubernetes_groups`
and `kubernetes_users` fields in the role to add impersonation headers to the user's
requests to a Kubernetes API server. Under these conditions, Teleport will be able
to restrict access to all Kubernetes resources kinds mentioned above except for
the desired `pod`. Teleport is also able to restrict access to namespaced-scoped
custom resources but not cluster-scoped custom resources - CRDs resources that
are cluster-scoped will be accessible to the user if the principals in the
`kubernetes_users` and `kubernetes_groups` fields have access to them.

Requesting access to a Kubernetes Namespace allows you to access all resources
in that namespace but you won't be able to access any other supported resources
in the cluster.

##### Restrict Access Requests to specific Kubernetes resource kinds

<Admonition type="note">
The `request.kubernetes_resources` field was released in Teleport 16.4.7.
All Auth Service instances must be on version 16.4.7+ before the Kubernetes resource restrictions will be enforced.
</Admonition>

The `request.kubernetes_resources` field allows you to restrict what kinds of Kubernetes 
resources a user can request access to. Configuring this field to any value will disallow
requesting access to the entire Kubernetes cluster.

If the `request.kubernetes_resources` field is not configured, then a user can request access 
to any Kubernetes resources, including the entire Kubernetes cluster.

The following role allows users to request access to Kubernetes namespaces. 
Requests for Kubernetes resources other than `namespace` will not be allowed.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: requester-kube-access
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - "kube-access"
      kubernetes_resources:
        - kind: "namespace"
```

The following role allows users to request access only to Kubernetes namespaces and/or pods.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: requester-kube-access
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - "kube-access"
      kubernetes_resources:
        - kind: "namespace"
        - kind: "pod"
```

The following role allows users to request access to any specific Kubernetes resources.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: requester-kube-access
version: v7
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - "kube-access"
      kubernetes_resources:
        - kind: "*"
```

See related section about [Kubernetes Resources](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx#kubernetes_resources) 
to see a list of supported `kind` values.

The `request.kubernetes_resources` field only restricts what `kinds` of Kubernetes resource requests are allowed.
To control Kubernetes access to these resources see 
[Preventing unintended access to Kubernetes resources](#preventing-unintended-access-to-kubernetes-resources) 
section for more details.

#### `db`

You can restrict access to searching `db` resources by assigning values to the
`db_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to databases with the `environment:dev` or
`environment:stage` labels:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      environment: ["dev", "stage"]

    # Database account names this role can connect as.
    db_users: ["viewer", "editor"]
    db_names: ["*"]
```

#### `app`

You can restrict access to searching `app` resources by assigning values to the
`app_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to all applications except for those in
`env:prod`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      "*": "*"
  deny:
    app_labels:
      env: "prod"
```

#### `windows_desktop`

You can restrict access to searching `windows_desktop` resources by assigning
values to the `windows_desktop_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny`
fields.

The following role allows access to all Windows desktops with the
`environment:dev` or `environment:stage` labels.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      environment: ["dev", "stage"]

    windows_desktop_logins: ["{{internal.windows_logins}}"]
```

### Request access to Kubernetes resources

Teleport users can request access to a Kubernetes resources by running the following
command:

```code
$ tsh request create <Var name="resource-id" />
```

#### Namespace-scoped resources

For Kubernetes namespaced resources, the `resource-id` is in the following format:

```
/TELEPORT_CLUSTER/NAMESPACED_KIND/KUBE_CLUSTER/NAMESPACE/RESOURCE_NAME
```

Teleport supports the following namespaced resources: `pod`, `secret`, `configmap`,
`service`, `serviceaccount`, `persistentvolumeclaim`, `deployment`, `replicaset`,
`statefulset`, `daemonset`, `kube_role`, `rolebinding`, `cronjob`, `job`,
`ingress`.

For example, to request access to a pod called `nginx-1` in the `development`
namespace, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resources /teleport.example.com/pod/mycluster/development/nginx-1
```

For the `NAMESPACE` and `RESOURCE_NAME` values, you can match ranges of characters by
supplying a wildcard (`*`) or regular expression. Regular expressions must begin
with `^` and end with `$`.

For example, to create a request to access all pods in all namespaces that match
the regular expression `/^nginx-[a-z0-9-]+$/`, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resources /teleport.example.com/pod/mycluster/*/^nginx-[a-z0-9-]+$
```

#### Cluster-scoped resources

For Kubernetes cluster-scoped resources, the `resource-id` is in the following format:

```
/TELEPORT_CLUSTER/CLUSTER_WIDE_KIND/KUBE_CLUSTER/RESOURCE_NAME
```

Teleport supports the following cluster-wide resources: `namespace`, `kube_node`,
`clusterrole`, `clusterrolebinding`, `persistentvolume`, `certificatesigningrequest`.

For example, to request access to a namespace called `prod`, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resources /teleport.example.com/namespace/mycluster/prod
```

For the `RESOURCE_NAME` value, you can match ranges of characters by
supplying a wildcard (`*`) or regular expression. Regular expressions must begin
with `^` and end with `$`.

For example, to create a request to access all namespaces prefixed with `dev` match
the regular expression `/^dev-[a-z0-9-]+$/`, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resources /teleport.example.com/namespace/mycluster/^dev-[a-z0-9-]+$
```

Using cluster-scoped resource requests requires the role under `search_as_roles` to have the correct 
permissions for the cluster-scoped resource.  This is an example of the required permissions to
request access only to the namespace `prod` (and all resources within it):

```yaml
kind: role
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_resources:
    - kind: namespace
      name: prod
      verbs:
      - '*'
```

#### Search for Kubernetes resources

If a user has no access to a Kubernetes cluster, they can search the list of resources
in the cluster by running the following command:

```code
$ tsh request search --kind=<kind> --kube-cluster=<Var name="kube-cluster" /> \
[--kube-namespace=<Var name="namespace" />|--all-kube-namespaces]
Name               Namespace Labels    Resource ID
-----------------  --------- --------- ----------------------------------------------------------
nginx-deployment-0 default   app=nginx /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-0
nginx-deployment-1 default   app=nginx /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-1

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-0 --resource /teleport.example.com/pod/local/default/nginx-deployment-1 \
    --reason <request reason>
```

The list returned includes the name of the resource, the namespace it is in if
applicable, its labels, and the resource ID.
Resources included in the list are those that match the `kubernetes_resources`
field in the user's `search_as_roles`. The user can then:

- Request access to the resources by running the command provided by the `tsh request
search` command.
- Edit the command to request access to a subset of the resources.
- Use a custom request with wildcards or regular expressions.

`tsh request search --kind=<kind>` works even if the user has no permissions to interact
 with the desired Kubernetes cluster, but the user's `search_as_roles` values
must allow access to the cluster. If the user is unsure of the name of the cluster,
they can run the following command to search it:

```code
$ tsh request search --kind=kube_cluster
Name  Hostname Labels Resource ID
----- -------- ------ ----------------------------------------
local                 /teleport.example.com/kube_cluster/local

```

### Integrating with an external tool

With Teleport's Access Request plugins, users can manage Access Requests from
within your organization's existing messaging and project management solutions.
