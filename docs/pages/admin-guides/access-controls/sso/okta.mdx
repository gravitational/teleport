title: Authentication With Okta as an SSO Provider
description: How to configure Teleport access using Okta for SSO
videoBanner: SM4Am-i8cj4
---

This guide covers how to configure [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) to provide
single sign on (SSO) identities to Teleport Enterprise and Teleport Enterprise
Cloud. When used in combination with role-based access control (RBAC), this allows
Teleport administrators to define policies like:

- Only members of the "DBA" group can access PostgreSQL databases.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.
- Members of the HR group can view audit logs but not production environments.

<Details title="Automated SSO connection with Okta integration" open={false}>

In Teleport Enterprise Cloud and Self-Hosted Teleport Enterprise, Teleport can
automatically configure an SSO connector for you when as part of [enrolling the
hosted Okta integration](../../../enroll-resources/application-access/okta/okta.mdx).

You can enroll the Okta integration from the Teleport Web UI.

Visit the Teleport Web UI and find the dropdown menu on the upper left of the
screen. Select the **Management** option.

On the left sidebar, click **Enroll New Integration** to visit the "Enroll New
Integration" page:

![Enroll an Access Request plugin](../../../../img/enterprise/plugins/enroll.png)

On the "Select Integration Type" menu, click the Okta tile. Teleport will then
guide you through configuring the Okta integration.

## Prerequisites

- An Okta account with admin access. Your account must include users and at
  least two groups. If you don't already have Okta groups you want to assign to
  Teleport roles don't worry, we'll create example groups below.

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Teleport role with access to edit and maintain `saml` resources. This is
  available in the default `editor` role.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Teleport Enterprise (Self-Hosted)" scope="enterprise">
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl-tsh-prerequisite.mdx!)
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Teleport Cloud" scope="cloud">
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl-tsh-prerequisite.mdx!)
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 1/4. Create & assign groups

Okta indicates a user's group membership as a SAML assertion in the data it
provides to Teleport. We will configure Teleport to assign the "dev" role to
members of the `okta-dev` Okta group, and the prest "editor" role to members of
the `okta-admin` group.

If you already have Okta groups you want to assign to "dev" and "editor" roles in
Teleport, you can skip to the [next step](#step-24-configure-okta).

### Create Groups

Create two groups: "okta-dev" and "okta-admin". In the Okta dashboard go to the
navigation bar and click **Directory** -> **Groups**, then **Add group**:

![Create Group Devs](../../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-2.1@2x.png)

Repeat for the admin group:

![Create Group Devs](../../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-2.2.png)

## Step 2/4. Configure Okta

In this section we will create an application in the Okta dashboard to allow our
Teleport cluster to access Okta as an IdP provider. We'll also locate the
address that Okta uses to provides their IdP metadata to Teleport.

First, create a SAML 2.0 Web App in Okta:

From the main navigation menu, select **Applications** -> **Applications**, and click
**Create App Integration**. Select SAML 2.0, then click **Next**.

![Create APP](../../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-1.png)

On the next screen (**General Settings**), provide a name and optional logo for
your new app, then click **Next**. This will bring you to the **Configure SAML** section.

### Configure the App

Provide the following values to their respective fields:

#### General

- Single sign on URL: `https://<cluster-url>:<port>/v1/webapi/saml/acs/okta`
- Audience URI (SP Entity ID): <nobr>`https://<cluster-url>:<port>/v1/webapi/saml/acs/okta`</nobr>
- Name ID format `EmailAddress`
- Application username `Okta username`

Replace `<cluster-url>` with your Teleport Proxy Service address or Enterprise
Cloud tenant (e.g. `mytenant.teleport.sh`). Replace `<port>` with your Proxy
Service listening port (`443` by default).

#### Attribute Statements

- Name: `username`  | Name format: `Unspecified` | Value: `user.login`

#### Group Attribute Statements

We will map our Okta groups to SAML attribute statements (special signed metadata
exposed via a SAML XML response), so that Teleport can discover a user's group
membership and assign matching roles.

- Name: `groups` | Name format: `Unspecified`
- Filter: `Matches regex` |  `.*`

The configuration page should now look like this:

![Configure APP](../../../../img/sso/okta/setup-redirection.png)

<Admonition type="warning" >
The "Matches regex" filter requires the literal string `.*` in order to match all
content from the group attribute statement.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip">
Notice that we have set "NameID" to the email format and mapped the groups with
a wildcard regex in the Group Attribute statements. We have also set the "Audience"
and SSO URLs to the same value. This is so Teleport can read and use Okta users'
email addresses to create their usernames in Teleport, instead of relying on additional
name fields.
</Admonition>

Once you've filled the required fields, click **Next**, then finish the app creation wizard.

From the **Assignments** tab of the new application page, click **Assign**.
Assign the newly created groups access to the app.

![Configure APP](../../../../img/sso/okta/okta-saml-3.1.png)

### Save IdP metadata path

Okta provides an IdP metadata block, used by clients to identify and verify it
as a trusted source of user identity.

Since Okta serves this content over HTTPS we can configure Teleport to use this
path instead of a local copy, which can go stale.

From the app's **Sign On** tab, scroll down to **SAML Signing Certificates**.
Click **Actions** for the SHA-2 entry, then "View IdP metadata":

![View Okta IdP Metadata](../../../../img/sso/okta/okta-copy-metadata.png)

Copy the URL to the metadata file for use in our Teleport configuration.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can also right click on the "View IdP metadata" link and select
"Copy Link" or "Copy Link Address".
</Admonition>

## Step 3/4. Create a SAML connector

Define an Okta SAML connector using `tctl`. Update this example command with
the path to your metadata file, and edit the `--attributes-to-roles` values for
custom group assignment to roles. See [tctl sso configure
saml](../../../reference/cli/tctl.mdx) for a full reference of
flags for this command:

```code
$ tctl sso configure saml --preset=okta \
--entity-descriptor <Var name="https://example.okta.com/app/000000/sso/saml/metadata"/> \
--attributes-to-roles=groups,okta-admin,editor \
--attributes-to-roles=groups,okta-dev,dev > okta-connector.yaml
```

The contents of `okta-connector.yaml` should resemble the following:

```yaml
kind: saml
metadata:
  name: okta
spec:
  acs: https://teleport.example.com:443/v1/webapi/saml/acs/okta
  attributes_to_roles:
  - name: groups
    roles:
    - editor
    value: okta-admin
  - name: groups
    roles:
    - dev
    value: okta-dev
  audience: https://teleport.example.com:443/v1/webapi/saml/acs/okta
  cert: ""
  display: "Okta"
  entity_descriptor: ""
  entity_descriptor_url: https://example.okta.com/app/000000/sso/saml/metadata
  issuer: ""
  service_provider_issuer: https://teleport.example.com:443/v1/webapi/saml/acs/okta
  sso: ""
version: v2
```

The `attributes_to_roles` field in the connector resource maps key/value-like attributes of
the assertion from Okta into a list of Teleport roles to apply to the session.

(!docs/pages/includes/sso/idp-initiated.mdx!)

You can test the connector before applying it to your cluster. This is strongly
encouraged to avoid interruption to active clusters:

```code
$ cat okta-connector.yaml | tctl sso test
If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
 http://127.0.0.1:52519/0222b1ca...
Success! Logged in as: alice@example.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authentication details:
   roles:
   - editor
   - dev
   traits:
     groups:
     - Everyone
     - okta-admin
     - okta-dev
     username:
     - alice@example.com
   username: alice@example.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SAML] Attributes to roles:
- name: groups
  roles:

  value: okta-dev

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SAML] Attributes statements:
groups:
- Everyone
- okta-admin
- okta-dev
username:
- alice@example.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For more details repeat the command with --debug flag.
```

Create the connector using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create okta-connector.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/enterprise/samlauthentication.mdx!)

## Step 4/4. Create a developer Teleport role

Now let's create the Teleport role that we will assign to members of the
`okta-dev` group. Create the local file `dev.yaml` with the content below.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 24h
  allow:
    logins: [ "{{email.local(external.username)}}", ubuntu ]
    node_labels:
      access: relaxed
```

Members of this role have are assigned several attributes:

- they are only allowed to login to nodes labelled with `access: relaxed` label.
- they can log in as `ubuntu` user or a user matching their email prefix.
- they do not have any "allow rules" i.e. they will not be able to
  see/replay past sessions or re-configure the Teleport cluster.

Notice the `{{external.username}}` login. It configures Teleport to look at the
*"username"* Okta claim and use that field as an allowed login for each user.
This example uses email as the username format.  The
`email.local(external.username)` function call will remove the `@domain` and
leave the username prefix. For full details on how variable expansion works in
Teleport roles, see the [Teleport Zero Trust Access Controls
Reference](../../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).

Use `tctl` to create this role in the Teleport Auth Service:

```code
$ tctl create dev.yaml
```

We don't need to repeat this process for the "editor" role because this is a
preset role that is available by default in all Teleport clusters.

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

## Testing

The Web UI now contains a new "Okta" button at the login screen. To
authenticate via the `tsh` CLI, specify the Proxy Service address and `tsh` will
automatically use the default authentication type:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com
```

This command prints the SSO login URL (and will try to open it automatically
in a browser).

<Admonition  type="tip">
Teleport can use multiple SAML connectors. In this case a connector name
can be passed via the `--auth` flag. For the connector we created above:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --auth=okta
```

</Admonition>
