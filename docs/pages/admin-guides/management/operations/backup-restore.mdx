title: Backup and Restore
description: How to back up and restore your Teleport cluster state.
---

Operators must have a plan in place to back up self-hosted Teleport clusters.
While the Teleport Proxy Service and Teleport Agent services are stateless, you
should ensure that you can restore their configuration files. The Teleport Auth
Service manages state for the entire cluster, and it is critical that you can
back up its data. This guide explains the components of a Teleport Auth Service
deployment that must be backed up and lays out our recommended approach for
performing backups. 

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Data to back up

You must back up data that the Auth Service manages across its three backends:

- Cluster state backend
- Audit event backend
- Session recording backend

See [Storage Backends](../../../reference/backends.mdx) for more information on
Teleport backends.

The following table summarizes the kinds of backend data the Auth Service
maintains:

| What | Where |
| - | - |
| Local Users (not SSO) | Cluster state backend |
| Certificate Authorities | Cluster state backend |
| Dynamic resources ([more information below](#versioning-dynamic-resources-with-infrastructure-as-code)) | Cluster state backend |
| teleport.yaml | File system |
| teleport.service | File system |
| license.pem | File system |
| TLS key/certificate | File system or third-party service (e.g., AWS Certificate Manager)|
| Audit log | Audit event backend |
| Session recordings | Session recording backend |

## Backing up Teleport backends

Your plan for backing up the Teleport cluster state and session recording
backends depends on the solution you use for each backend. The following table
includes instructions for backing up each backend solution. For backends not
listed here, consult the documentation for your backend:

### Cluster state and audit event backends

For the most part, you can use the same solution for both cluster state and
audit events, setting aside a separate table for each kind of backend. The
exception is etcd, which can only function as a cluster state backend. (See a
full explanation in [Storage Backends](../../../reference/backends.mdx#etcd).)

| Local Filesystem | Back up the data directory (`/var/lib/teleport/` by default) |
| DynamoDB | [Amazon DynamoDB documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Backup-and-Restore.html) |

### Session recording backends

## Versioning dynamic resources with infrastructure as code

Teleport uses [dynamic
resources](../../infrastructure-as-code/infrastructure-as-code.mdx) for roles,
local users, authentication connectors, and other configurations, and stores
dynamic resource data on the cluster state backend. Backing up the cluster
state backend protects your cluster against the loss of dynamic resource data.

For more control over the version of a dynamic resource that you back up and
restore, we recommend storing dynamic resource manifests in a code repository
that uses a version control system. You can use a continuous deployment pipeline
to apply configurations automatically, so your Teleport cluster always reflects
the latest state of your dynamic resources. 

If you need to revert to an earlier version of a resource (e.g., to correct a
misconfiguration), you can restore the resource on your code repository without
conducting a full restore of the cluster state backend.

Teleport provides the following infrastructure as code tools for managing
dynamic resources:

- [Terraform
  provider](../../infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx)
- [Kubernetes
  operator](../../infrastructure-as-code/teleport-operator/teleport-operator.mdx)

## Cloning a backend

You can clone a Teleport Auth Service backend by instructing Teleport to
retrieve all items from one backend and store them in another backend. You can
use this operation to, for example, migrate data to a new backend or back up
data from one region to another. 

This operation uses the `teleport backend clone` command with a configuration
file that includes information about the source and destination backends. The
`teleport` process running the clone must have access to credentials for both
backends. If you complete the instructions below on a virtual machine or
Kubernetes pod that usually runs the Teleport Auth Service, you can expect the
`teleport` process to have the required permissions.

1. Write a configuration file for the clone. Create a file called `clone.yaml`
   that includes the following structure:

   ```yaml
     # src is the configuration for the backend where data is cloned from.
     src: 
       type: dynamodb
       region: us-east-1
       table: teleport_backend
     # dst is the configuration for the backend where data is cloned to.
     dst:
       type: sqlite
       path: /var/lib/teleport_data
     # parallel is the amount of backend data cloned in parallel.
     # If a clone operation is taking too long consider increasing this value.
     parallel: 100
     # force, if set to true, will continue cloning data to a destination
     # regardless of whether data is already present. By default this is false
     # to protect against overwriting the data of an existing Teleport cluster.
     force: false
   ```

   This example clones backend data in Amazon DynamoDB to a SQLite database.

1. Update the `src` and `dst` sections of the clone configuration file to
   include information about the source and destination backends. Possible
   values of `src` and `dst` are the same as the `teleport.storage` section in
   the Teleport configuration file. See the [Storage
   Backends](../../../reference/backends.mdx) reference for the configuration
   fields to assign for each backend.

1. Run the following command on an Auth Service instance to execute the clone
   operation. The value of the `-c` flag is the configuration file you created
   earlier:
   
   ```code
   $ sudo teleport backend clone -c clone.yaml
   ```

You can run the `teleport backend clone` command on an Auth Service instance
without stopping your cluster. The command retrieves each item from the source
backend and writes it to the destination backend. Any items created on the
source backend after the initial retrieval will not be included in the clone.
