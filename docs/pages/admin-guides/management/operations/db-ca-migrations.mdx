title: Database CA Migrations
description: How to complete Teleport Database CA migrations.
---

In Teleport, self-hosted databases must be configured with certificates to
enable mTLS authentication via the Teleport Database Service.

Teleport (= db_ca.released_version =) introduced the `db` certificate
authority (CA) to decouple CA rotation for self-hosted databases from the rest of
the Teleport cluster.

Teleport (= db_client_ca.released_version.v15 =) introduced the `db_client` CA
to split the responsibilities of the Teleport `db` CA, which was acting as both
host and client CA for Teleport self-hosted database access.
The `db_client` CA was also added as a patch in Teleport
(= db_client_ca.released_version.v13 =) and
(= db_client_ca.released_version.v14 =).

The `db` and `db_client` CAs were both introduced as an automatic migration
that occurs after upgrading Teleport.

Teleport's host/client database CA split is intended to limit the potential for
lateral movement to other resources in the event that a database instance's
private key is compromised.

This guide will provide information about why these CAs were added to Teleport
and how to complete any pending migrations for your Teleport cluster.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A Teleport cluster that was upgraded from a version that predates either the
  `db` or `db_client` CA.
  If your Teleport cluster was created in Teleport
  (= db_client_ca.released_version.v15 =) or later, then this guide does
  not apply to your cluster, because your `db` and `db_client` CAs were not
  migrated.

## Teleport `db` CA migration

Your Teleport cluster's `db` CA can be used to issue certificates to self-hosted
databases.
This is convenient, because the Teleport Database Service trusts certificates
issued by the `db` CA by default, so there is no additional TLS configuration
in Teleport required.

Alternatively, you can issue certificates to your self-hosted databases using
an external CA - you just need to configure the Teleport Database Service to
trust that CA when connecting to your database(s).

<Details title="How to make Teleport trust an external database CA?">
For a static database defined in your Teleport Database Service `teleport.yaml`
configuration file, set `tls.ca_cert_file` to a file containing your CA's root
certificate.

For a dynamic database, put your CA's root certificate in `spec.tls.ca_cert`. 

For examples and more information, consult the
[Database Access Configuration Reference](../../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/configuration.mdx).
</Details>

Prior to Teleport (= db_ca.released_version =), the Teleport `host` CA was used
to issue certificates to self-hosted databases (via `tctl auth sign`).
The `db` CA was introduced to decouple self-hosted database CA rotation
from the rest of your Teleport cluster.
The idea is that you should be able to rotate the CA used for self-hosted
databases without affecting other resources connected to your cluster.
Likewise, when you rotate your cluster's `host` CA, you should not have to worry
about affecting self-hosted databases.

To avoid breaking database access after upgrading to Teleport
(= db_ca.released_version =), Teleport clusters are automatically migrated to
create the `db` CA as a copy of the `host` CA.

If your cluster was upgraded to Teleport (= db_ca.released_version =) and you
use Teleport to issue certificates to your self-hosted databases, then you
should ensure that you have completed the `db` CA migration.
Otherwise, if you later rotate just one CA for any reason, a copy of the old CA
will still exist.
While this does not necessarily lead to a vulnerability in your cluster, it is
bad security practice to keep an old CA around after rotating it.

To complete the `db` CA migration:
- we recommend rotating your `host` CA
- we **strongly recommend** rotating your `db` CA

## Teleport `db_client` CA migration

The Teleport Database Service needs to authenticate itself to self-hosted
database(s) using a client certificate, which requires that you configure your
database(s) to trust Teleport's `db_client` CA.
Prior to the introduction of the `db_client` CA, self-hosted databases had to be
configured to trust the Teleport `db` CA for client authentication.

With the old approach - trusting the `db` CA for client connections - if a
database's private key is compromised, and a `db` certificate was issued for
that key, then it could be used to gain access to other databases.

Not all self-hosted databases are vulnerable to lateral movement after a private
key  compromise.
For example, MySQL and PostgreSQL both verify that a client's certificate
subject matches the client's database user.
Other databases only verify that a client's certificate is trusted, but do not
match the certificate subject to the database username.
For example, Cassandra, ScyllaDB, and Redis do not verify the client cert
subject.
All of these databases can be configured to require password authentication
after a successful mTLS handshake.
However, for defense in depth, these databases should only mTLS handshake with
a client that presents a `db_client` CA-issued certificate.

If your Teleport cluster was upgraded to Teleport
\>=(= db_client_ca.released_version.v13 =),
\>=(= db_client_ca.released_version.v14 =), or
\>=(= db_client_ca.released_version.v15 =),
then you should ensure that you have completed the `db_client` migration.
To complete the `db_client` CA migration:
- we recommend rotating your `db` CA
- we **strongly recommend** rotating your `db_client` CA.
- we **strongly recommend** reconfiguring your databases' certificates after
  you complete the `db_client` CA rotation.

<Admonition type="note" title="reconfiguring certs after db_client CA rotation">
  If you use `tctl auth sign` to reconfigure a database's certificates during
  a `db_client` CA rotation, then the trusted certificate output will include
  both the old and the new CA certificates.
  To complete the migration, you should reconfigure those databases again after
  the rotation - that way they will only trust the new CA.
 
  If you don't want to reconfigure each database both during and after the
  `db_client` CA rotation, and you do not mind temporarily losing connectivity
  to your databases via Teleport, then you can just complete the `db_client` CA
  rotation and reconfigure your databases afterward.
</Admonition>

## 1/2. Check for Teleport CA migrations

If you upgraded an existing cluster to Teleport
\>=(= db_ca.released_version =)
and you have not rotated *both* your `host` and `db` CAs at least once since
upgrading, then you should complete the `db` CA migration.

If you upgraded an existing cluster to Teleport
\>=(= db_client_ca.released_version.v13 =),
\>=(= db_client_ca.released_version.v14 =), or
\>=(= db_client_ca.released_version.v15 =)
and you have not rotated *both* your
`db` and `db_client` CAs at least once since upgrading, then you should complete
the `db_client` CA migration.

If you are unsure whether you need to complete the migration for either the `db`
or `db_client` CAs, you can check for duplicated CAs.
Use these commands to print the X.509 certificate serial number for your `host`,
`db`, and `db_client` CAs (in that order):

```code
$ tctl auth export --type=tls-host | openssl x509 -noout -serial
$ tctl auth export --type=db | openssl x509 -noout -serial
$ tctl auth export --type=db-client | openssl x509 -noout -serial
```

If the `db` CA serial number matches the `host` CA serial number, then you 
need to complete the `db` CA migration.

If the `db_client` CA serial number matches the `db` CA serial number, then you
need to complete the `db_client` CA migration.

## 2/2. Rotate CAs

If you need to complete both the `db` and `db_client` migrations, then a single
rotation of each of the `host`, `db`, and `db_client` CAs is enough: you do not
need to rotate the `db` CA twice.

If you need to rotate the `host` CA, we recommend completing that rotation
before starting either of the `db` or `db_client` CA rotations: do not rotate
other CAs in parallel with a `host` CA rotation.

Database CA rotations are a little different, because they involve configuring
external resources (self-hosted databases) with new certificates during the
rotation.
You can (and should) rotate the `db` and `db_client` CAs at the same time to
avoid repeating the database certificate reconfiguration steps.

For information about CA rotation, refer to the 
[CA Rotation Guide](./ca-rotation.mdx).
