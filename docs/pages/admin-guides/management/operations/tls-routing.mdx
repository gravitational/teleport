title: TLS Routing Migration
description: How to upgrade an existing Teleport cluster to single-port TLS routing mode
---

In TLS routing mode, all Teleport client connections are wrapped in TLS and
multiplexed on one Teleport Proxy Service port.

TLS routing has multiple benefits compared to the deployment where each protocol
is served on a separate port:

- Simpler network policy configurations since all clients connect to Teleport
  proxy over a single port.
- Communication between any client and Teleport proxy is authenticated by
  mutual TLS.
- Users are able to tunnel protocols that may normally be blocked on the
  internal network like SSH.

Upgrading Teleport will not enable TLS routing by default and the cluster will
keep working in backwards-compatibility mode. Follow this guide to migrate your
Teleport installation to TLS routing.

Teleport Enterprise Cloud manages the Proxy Service's networking configuration
for you. Get started with a [free
trial](https://goteleport.com/signup?t_source=docs) of Teleport Enterprise
Cloud.

## Prerequisites

Support for TLS routing behind layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancers and reverse
proxies is available starting from Teleport `13.0`.

If you use Teleport Cloud, see which ports and networking settings the Proxy
Service is configured to use in your Teleport Cloud tenant. Run the following
command, replacing `mytenant.teleport.sh` with your tenant address:

```code
$ curl https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.proxy'
```

## Step 1/7. Upgrade Teleport

Download Teleport from the [downloads page](https://goteleport.com/download) or
your enterprise portal and follow the standard [upgrade
procedure](../../../upgrading/upgrading.mdx). Make sure to upgrade both root and leaf clusters
as well as `tsh` client.

## Step 2/7. Enable proxy multiplexing

Update your root cluster Auth  Service's configuration to set proxy listener mode
to "multiplex":

```yaml
auth_service:
  proxy_listener_mode: multiplex
```

This setting will indicate to the clients (such as `tsh` or reverse tunnel
agents) that they should connect to the web proxy port using TLS routing.

<Admonition type="note" title="Compatibility">
  Turning multiplexing on will not affect existing connections of trusted
  clusters, reverse tunnel agents and tsh/ssh clients. As long as the legacy
  listeners are enabled (see [step 7](#step-77-disable-legacy-listeners) below),
  all clients will keep connecting in the backwards compatibility mode until
  restarted or relogged in/reconfigured in case of tsh/ssh as described below.
</Admonition>

## Step 3/7. Reconnect trusted clusters

If you're already multiplexing trusted cluster connections on the web proxy port
(i.e. `web_listen_addr` and `tunnel_listen_addr` have the same port in your
proxy configuration), you can skip this step.

Otherwise, update your trusted clusters to point both `web_proxy_addr` and
`tunnel_addr` to the root cluster's web proxy address and recreate them:

```yaml
kind: trusted_cluster
version: v2
metadata:
   name: "root"
spec:
   enabled: true
   web_proxy_addr: root.example.com:443
   tunnel_addr: root.example.com:443
   ...
```

## Step 4/7. Reconnect reverse tunnel agents

Restart all SSH, Kubernetes, application and database agents that connect to
the cluster's proxy over reverse tunnels.

This will make them reconnect to the cluster in TLS routing mode.

## Step 5/7. Relogin with tsh

Do `tsh logout` and log into the cluster with `tsh login` again to make sure
`tsh` starts using TLS routing mode.

## Step 6/7. Update OpenSSH config

If you're using OpenSSH client `ssh` with the config generated by `tsh config`
to connect to nodes within your Teleport cluster, you need to regenerate the
config.

Run `tsh config` command again so it generates SSH config compatible with SSH
routing setup. See our [OpenSSH guide](../../../enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh-agentless.mdx)
docs for reference.

## Step 7/7. Disable legacy listeners

At this point, all root cluster's clients connect to its web proxy port in TLS
routing mode. The final step is to instruct the Teleport proxy not to create
legacy listeners for SSH, reverse tunnels, Kubernetes and database clients by
default.

Add `version: v2` to your proxy's configuration and remove all listen addresses
except for `web_listen_addr`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  web_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:443
  ...
```

Config version `v2` will prevent other listeners from being created unless
they are explicitly set in the Proxy Service configuration.

## Rollback

To go back to the legacy separate listeners mode, perform the following steps:

1. Set `version: v1` in the proxy configuration and restart the proxy to make
   it create legacy listeners.
1. Set `proxy_listener_mode: separate` in the Auth Service configuration to make
   clients connect to the legacy listeners.
1. Reconnect all clients (trusted clusters, reverse tunnel agents, `tsh`) as
   described above.
1. If using OpenSSH client, regenerate SSH config using `tsh config` command.
