description: How to configure Teleport for large-scale deployments
---

This section explains the recommended configuration settings for large-scale
self-hosted deployments of Teleport.

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

- Teleport v(=teleport.version=) Open Source or Enterprise.

## Hardware recommendations

Set up Teleport with a [High Availability configuration](../../deploy-a-cluster/high-availability.mdx).

| Scenario                                                              | Max Recommended Count | Proxy Service         | Auth Service          | AWS Instance Types |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Teleport SSH Nodes connected to Auth Service                          | 10,000                | 2x  4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM  | 2x 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM  | m4.2xlarge         |
| Teleport SSH Nodes connected to Auth Service                          | 50,000                | 2x  4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM | 2x 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM  | m4.2xlarge         |
| Teleport SSH Nodes connected to Proxy Service through reverse tunnels | 10,000                | 2x 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM   | 2x 8 vCPUs, 16+GB RAM | m4.2xlarge         |

## Auth Service and Proxy Service Configuration

Upgrade Teleport's connection limits from the default connection limit of `15000`
to `65000`.

```yaml
# Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service
teleport:
  connection_limits:
    max_connections: 65000
```

## Agent configuration

Agents cache roles and other configuration locally in order to make access-control decisions quickly.
By default agents are fairly aggressive in trying to re-initialize their caches if they lose connectivity
to the Auth Service. In very large clusters, this can contribute to a "thundering herd" effect,
where control plane elements experience excess load immediately after restart. Setting the `max_backoff`
parameter to something in the 8-16 minute range can help mitigate this effect:

```yaml
teleport:
  cache:
    enabled: yes
    max_backoff: 12m
```

## Kernel parameters

Tweak Teleport's systemd unit parameters to allow a higher amount of open
files:

```txt
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65536
```

Verify that Teleport's process has high enough file limits:

```code
$ cat /proc/$(pidof teleport)/limits
# Limit                     Soft Limit           Hard Limit           Units
# Max open files            65536                65536                files
```

## DynamoDB configuration

When using Teleport with DynamoDB, we recommend using on-demand provisioning.
This allow DynamoDB to scale with cluster load.

For customers that can not use on-demand provisioning, we recommend at least
250 WCU and 100 RCU for 10k clusters.

## etcd

When using Teleport with etcd, we recommend you do the following.

- For performance, use the fastest SSDs available and ensure low-latency network connectivity
  between etcd peers. See the [etcd Hardware
  recommendations guide](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/hardware/) for more
  details.
- For debugging, ingest etcd's Prometheus metrics and visualize them over
  time using a dashboard. See the [etcd Metrics
  guide](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/metrics) for more
  details.

During an incident, we may ask you to run `etcdctl`, test that you can run the
following command successfully.

```code
etcdctl \
    --write-out=table \
    --cacert=/path/to/ca.cert \
    --cert=/path/to/cert \
    --key=/path/to/key.pem \
    --endpoints=127.0.0.1:2379 \
    endpoint status
```

## Supported Load

The tests below were performed against a Teleport Cloud tenant which runs on instances with 8 vCPU and 32 GiB memory and
has default limits of 4CPU and 4Gi memory.

### Concurrent Logins

| Resource Type | Login Command                          | Logins | Failure                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------|
| SSH           | tsh login                              | 2000   | Auth CPU Limits exceeded |
| Application   | tsh app login                          | 2000   | Auth CPU Limits exceeded |
| Database      | tsh db login                           | 2000   | Auth CPU Limits exceeded |
| Kubernetes    | tsh kube login && tsh kube credentials | 2000   | Auth CPU Limits exceeded |


### Sessions Per Second

| Resource Type | Sessions | Failure                   |
|---------------|----------|---------------------------|
| SSH           | 1000     | Auth CPU Limits exceeded  |
| Application   | 2500     | Proxy CPU Limits exceeded |
| Database      | 40       | Proxy CPU Limits exceeded |
| Kubernetes    | 50       | Proxy CPU Limits exceeded |

## Windows Desktop Service

Windows Desktop sessions can vary greatly in resource usage depending on the applications being used. The primary
factor affecting resource usage per session is how often the screen is updated. For example, a session playing a video
in full screen mode will consume significantly more resources than a session where the user is typing in a text editor.

We measured the resource usage of sessions playing fullscreen videos to get the worst-case estimate for resource requirements.
We then inferred resource requirements for more standard use cases on the basis of those measurements.

**Worst Case:**
- 1/12 vCPU per concurrent session
- 42 MB RAM per concurrent session

**Typical Case:**
- 1/240 vCPU per concurrent session
- 2 MB RAM per concurrent session

From these estimates we calculated the following table of recommendations based on the expected maximum number of concurrent
sessions:

| Concurrent users | CPU (vCPU, low to high) | Memory (GB, low to high) |
|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1                | 1                       | 0.5                      |
| 10               | 1                       | 0.5 to 1                 |
| 100              | 1 to 8                  | 1 to 8                   |
| 1000             | 4 to 96                 | 4 to 64                  |

To avoid service interruptions, we recommend leaning towards the higher end of the recommendations to start while monitoring
your resource usage, and then scaling resources based on measured outcomes.

Note that you are not limited to a single `windows_desktop_service`, and can connect multiple to your cluster in order to
spread resources out over multiple logical machines.
