title: Proxy Peering Migration
description: How to upgrade an existing Teleport cluster to Proxy Peering mode.
---

Proxy Peering enables Teleport Agents to be reachable without connecting to
every Teleport Proxy Service instance. This allows Proxy Service instances to
scale horizontally without increasing the number of connections created by
agents.

By default, Teleport Agents need to create a reverse tunnel to every Proxy
Service instance to ensure a client is able to reach every agent. With Proxy
Peering this is no longer a requirement. When Proxy Peering is enabled agents
will automatically change their behavior to connect to the configured number of
Proxy Service instances.

This guide shows you how to migrate your Teleport cluster to use Proxy Peering.

## How it works

A gRPC service on each Teleport Proxy Service instance provides an API for
establishing a bi-directional connection to the agents connected to that
instance. Proxy Service instances also manage a gRPC client to all other Proxy
Service instances in the cluster.

Routing information on which Proxy Service instances each agent is connected to
is stored in Teleport's backend and propagated to each Proxy Service instance.

The routing information and gRPC service allow a Proxy Service instance to
identify which peer instances an agent is connected to and create an
end-to-end connection from a client to that agent. This allows for access to the
agent without connecting to the same Proxy Service instance initially.

Agents check whether you have enabled Proxy Peering before attempting to create
a reverse tunnel to a Proxy Service instance. By default, in Proxy Peering mode,
agents are configured to connect to a single Proxy Service instance. For high
availability a cluster administrator may configure agents to connect to 2 or
more Proxy Service instances.

## Prerequisites

1. An existing self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster that is **not** using
   [Trusted
   Clusters](../../../admin-guides/management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx). See
   the documentation on [self-hosting
   Teleport](../../deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx) to get started.

1. A network architecture that meets the following DNS requirements: 

   * Teleport Proxy Service instances must be able to reach each other over the
     network on port `3021` by default. Ensure there are no firewall policies
     that would block communication between instances.
   * All Proxy Service instances must be available at a single domain. If
     clients in different networks must access the Teleport Proxy Service, the
     typical pattern is to use split DNS to resolve the same domain differently
     depending on the network.

## Step 1/3. Enable Proxy Peering

Update your cluster's Auth Service configuration to set the tunnel strategy type
to `proxy_peering`.

```yaml
auth_service:
    tunnel_strategy:
        type: proxy_peering
        agent_connection_count: 1
```

This setting will indicate to agents that they are only required to connect to 1
Teleport Proxy instance as specified by the `agent_connection_count` field.

For high availability, an `agent_connection_count` greater than 1 can be configured.
This ensures an agent is still reachable if one of the Proxy Service instances it is connected to is not available.

## Step 2/3. Restart the Auth Service

Restart all Teleport Auth Service instances running in the cluster to apply the
new Auth Service configuration.

## Step 3/3. Restart the Proxy Services

Restart all Teleport Proxy Service instances running in the cluster in order to
start the services required for Proxy Peering.
