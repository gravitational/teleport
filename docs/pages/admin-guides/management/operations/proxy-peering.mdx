title: Proxy Peering Migration
description: How to upgrade an existing Teleport cluster to Proxy Peering mode.
---

This guide shows you how to migrate your Teleport
cluster to use Proxy Peering, which enables you to scale
your Proxy Service instances horizontally by reducing the
number of connections created between Teleport Proxy instances
and Teleport services like the Database Service and Application Service.

## Prerequisites

An existing self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster. See the documentation on [self-hosting Teleport](../../deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx) to get started.

Teleport Proxy Service instances must be able to reach each other over the network on port
`3021` by default. Ensure there are no firewall policies that would block communication
between instances.

## Step 1/3. Enable Proxy Peering

Update your cluster's Auth Service configuration to set the tunnel strategy type
to `proxy_peering`.

```yaml
auth_service:
    tunnel_strategy:
        type: proxy_peering
        agent_connection_count: 1
```

This setting will indicate to agents that they are only required to connect to 1
Teleport Proxy instance as specified by the `agent_connection_count` field.

For high availability, an `agent_connection_count` greater than 1 can be configured.
This ensures an agent is still reachable if one of the Proxy Service instances it is connected to is not available.

## Step 2/3. Restart the Auth Service

Restart all Teleport Auth Service instances running in the cluster to apply the
new Auth Service configuration.

## Step 3/3. Restart the Proxy Services

Restart all Teleport Proxy Service instances running in the cluster in order to
start the services required for Proxy Peering.
