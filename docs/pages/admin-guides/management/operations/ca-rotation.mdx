description: Describes how to rotate Teleport's certificate authorities.
tocDepth: 3
---

Components of a Teleport cluster authenticate to one another using either X.509
or SSH certificates. To issue certificates, Teleport maintains several
certificate authorities. You can rotate Teleport CAs to prevent malicious actors
from impersonating part of your Teleport cluster. This guide explains the CAs
that Teleport maintains and how to rotate them.

We recommend becoming familiar with the entire guide before following the steps,
as you should be ready to roll back the CA rotation if it does not proceed as
expected.

## How it works

Teleport maintains its CAs independently of one another, and rotating one CA
does not affect the rotation status of the others. The rotation process is
designed to take place in **phases**, which give operators time to update their
infrastructure and roll back a CA rotation if necessary.

Teleport CA rotation takes place in five phases for each CA. The phases have the
following order:

1. `standby`: No rotation in progress. No operations have begun.
1. `init`: A new certificate authority is issued, but not used.
1. `update_clients`: The Teleport Auth Service uses the new CA to sign
   certificates but continues to trust certificates signed by the original CA.
1. `update_servers`: Teleport cluster components (Agents, Auth Service, and
   Proxy Service instances) reload and start serving TLS and SSH certificates
   signed by the new certificate authority, but still accept certificates issued
   by the original certificate authority. This only applies to the Teleport
   [`host` CA](#host).
   1. `standby`: No rotation in progress. All operations have completed.

Before the final `standby` phase, you can also put the rotation in the
`rollback` phase, aborting the rotation and returning to the original
certificate authority.

CA rotations can be **manual** or **semi-automatic**. In manual mode, admins
must instruct the Teleport Auth Service to advance from one phase to the next.
Between phases, admins can prepare their infrastructure to adjust to each
change. In semi-automatic mode, the Teleport Auth Service cycles through each
phase automatically, with a grace period between each phase.

## Step 1/4. Choose a CA to rotate

When rotating a CA, you need to check that any infrastructure that relies on the
CA has not lost connectivity. You may also need to export the new CA to your
infrastructure. Choose one of the CAs below to determine how to keep it up to
date during the migration.

We recommend rotating a single CA at a time in order to reduce complexity. The
exceptions are the `db` and `db_client` CAs, which must be rotated together.

|CA type|Certificate subjects|
|---|---|
|[`host`](#host)|Teleport Agents. Auth Service and Proxy Service instances.|
|[`user`](#user)|Teleport users.|
|[`db`](#db-and-db_client)|Self-hosted databases protected by Teleport (users must distribute certificates to databases).|
|[`db_client`](#db-and-db_client)|The Teleport Database Service.|
|[`openssh`](#openssh)|OpenSSH servers enrolled in your Teleport cluster.|
|[`jwt`](#jwt)|Teleport users accessing web applications.|
|[`saml_idp`](#saml_idp)|The Teleport SAML IdP.|
|[`oidc_idp`](#oidc_idp)|The Teleport OIDC IdP integration.|

### `host`

The `host` CA issues certificates to Teleport Agents as well as Auth Service and
Proxy Service instances so Teleport clients and the Teleport Auth Service can
verify them.

Teleport Agents and Proxy Service instances use **heartbeats** to periodically
report their status to the Teleport Auth Service and update their internal data
to reflect data held by the Auth Service. This internal data includes the status
of the `host` CA rotation if one is in progress.

To check the rotation status of an agent or Proxy Service instance, run a
variation of the following command:

```code
$ tctl get <Var name="resource" /> --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "in_progress",
  "phase": "init"
}
```

In this example, the Teleport instance named `terminal` has updated its status
to phase `init`. This means it has downloaded a new CA public key and is ready
for state transitions.

You can use the `tctl get` command with the following resources to determine
the rotation state of the `host` CA on each agent kind:

| Role                    | `tctl get` value          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Application Service     | `app_server`              |
| Database Service        | `db_server`               |
| Kubernetes Service      | `kube_server`             |
| Proxy Service           | `proxies`                 |
| SSH Service             | `nodes`                   |
| Windows Desktop Service | `windows_desktop_service` |

During each phase of the `host` CA rotation, make sure all Agents and Proxy
Service instances have completed the transition to target phase before
proceeding to the next phase. We will explain the phases in [Step
2](#step-24-start-a-manual-rotation).

If you are joining Teleport processes to a cluster via the Teleport Auth
Service, each Teleport process will need a CA pin to trust the Auth Service.
The CA pin will change after each `host` CA rotation. Make sure you use the
*new* CA pin when adding Teleport services after `host` CA rotation.

### `user`

The `user` CA issues a certificate when a user authenticates to Teleport. It
also signs client certificates for users connecting to Windows desktops and
Teleport SSH servers. Teleport-protected servers and Windows desktops use these
certificates.

Once you have completed the rotation and reached the final `standby` phase,
users who have signed into Teleport must reauthenticate to receive a user
certificate from the new CA, otherwise Teleport client commands fail.

If you have registered Windows desktops with Teleport, [follow the
guide](../../../enroll-resources/desktop-access/active-directory.mdx) to export
the Teleport user CA so the Windows Desktop Service can authenticate to RDP
hosts. Verify that you can connect to registered desktops throughout the
rotation.

### `db` and `db_client`

The `db` and `db_client` CAs issue certificates that the Teleport Database
Service uses to communicate with self-hosted databases. 

The Teleport Database Service presents a certificate signed by the `db_client`
CA when communicating with a self-hosted database, which an admin configures to
trust certificates issued by the CA. 

Admins can configure self-hosted databases to present a certificate signed by
the `db` CA, which the Database Service uses to verify that a database server is
a genuine Teleport-protected resource. Alternatively, self-hosted databases can
present a certificate signed by a custom CA, and admins can configure the
Teleport Database Service to trust the CA.

#### Beginning the rotation

The Teleport Database Service starts using client certificates issued by the new
CA to connect to databases at the `update_clients` phase. To avoid losing access
to your self-hosted databases in the `update_clients` phase, you should
reconfigure your databases in the `init` phase, then verify that you can still
access your databases after transitioning to the `update_clients` phase.

Consult the appropriate
[documentation](../../../enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx)
for configuring your databases before proceeding to the `update_clients`
rotation phase.

At the `init` phase, the `tctl auth sign` command differs between the `db` and
`db_client` CAs. If you rotate the `db_client` CA, the command outputs both the
original and new certificate authorities in its trusted CA output. If you rotate
the `db` CA, the command only issues the new database server certificates.  

You do not need to reconfigure databases in the `init` phase if you are rotating
only the `db` CA, although there is no harm in doing so. If you do not
reconfigure databases at this point, you must plan to do so at some point within
the rotation, otherwise you will lose access to these databases after
transitioning to the final `standby` phase.

#### Rolling back the rotation

The most common reason you would want to roll back is if you cannot reconfigure
your databases. If you have connectivity issues after reconfiguring a database,
it's likely that you misconfigured the database.

If you reconfigured any of your databases during the rotation, you will need
to reconfigure them again before transitioning to `standby` from the
`rollback` phase.

### `openssh`

The `openssh` CA issues certificates for [OpenSSH servers registered with
Teleport](../../../enroll-resources/server-access/openssh.mdx). Clients verify these certificates
when connecting to Teleport-protected OpenSSH servers.

If you used the [manual
method](../../../enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh-manual-install.mdx) to enroll any
OpenSSH servers, you must follow the instructions to export the `openssh` CA and
provide it to your OpenSSH servers before you transition the rotation to the
final `standby` phase. Otherwise, Teleport users will lose access to any OpenSSH
servers you enrolled in your cluster using the manual method.

### `jwt`

The Teleport Auth Service uses the `jwt` CA to sign JSON web tokens. The
Teleport Application Service includes JSON web tokens in HTTP messages that it
forwards to Teleport-protected applications, which use the `jwt` CA to verify
the tokens.

If you have enrolled web applications with Teleport, and those applications
authenticate traffic from the Teleport Application Service by verifying JSON web
tokens against the Teleport certificate authority, you need to ensure that these
applications continue to trust the rotated CA.

Teleport-protected JWT applications use one of two methods to retrieve the
public key of the Teleport `jwt` CA. Depending on the method, you may need to
take action after the `init` phase and before the rotation reaches the final
`standby` phase:

- **The application queries the `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint of the
  Teleport Proxy Service.** In this case, no action is required as long as the
  application can continue to access the endpoint. If the application caches
  `jwks.json`, invalidate the cache.
- **The application accesses the `jwks.json` file on the local filesystem**.
  Obtain a new `jwks.json` file by querying the `/.well-known/jwks.json`
  endpoint and re-uploading the file.

For an example of exporting the `jwt` CA so a web application can trust
Teleport-issued JWTs, see the guide to [using JWT authentication with
Elasticsearch](../../../enroll-resources/application-access/jwt/elasticsearch.mdx).

### `saml_idp`

The `saml_idp` CA signs SAML messages sent by the Teleport IdP so services that
rely on the Teleport IdP can verify them.

If you are rotating this CA, then before entering the final `standby` phase, you
must configure any service providers that rely on the Teleport SAML IdP to trust
the Teleport `saml_idp` CA. Follow the instructions in the [SAML IdP
documentation](../../access-controls/idps/saml-guide.mdx) to export an XML
metadata file and make it available to your service provider.

### `oidc_idp`

The `oidc_idp` CA signs messages sent by the Teleport OIDC IdP integration.
Relying parties (e.g., AWS) verify these messages to authenticate your Teleport
account for features like External Audit Storage, Auto-Discovery, and AWS Sync
for Access Graph. 

The Teleport Proxy Service serves the JSON Web Key Sets for the OIDC IdP
integration from the `/.well-known/jwks-oidc` path of the Web API.

The `/.well-known/jwks-oidc` path of the Teleport Proxy Service Web API is
always enabled. The Teleport Proxy Service updates the endpoint automatically.

You can retrieve the full URL of the integration's JSON Web Key Sets by querying
the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` path of the Web UI and reading the
`jwks_uri` field:

```code
$ curl https://example.teleport.sh/.well-known/open-id-configuration | jq '.jwks_uri'
"https://example.teleport.sh/.well-known-jwks-oidc"
```

## Step 2/4. Start a manual rotation

Once you have chosen a CA to rotate and have planned to check or update the
infrastructure that relies on that CA, you are ready to begin a manual rotation.

### `init` phase

In the `init` phase, the Teleport Auth Service issues a new certificate
authority of the chosen type, but does not use it to sign certificates. 

1. Initiate the manual rotation of host certificate authorities:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=init 
   Updated rotation phase to "init". To check status use 'tctl status'
   ```

1. Use `tctl` to confirm that there is an active rotation in progress. This
   command prints the rotation status of all CAs that the Teleport Auth Service
   maintains in your cluster:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl status
   Cluster       teleport.example.com
   Version       (=teleport.version=)
   host CA       initialized (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 2023 07:44:36 UTC)
   user CA       never updated
   db CA         never updated
   db_client CA  never updated
   openssh CA    never updated
   jwt CA        never updated
   saml_idp CA   never updated
   oidc_idp CA   never updated
   CA pin        sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```

1. Perform checks and updates on your infrastructure, depending on
   the CA type.

### `update_clients`

Execute the transition from `init` to `update_clients`. In this phase, The
Teleport Auth Service uses the new CA to sign certificates but continues to
trust certificates signed by the original CA.

1. Transition to the `update_clients` phase:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=update_clients
   # Updated rotation phase to "update_clients". To check status use 'tctl status'
   $ tctl status
   Cluster       teleport.example.com
   Version       (=teleport.version=)
   host CA       rotating clients (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 2023 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 2023 07:44:36 UTC)
   user CA       never updated
   db CA         never updated
   db_client CA  never updated
   openssh CA    never updated
   jwt CA        never updated
   saml_idp CA   never updated
   oidc_idp CA   never updated
   CA pin        sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```

1. Check or update infrastructure that depends on your CA before proceeding to
   the next step.

1. If you lose connectivity to your resources, see if you need to reconfigure
   them to accept the new CA. If that does not restore access or you are unable
   to reconfigure a database, then [roll back](#step-44-optional-roll-back-the-rotation) to the original
   certificate authority.

### `update_servers`

Initiate the `update_servers` phase. In this phase, Teleport cluster components
(Agents, Auth Service, and Proxy Service instances) reload and start serving TLS
and SSH certificates signed by the new certificate authority, but still accept
certificates issued by the original certificate authority. This phase only
affects the `host` CA.

1. Execute the transition:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=update_servers
   # Updated rotation phase to "update_servers". To check status use 'tctl status'
   
   $ tctl status
   Cluster       teleport.example.com
   Version       (=teleport.version=)
   host CA       rotating servers (mode: manual, started: Sep 20 2023 01:44:36 UTC, ending: Sep 21 2023 07:44:36 UTC)
   user CA       never updated
   db CA         never updated
   db_client CA  never updated
   openssh CA    never updated
   jwt CA        never updated
   saml_idp CA   never updated
   oidc_idp CA   never updated
   CA pin        sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```

1. Configure and check resources depending on the CA you are rotating. This is
   your final chance to update Teleport-protected resources before transitioning
   to the `standby` phase.

1. If you have lost connectivity to Teleport-protected resources, [roll
   back](#step-44-optional-roll-back-the-rotation) to the original certificate authority before entering the
   final `standby` phase, when rolling back is no longer possible.

### Final `standby`

Before wrapping up, verify that you have not lost access to Teleport-protected
resources that rely on the CA that you rotated.

1. Execute the transition:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=standby
   ```

1. Verify that the rotation has completed with `tctl`:

   ```code
   $ tctl status
   Cluster       teleport.example.com
   Version       (=teleport.version=)
   host CA       rotated Sep 20 2023 02:11:25 UTC
   user CA       never updated
   db CA         never updated
   db_client CA  never updated
   openssh CA    never updated
   jwt CA        never updated
   saml_idp CA   never updated
   oidc_idp CA   never updated
   CA pin        sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```

1. Follow the instructions for your CA to ensure that you can connect to
   Teleport-protected resources that rely on the CA that you rotated. This is
   the last stage where you have the opportunity to roll back. If you have lost
   connectivity to Teleport-protected resources, [roll back](#step-44-optional-roll-back-the-rotation) to the
   original certificate authority.

## Step 3/4. [Optional] Run a semi-automatic rotation

You can instruct Teleport to manage the CA rotation semi-automatically.
Semi-automatic rotation transitions between the phases of a rotation for you,
and there is no need to run a `tctl auth rotate` command each phase. After a
**grace period** elapses, the Teleport Auth Service updates the phase of the CA
rotation to the next step. 

### Determine whether to use a semi-automatic rotation

Aside from automatic phase updates, a semi-automatic rotation is identical to a
manual one. It is up to the operator to update any infrastructure to accommodate
the current phase before the grace period elapses.

Teleport does not check the status of any infrastructure that relies on the CA,
meaning that you can lose connectivity if things go wrong. As a result, you
**should not** carry out a semi-automatic rotation if you need to export a CA to
your infrastructure.

Complete a rotation in manual mode first to understand all the edge-cases and
hazards before attempting a semi-automatic rotation.

### Initiate a semi-automatic rotation

If you want to run a semi-automatic rotation, initiate it with `tctl` and
monitor the status of the rotation.

You can trigger semi-automatic rotation with the following command:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --type=<Var name="type" />
```

The command triggers a rotation process for hosts with a default grace period of
48 hours.

<Details title="Configuring the grace period">

You can customize grace period and CA type with additional flags:

```code
# Rotate only user certificates with a grace period of 200 hours:
$ tctl auth rotate --type=user --grace-period=200h

# Rotate only host certificates with a grace period of 8 hours:
$ tctl auth rotate --type=host --grace-period=8h
```

Be careful when choosing a grace period when rotating the `host` CA.

The grace period needs to be long enough for all Agents and Proxy Service
instances in a cluster to request a new certificate. If some hosts go offline
during the rotation and come back only after the grace period has ended, they
will be forced to leave the cluster.

</Details>

During semi-automatic rotations, Teleport attempts to divide the grace period so
that it spends an equal amount of time in each phase before transitioning to the
next phase. This means that using a shorter grace period will result in faster
state transitions.

## Step 4/4. [Optional] Roll back the rotation

You must perform a rollback before the rotation enters `standby` state.

1. Enter the rollback phase with a manual phase transition:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --phase=rollback --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --manual
   # Updated rotation phase to "rollback". To check status use 'tctl status'
   ```

1. Ensure that you can connect to Teleport resources that depend on the CA you
   were rotating.

1. Finish rolling back the CA rotation:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --phase=standby --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --manual
   # Updated rotation phase to "standby". To check status use 'tctl status'
   ```
