title: Certificate Authority Rotation
description: Describes how to rotate Teleport's certificate authorities.
tocDepth: 3
---

Components of a Teleport cluster authenticate to one another using either X.509
or SSH certificates. To issue certificates, Teleport maintains several
certificate authorities. You can rotate Teleport CAs to prevent malicious actors
from impersonating part of your Teleport cluster. This guide explains the CAs
that Teleport maintains and how to rotate them.

We recommend becoming familiar with the entire guide before following the steps,
as you should be ready to roll back the CA rotation if it does not proceed as
expected.

## How it works

Teleport maintains its CAs independently of one another, and rotating one CA
does not affect the rotation status of the others. The rotation process is
designed to take place in **phases**, which give operators time to update their
infrastructure and roll back a CA rotation if necessary.

Teleport CA rotation takes place in five phases for each CA. The phases have the
following order:

1. `standby`: No rotation in progress. No operations have begun.
1. `init`: A new certificate authority is issued, but not used.
1. `update_clients`: The Teleport Auth Service uses the new CA to sign
   new certificates but continues to trust certificates signed by the original CA.
1. `update_servers`: Any server components in the cluster that accept incoming
   connections from clients reload their identity and start serving certificates
   issued by the new CA.
   During this phase clients accept server certificates issued by the original
   CA or the new CA.
   When rotating the [`host` CA](#host) Teleport Agents, Auth Service and Proxy
   Service instances will automatically reload their identity.
   OpenSSH hosts must be issued new SSH host certificates during this phase.
1. `standby`: No rotation in progress. All operations have completed.
   All components will stop trusting the old CA and only trust the new CA.

Before the final `standby` phase, you can also put the rotation in the
`rollback` phase to abort the rotation return to the original certificate
authority.
After the `rollback` phase you will then proceed to the `standby` phase.

CA rotations can be **manual** or **semi-automatic**. In manual mode, admins
must instruct the Teleport Auth Service to advance from one phase to the next.
Between phases, admins can prepare their infrastructure to adjust to each
change. In semi-automatic mode, the Teleport Auth Service cycles through each
phase automatically, with a grace period between each phase.

In 17.0.5+ `tctl auth rotate` (with no arguments) starts an interactive
terminal UI for CA rotations.
The interactive UI displays a live cluster status, allows you to choose a CA to
rotate and guides you through each phase, automatically performs certain checks
to make sure the cluster is ready for the next phase, and lists any manual steps
that need to be completed.

## Step 1/4. Choose a CA to rotate

When rotating a CA, during each phase you should check that any infrastructure
that relies on the CA has not lost connectivity. You may also need to export the
new CA to your infrastructure, or issue new certificates to any self-hosted
services. Choose one of the CAs below to determine how to keep it up to date
during the migration.

|CA type|Certificate subjects|
|---|---|
|[`host`](#host)|Teleport Agents. Auth Service and Proxy Service instances.|
|[`user`](#user)|Teleport users.|
|[`db`](#db-and-db_client)|Self-hosted databases protected by Teleport (users must distribute certificates to databases).|
|[`db_client`](#db-and-db_client)|The Teleport Database Service.|
|[`openssh`](#openssh)|OpenSSH servers enrolled in your Teleport cluster.|
|[`jwt`](#jwt)|Teleport users accessing web applications.|
|[`saml_idp`](#saml_idp)|The Teleport SAML IdP.|
|[`spiffe`](#spiffe)|Workload Identity (SPIFFE) clients.|
|[`oidc_idp`](#oidc_idp)|The Teleport OIDC IdP integration.|

### `host`

The `host` CA issues certificates to Teleport Agents as well as Auth Service and
Proxy Service instances so Teleport clients and the Teleport Auth Service can
verify them.
The `host` CA also issues SSH host certificates to any enrolled agentless OpenSSH servers.

Teleport Agents and Proxy Service instances use **heartbeats** to periodically
report their status to the Teleport Auth Service and update their internal data
to reflect data held by the Auth Service. This internal data includes the status
of the `host` CA rotation if one is in progress.

To check the rotation status of an agent or Proxy Service instance, run a
variation of the following command, assigning <Var name="resource" /> to the
name of an agent or Proxy Service instance:

```code
$ tctl get <Var name="resource" /> --format=json | jq '.[] | {hostname: .spec.hostname, rotation: .spec.rotation.state, phase: .spec.rotation.phase}'
{
  "hostname": "terminal",
  "rotation": "in_progress",
  "phase": "init"
}
```

In this example, the Teleport instance named `terminal` has updated its status
to phase `init`. This means it has downloaded a new CA public key and is ready
for state transitions.

You can use the `tctl get` command with the following resources to determine
the rotation state of the `host` CA on each agent kind:

| Role                    | `tctl get` value          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Application Service     | `app_server`              |
| Auth Service            | `auth_server`             |
| Database Service        | `db_server`               |
| Kubernetes Service      | `kube_server`             |
| Proxy Service           | `proxies`                 |
| SSH Service             | `nodes`                   |
| Windows Desktop Service | `windows_desktop_service` |

During each phase of the `host` CA rotation, make sure all Agents and Proxy
Service instances have completed the transition to target phase before
proceeding to the next phase. We will explain the phases in [Step
2](#step-24-start-a-manual-rotation).

Any OpenSSH hosts must be issued new host certificates during the
`update_servers` phase of the `host` CA rotation.

Any Teleport processes that connect directly to the Auth Service need a CA pin
in order to trust the TLS certificate presented by the Auth Service.
This includes all Proxy Service instances and any agents in a self-hosted cluster that
connect directly to the Auth Service.
During the CA rotation, `tctl status` will report that there are 2 CA pins.
If you are adding any new Teleport Agents to the cluster during the CA rotation
you must configure them to trust both reported CA pins.
After the rotation is complete, only the new CA pin will be reported.

Note: Teleport Agents that connect to the Proxy Service never need a CA pin
because the Proxy's TLS certificate should issued by a trusted CA.

### `user`

The `user` CA issues a certificate when a user authenticates to Teleport. It
also signs client certificates for users connecting to Windows desktops and
Teleport SSH servers. Teleport-protected servers and Windows desktops use these
certificates.

Before you complete the rotation and reach the final `standby` phase,
users who have signed into Teleport must reauthenticate to receive a user
certificate from the new CA, otherwise web sessions and Teleport client commands
will fail and users may have to log out and log back in.
To avoid this, you can wait longer than the max user session TTL between the
`update_clients` and `standby` phases so that all user certificates signed by
the old CA will have already expired and required a re-login.

If you have registered Windows desktops with Teleport,
[follow the guide](../../../enroll-resources/desktop-access/active-directory.mdx)
to export the Teleport user CA so the Windows Desktop Service can authenticate
to RDP hosts.
Verify that you can connect to registered desktops throughout the rotation.

### `db` and `db_client`

The `db` and `db_client` CAs issue certificates that the Teleport Database
Service uses to communicate with self-hosted databases.

The Teleport Database Service presents a certificate signed by the `db_client`
CA when communicating with a self-hosted database, which an admin configures to
trust certificates issued by this CA.

Admins can configure self-hosted databases to present a certificate signed by
the `db` CA, which the Database Service uses to verify that a database server is
a genuine Teleport-protected resource. Alternatively, self-hosted databases can
present a certificate signed by a custom CA, and admins can configure the
Teleport Database Service to trust the CA.

#### Rotating the database CAs

These steps provide instructions to rotate both the `db` and `db_client` CAs
together, but it is also possible to rotate just one or the other and follow the
same steps.

Start by rotating both the `db` and `db_client` CAs to the `init` phase.
During the `init` phase, `tctl auth sign` will issue database server
certificates signed by the new `db` CA keys, and will output a CAs file
including both the old and new `db_client` CA certificates.
To avoid losing access to your self-hosted databases at any point, you should
reconfigure your databases during the `init` phase with new certificates and
trusted CAs.

<Admonition type="note">
`tctl auth sign --format db` is an exception to the usual behavior of the `init`
rotation phase.
When the `db` CA is in the `init` phase, `tctl auth sign --format db` will issue
database server certificates signed by the new CA keys.
This is so that self-hosted databases only need to be reconfigured twice during
a CA rotation: first during the `init` phase to get a certificate signed by the
new `db` CA and start trusting the new `db_client` CA, and second during the
final `standby` phase to stop trusting the old `db_client` CA.
</Admonition>

Consult the appropriate
[documentation](../../../enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx)
for configuring your databases before proceeding to the `update_clients`
rotation phase.

As soon as you proceed to the `update_clients` phase, the Teleport Database
Service will start using client certificates issued by the new `db_client` CA to
connect to databases.
Verify that you can still access your databases before and after transitioning
both CAs to the `update_clients` phase.

If all is well, proceed rotating both CAs to the `update_servers` and `standby`
phases.
After reaching the `standby` phase, you may once again reconfigure your
databases to stop trusting the old CA certificate that has now been rotated out.

#### Rolling back the rotation

The most common reason you would want to roll back is if you cannot reconfigure
your databases. If you have connectivity issues after reconfiguring a database,
it's likely that you misconfigured the database.

If you reconfigured any of your databases during the rotation, you will need
to reconfigure them again during the `rollback` phase before proceeding to the
`standby` phase.

### `openssh`

The `openssh` CA issues ephemeral SSH user certificates that the Proxy Service
uses to authenticate to
[OpenSSH servers registered with Teleport](../../../enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh.mdx).
The OpenSSH agent verifies these certificates when it receives incoming
connections from the Proxy Service.

During the `init` phase of `openssh` CA rotation all OpenSSH servers must be
updated to trust the new CA public key in addition to the existing public key.
This is necessary to avoid any loss of connectivity when the Proxy Service
starts using certificates signed by the new CA keys during the `update_clients`
phase.

If you used the
[manual method](../../../enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh-manual-install.mdx)
to enroll any OpenSSH servers, you must follow the instructions to export the
new `openssh` CA public key and provide it to your OpenSSH servers before you
transition the rotation to the `update_clients` phase.

If you used the
[automated method](../../../enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh-agentless.mdx)
you should reconfigure `sshd` by following the same steps before proceeding to
the `update_clients` phase.

<Admonition type="note">
OpenSSH servers use SSH host certificates issued by the `host` CA and trust
incoming certificates issued by the `openssh` CA.
Make sure you also reconfigure OpenSSH servers with a new host certificates when
rotating the `host` CA during the `update_servers` phase.
</Admonition>

### `jwt`

The Teleport Auth Service uses the `jwt` CA to sign JSON web tokens. The
Teleport Application Service includes JSON web tokens in HTTP messages that it
forwards to Teleport-protected applications, which use the `jwt` CA to verify
the tokens.

If you have enrolled web applications with Teleport, and those applications
authenticate traffic from the Teleport Application Service by verifying JSON web
tokens against the Teleport certificate authority, you need to ensure that these
applications continue to trust the rotated CA.

Teleport-protected JWT applications use one of two methods to retrieve the
public key of the Teleport `jwt` CA. Depending on the method, you may need to
take action after the `init` phase and before the rotation reaches the final
`standby` phase:

- **The application queries the `/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint of the
  Teleport Proxy Service.** In this case, no action is required as long as the
  application can continue to access the endpoint. If the application caches
  `jwks.json`, invalidate the cache.
- **The application accesses the `jwks.json` file on the local filesystem**.
  Obtain a new `jwks.json` file by querying the `/.well-known/jwks.json`
  endpoint and re-uploading the file.

For an example of exporting the `jwt` CA so a web application can trust
Teleport-issued JWTs, see the guide to [using JWT authentication with
Elasticsearch](../../../enroll-resources/application-access/jwt/elasticsearch.mdx).

### `saml_idp`

The `saml_idp` CA signs SAML messages sent by the Teleport IdP so services that
rely on the Teleport IdP can verify them.

If you are rotating this CA, then before entering the `update_clients` phase, you
must configure any service providers that rely on the Teleport SAML IdP to trust
the Teleport `saml_idp` CA. Follow the instructions in the
[SAML IdP documentation](../../access-controls/idps/saml-guide.mdx) to export an
XML metadata file and make it available to your service provider.

### `spiffe`

The `spiffe` CA signs X509 and JWT SVIDs for Workload Identity clients, often so
other clients can mutually verify their identity with mTLS.

When rotating this CA, before entering the final `standby` phase, ensure all
clients that validate Teleport-issued SVIDs have been updated to trust the new
CA:

- Teleport Workload Identity clients should receive the updated CA certificates
  automatically via the `tbot` client, and future SVIDs will be issued using the
  new CA.

  If using `tbot`'s `workload-identity-api` service, additional steps may be
  needed for client applications to fetch new SVIDs. If generating credentials
  with one of the `spiffe-svid` outputs, new SVIDs should be issued
  automatically.

- If using [SPIFFE federation](../../../enroll-resources/workload-identity/federation.mdx#federation-to-teleport-workload-identity),
  other SPIFFE trust domains should periodically refresh Teleport's certificate
  bundle. This interval is usually 5 minute, but you can examine the bundle
  yourself to verify:

  ```code
  $ curl https://example.teleport.sh/webapi/spiffe/bundle.json | jq '.spiffe_refresh_hint'
  ```

### `oidc_idp`

The `oidc_idp` CA signs messages sent by the Teleport OIDC IdP integration.
Relying parties (e.g., AWS) verify these messages to authenticate your Teleport
account for features like External Audit Storage, Auto-Discovery, and AWS Sync
for Access Graph.

The Teleport Proxy Service serves the JSON Web Key Sets for the OIDC IdP
integration from the `/.well-known/jwks-oidc` path of the Web API.

The `/.well-known/jwks-oidc` path of the Teleport Proxy Service Web API is
always enabled. The Teleport Proxy Service updates the endpoint automatically.

You can retrieve the full URL of the integration's JSON Web Key Sets by querying
the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` path of the Web UI and reading the
`jwks_uri` field:

```code
$ curl https://example.teleport.sh/.well-known/openid-configuration | jq '.jwks_uri'
"https://example.teleport.sh/.well-known-jwks-oidc"
```

## Step 2/4. Start a manual rotation

Once you have chosen a CA to rotate and have planned to check or update the
infrastructure that relies on that CA, you are ready to begin a manual rotation.

<Admonition type="tip">
In 17.0.5+ `tctl auth rotate` (with no arguments) starts an interactive
terminal UI for CA rotations.
The interactive UI displays a live cluster status, allows you to choose a CA to
rotate and guides you through each phase, automatically performs certain checks
to make sure the cluster is ready for the next phase, and lists manual steps
that need to be completed.
We recommend using the interactive rotation whenever possible, but you can read
on to learn how to manually initiate each rotation phase.
</Admonition>

### `init` phase

In the `init` phase, the Teleport Auth Service issues a new certificate
authority of the chosen type, but does not use it to sign certificates.

1. Initiate the manual rotation of host certificate authorities:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=init
   Updated rotation phase to "init". To check status use 'tctl status'
   ```

1. Use `tctl` to confirm that there is an active rotation in progress. This
   command prints the rotation status of all CAs that the Teleport Auth Service
   maintains in your cluster:

   ```code
   $ tctl status
   Cluster       teleport.example.com
   Version       (=teleport.version=)
   CA pins: sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

   okta      standby (never rotated)                 JWT      active  ECDSA P-256 software
   ```

1. Perform checks and updates on your infrastructure, depending on
   the CA type.

### `update_clients`

Execute the transition from `init` to `update_clients`. In this phase, The
Teleport Auth Service uses the new CA to sign certificates but continues to
trust certificates signed by the original CA.

1. Transition to the `update_clients` phase:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=update_clients
   # Updated rotation phase to "update_clients". To check status use 'tctl status'
   $ tctl status
   Cluster       teleport.example.com
   Version       (=teleport.version=)
   CA pins: sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
            sha256:1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

   ```

1. Check or update infrastructure that depends on your CA before proceeding to
   the next step.

1. If you lose connectivity to your resources, see if you need to reconfigure
   them to accept the new CA. If that does not restore access or you are unable
   to reconfigure a database, then [roll back](#step-44-optional-roll-back-the-rotation) to the original
   certificate authority.

### `update_servers`

Initiate the `update_servers` phase. In this phase, Teleport cluster components
(Agents, Auth Service, and Proxy Service instances) reload and start serving TLS
and SSH certificates signed by the new certificate authority, but still accept
certificates issued by the original certificate authority. This phase only
affects the `host` CA.

1. Execute the transition:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=update_servers
   # Updated rotation phase to "update_servers". To check status use 'tctl status'

   $ tctl status

1. Configure and check resources depending on the CA you are rotating. This is
   your final chance to update Teleport-protected resources before transitioning
   to the `standby` phase.

1. If you have lost connectivity to Teleport-protected resources, [roll
   back](#step-44-optional-roll-back-the-rotation) to the original certificate authority before entering the
   final `standby` phase, when rolling back is no longer possible.

### Final `standby`

Before wrapping up, verify that you have not lost access to Teleport-protected
resources that rely on the CA that you rotated.

1. Execute the transition:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --manual --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --phase=standby
   ```

1. Verify that the rotation has completed with `tctl`:

   ```code
   $ tctl status
   Cluster       teleport.example.com
   Version       (=teleport.version=)
   CA pins: sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

   spiffe    standby (never rotated)                         JWT      active RSA 2048    software
                                                             TLS      active ECDSA P-256 software
   okta      standby (never rotated)                         JWT      active ECDSA P-256 software
   ```

1. Follow the instructions for your CA to ensure that you can connect to
   Teleport-protected resources that rely on the CA that you rotated. This is
   the last stage where you have the opportunity to roll back. If you have lost
   connectivity to Teleport-protected resources, [roll back](#step-44-optional-roll-back-the-rotation) to the
   original certificate authority.

## Step 3/4. [Optional] Run a semi-automatic rotation

You can instruct Teleport to manage the CA rotation semi-automatically.
Semi-automatic rotation transitions between the phases of a rotation for you,
and there is no need to run a `tctl auth rotate` command for each phase. After a
**grace period** elapses, the Teleport Auth Service updates the phase of the CA
rotation to the next step.

### Determine whether to use a semi-automatic rotation

Aside from automatic phase updates, a semi-automatic rotation is identical to a
manual one. It is up to the operator to update any infrastructure to accommodate
the current phase before the grace period elapses.

Teleport does not check the status of any infrastructure that relies on the CA,
meaning that you can lose connectivity if things go wrong. As a result, you
**should not** carry out a semi-automatic rotation if you need to export a CA to
your infrastructure.

Complete a rotation in manual mode first to understand all the edge-cases and
hazards before attempting a semi-automatic rotation.

### Initiate a semi-automatic rotation

If you want to run a semi-automatic rotation, initiate it with `tctl` and
monitor the status of the rotation.

You can trigger semi-automatic rotation with the following command:

```code
$ tctl auth rotate --type=<Var name="type" />
```

The command triggers a rotation process for hosts with a default grace period of
48 hours.

<details>
<summary>Configuring the grace period</summary>

You can customize grace period and CA type with additional flags:

```code
# Rotate only user certificates with a grace period of 200 hours:
$ tctl auth rotate --type=user --grace-period=200h

# Rotate only host certificates with a grace period of 8 hours:
$ tctl auth rotate --type=host --grace-period=8h
```

Be careful when choosing a grace period when rotating the `host` CA.

The grace period needs to be long enough for all Agents and Proxy Service
instances in a cluster to request a new certificate. If some hosts go offline
during the rotation and come back only after the grace period has ended, they
will be forced to leave the cluster.

</details>

During semi-automatic rotations, Teleport attempts to divide the grace period so
that it spends an equal amount of time in each phase before transitioning to the
next phase. This means that using a shorter grace period will result in faster
state transitions.

## Step 4/4. [Optional] Roll back the rotation

You must perform a rollback before the rotation enters `standby` state.

1. Enter the rollback phase with a manual phase transition:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --phase=rollback --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --manual
   # Updated rotation phase to "rollback". To check status use 'tctl status'
   ```

1. Ensure that you can connect to Teleport resources that depend on the CA you
   were rotating.

1. Finish rolling back the CA rotation:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth rotate --phase=standby --type=<Var name="type" description="Certificate authority to rotate"/> --manual
   # Updated rotation phase to "standby". To check status use 'tctl status'
   ```
