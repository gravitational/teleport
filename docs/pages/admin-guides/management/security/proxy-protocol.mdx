title: Run Teleport with the PROXY Protocol
description: How to securely configure PROXY protocol usage with Teleport.
---

This guide shows you how to configure the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy
Service to run behind a layer 4 (l4) load balancer. 

In this setup, the Auth Service and Proxy Service rely on the PROXY protocol to
retrieve the IP addresses of clients when behind an L4 load balancer. Having
reliable client IP information is important from a security standpoint,
because features like audit logging and IP pinning depend on it. If the PROXY
protocol is not configured correctly, these features will be compromised.

<Admonition type="note">

Users of Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) do not need to manage PROXY protocol
setting. Teleport-managed Auth Service and Proxy Service deployments run behind
an L4 load balancer with the PROXY protocol configured.

## How it works

The PROXY protocol adds a prefix to a TCP connection containing information
about the client IP. It is most commonly used when a network includes an L4 load
balancer between the user and the endpoint service, like the Teleport Auth
Service and Proxy Service. 

L4 load balancers, by design, do not retain the original client's IP address and
port when forwarding the connection and the PROXY protocol allows systems to
overcome this problem by adding the client's original IP address and port before
the TCP stream.

Here is an example of the PROXYv1 protocol header:

```text
PROXY TCP4 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.2 12345 42\r\n
```

## Prerequisites

- A self-hosted Teleport Enterprise account. If you want to get started with
  self-hosted Teleport Enterprise, [contact
  Sales](https://goteleport.com/contact-us/). You can also [set up a demo
  environment](../../deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo.mdx) with Teleport Community Edition.

  We recommend reading and understanding this guide completely before
  configuring your Teleport cluster to use the PROXY protocol.

- The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool version >= (=teleport.version=).

  Visit [Installation](../../../installation.mdx) for instructions on downloading
  `tctl` and `tsh`.

## Step 1/2. Plan your Teleport deployment

Misconfiguration of the PROXY protocol behavior can lead to security problems.
Since the PROXY protocol lacks built-in authentication, a malicious attacker
could send falsified custom PROXY protocol headers to spoof their IP address. To
prevent this, you must explicitly configure PROXY protocol settings according to
your network setup:

1. Determine which Auth Service and Proxy Service instances should enable the
   PROXY protocol. PROXY protocol behavior is controlled separately for the Auth
   Service and Proxy Service. 

   If there's a PROXY-enabled L4 load balancer between your Proxy Service and
   Auth Service instances, you should enable the PROXY protocol on the Auth
   Service. Otherwise, you can disable it.

   Teleport Proxy Service instances can also have different PROXY protocol
   settings. If you run a subset of Proxy Service instances behind an L4 load
   balancer, you can enable the PROXY protocol for only those instances.

1. Make sure that any Auth Service or Proxy Service instances that you run with
   PROXY protocol support are only accessible through an L4 load balancer. This
   prevents attackers from spoofing their IP addresses and bypassing IP pinning
   restrictions by connecting directly and sending a custom PROXY header.
   Teleport only allows one PROXY protocol header for an incoming connection -
   it will reject requests that include multiple PROXY lines to prevent attacks.

1. If you don't run Teleport behind an L4 load balancer that sends PROXY
   headers, you **must** disable PROXY protocol support on the Auth Service and
   Proxy Service. Running Teleport behind an L4 load balancer that doesn't send
   PROXY protocol headers will lead to all incoming connections seemingly coming
   from the same IP address from Teleport's point of view, compromising the
   Teleport audit log and IP pinning feature.

## Step 2/2. Edit your static Teleport configuration

On a Teleport process, the Auth Service and Proxy Service can each support the
PROXY protocol for its own communications with clients. To enable or disable the
PROXY protocol, each service reads the `proxy_protocol` field in its section of
the Teleport configuration file:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  proxy_protocol: on | off
  # ...
auth_service:
  proxy_protocol: on | off
```

By default,  `proxy_protocol` is unspecified. Users can manually set
`proxy_protocol` to `on` or `off`:
- `on`: the PROXY protocol is enabled and mandatory. If a PROXY protocol header
  is received, the Teleport service will parse the header and extract the
  client's IP address and port. If the header isn't present, the Teleport
  service will reject the connection with an error.
- `off`: the PROXY protocol is disabled and forbidden. Any connection with a
  PROXY protocol header is automatically rejected.

We encourage users to explicitly set their `proxy_protocol` setting to `on` or
`off` mode depending on the network setup. 

If `proxy_protocol` is unspecified, the associated Teleport service does not
require the PROXY header for the connection, but will parse it if present, and
replace the client's source IP address with the one from the PROXY header. This
address will appear in audit events. Incoming connections with the PROXY header
will also be marked by setting source port to `0`, and this will be visible in
audit events as well.

IP pinning will not work if `proxy_protocol` setting wasn't explicitly set in
the config. Connections that are marked with `0` as the source port will be
rejected during IP pinning checks.

The default unspecified value mode is not suitable for production. It is only
suitable for test environments.
