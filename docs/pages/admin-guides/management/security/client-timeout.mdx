title: Securing Sessions with Client Timeout Enforcement
description: How to implement idle client timeouts.
---

The `client_idle_timeout` in Teleport is a configurable setting that helps improve security by terminating inactive sessions after a specified period. It can be applied globally or per role, 
allowing for flexibility based on your organization's security policies. The `client_idle_timeout` configuration ensures that SSH sessions, desktop sessions, kubectl exec or database 
connections that remain inactive for a certain period of time are automatically terminated. 

You can also use it to set limits for SSH sessions initiated *from* the web interface (note that this is distinct from `web_idle_timeout`, which sets idle timeout for the Web UI). 
This helps to mitigate risks associated with unattended sessions, such as unauthorized access.

## Use cases

- Security compliance: Many organizations require idle timeout enforcement as part of their security policies, ensuring that inactive sessions are not left open.
- Mitigating risk: If users forget to disconnect from a session, an idle timeout ensures that they are logged out automatically after a set period of inactivity, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## How it works
Teleport monitors user activity within sessions (like key presses or mouse movement).
If there is no detected activity for the duration defined by `client_idle_timeout`, the session is terminated, forcing the user to reconnect.
   
## Configuration
The `client_idle_timeout` can be configured globally or per role, giving administrators flexibility in how they apply client idle timeout rules.

- **Global configuration** (applies to all users):

You can set the `client_idle_timeout` globally in the Teleport cluster configuration (`teleport.yaml`) under the `auth_service` section:

```yaml
auth_service:
  client_idle_timeout: 15m
```
This example configures a global client idle timeout of **15 minutes**. After 15 minutes of client inactivity, the session will be terminated.

- **Per-role configuration** (applies to specific users or groups):

You can also specify the timeout on a per-role basis, allowing different users or groups to have different timeout settings. For example, you might want a shorter timeout for higher-privileged roles.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: admin-role
spec:
  options:
    client_idle_timeout: 10m
```

## Default behavior
If the `client_idle_timeout` is not set, sessions will not automatically close due to inactivity unless other timeout policies (like `disconnect_expired_cert`) are applied.
