title: Securing Sessions with Client Timeout Enforcement
description: How to implement idle client timeouts.
---

The `client_idle_timeout` in Teleport is a configurable setting that helps improve security by terminating inactive sessions after a specified period. It can be applied globally or per role, 
allowing for flexibility based on your organization's security policies. The `client_idle_timeout` configuration ensures that SSH sessions, desktop sessions, kubectl exec or database 
connections that remain inactive for a certain period of time are automatically terminated. This helps to mitigate risks associated with unattended sessions, such as unauthorized access.

## Use cases

- Security compliance: Many organizations require idle timeout enforcement as part of their security policies, ensuring that inactive sessions are not left open.
- Risk mitigation: If users forget to disconnect from a session, an idle timeout ensures that they are logged out automatically after a set period of inactivity, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## How it works
Teleport monitors user activity, such as key presses or mouse movement in desktop sessions, or network traffic from ssh or database connections.
If there is no detected activity for the duration defined by `client_idle_timeout`, the session is terminated, forcing the user to reconnect.
   
## Configuration
The `client_idle_timeout` can be configured globally or per role, giving administrators flexibility in how they apply client idle timeout rules.

### Global configuration (applies to all users)

You can set the `client_idle_timeout` globally in the Teleport cluster configuration (`teleport.yaml`) under the `auth_service` section:

```yaml
auth_service:
  client_idle_timeout: 15m
```
This example configures a global client idle timeout of **15 minutes**. After 15 minutes of client inactivity, the session will be terminated.


If you are a cloud customer, you will need to modify these settings using dynamic configuration.

Log in and use the `tctl` admin tool:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh
$ tctl status
```

Obtain your existing `cluster_auth_preference` resource:

```code
$ tctl get cap > cap.yaml
```

Include `client_idle_timeout` in `cap.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  options:
    client_idle_timeout: 30m # Set your desired timeout value
```

Create the `cluster_auth_preference` resource via `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
```

You should then see the following output:

```code
$ cluster auth preference has been created
```

### Per-role configuration (applies to specific users or groups)

You can also specify the timeout on a per-role basis, allowing different users or groups to have different timeout settings. For example, you might want a shorter timeout for higher-privileged roles.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: admin-role
spec:
  options:
    client_idle_timeout: 10m
```

## Default behavior
If the `client_idle_timeout` is not set, sessions will not automatically close due to inactivity unless other timeout policies (like `disconnect_expired_cert`) are applied.
