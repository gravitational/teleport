title: Running Teleport with Self-Signed Certificates
description: This guide shows you how to run Teleport using self-signed certificates, which is helpful for testing or demo environments.
---

This guide explains how to evaluate Teleport in a
non-production environment without having to configure TLS certificates.
We will show you how to run Teleport with self-signed certificates and address
problems caused by this configuration.

The Teleport Proxy Service authenticates itself to clients via TLS x509 certificates.
If certificates are not configured for the Proxy Service then it uses self-signed certificates,
which clients will not trust by default.
When visiting the cluster's Web UI, the certificate presented will not be trusted by your browser. In this case, 
you will likely see a page warning you that the website is not trusted.

Additionally, self-signed certificates can prevent `teleport`, `tsh`, and `tctl` from connecting
to the Proxy Service.

<Notice type="warning" title="DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION">
  **DO NOT USE SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES IN PRODUCTION**

  Configuring your cluster to trust self-signed certificates
  makes it easier for attackers to intercept communications
  between the Proxy Service and clients, since there is no
  way to verify the authenticity of the certificates.
  It is therefore important to properly configure certificates
  when using Teleport in a production environment.

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss"]} label="Open Source">

- A running Teleport cluster. For details on how to set this up, see our
  [Getting Started](../../deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo.mdx) guide (skip TLS certificate setup).

- A Teleport Proxy Service which does not have certificates or ACME automatic certificates configured.
For example, this Teleport Proxy Service configuration would use self-signed certs:

  ```yaml
  proxy_service:
    enabled: "yes"
    # TLS certificate for the HTTPS connection.
    https_keypairs: []
    # Get an automatic certificate from letsencrypt.org using ACME.
    acme: {}
  ```

## How to use self-signed certs with Teleport binaries and clients

### `teleport`

When running a Teleport service with `teleport`, if the service you are starting is configured to point to
the Teleport Proxy Service endpoint and the Proxy Service is using self-signed certificates, then `teleport` will need
to be run with the `--insecure` flag to disable verification of the
Proxy Service TLS certificate. This is the case when:
- The Teleport config file `proxy_server` setting is set to the Proxy Service endpoint:
  - `proxy_server: "tele.example.com:443"` or
  - `proxy_server: "tele.example.com:3080"`
- Teleport is started with the `--auth-server` flag pointing to the Proxy Service endpoint:
  - `teleport [app | db] start --auth-server=tele.example.com:443` or
  - `teleport [app | db] start --auth-server=tele.example.com:3080`

Instructions for disabling TLS certificate verification depend on how you are
running Teleport: via the `teleport` CLI, using a Helm chart, or via systemd:
<Tabs>

    <TabItem label="Using the CLI">
    When running `teleport` from the command line, pass the `--insecure` flag to disable
    TLS certificate validation. For example:
    ```sh
    $ sudo teleport start -c /etc/teleport.yaml --insecure
    $ sudo teleport app start -c /etc/teleport.yaml --insecure
    $ sudo teleport db start -c /etc/teleport.yaml --insecure
    ```
    Without the `--insecure` flag, you will see an error message that looks like
    `x509: “tele.example.com” certificate is not trusted`.
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="Helm chart">
    If you are using the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart, set
    [extraArgs](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster.mdx)
    to include the extra argument: `--insecure`:
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="values.yaml">
      ```yaml
      extraArgs:
      - "--insecure"
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="--set">
      ```code
      $ --set "extraArgs={--insecure}"
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    
    
    If you are using the `teleport-kube-agent` chart, set the 
    [insecureSkipProxyTLSVerify](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx)
    flag to `true`:
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="values.yaml">
      ```yaml
      insecureSkipProxyTLSVerify: true
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="--set">
      ```code
      $ --set insecureSkipProxyTLSVerify=true
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem label="systemd">
    Locate the `systemd` unit file for Teleport (called teleport.service) by running the following command:
    ```sh
    $ systemctl status teleport
    ```
    You will see output similar to the following, including the file path (`/lib/systemd/system/teleport.service`) that contains the unit file for the systemd configuration being applied:

    ```code
    ● teleport.service - Teleport Service
        Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/teleport.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
        Active: inactive (dead)
    ```

    Edit the Teleport unit file to include `--insecure` in the `ExecStart` line, for example:
    ```text
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/teleport start --pid-file=/run/teleport.pid --insecure
    ```
    
    After saving the unit file, you will need to reload the daemon for your changes to take effect:
    ```sh
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl restart teleport.service
    ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### `tctl`
When running `tctl` remotely via the Teleport Proxy Service, if the Proxy Service is using self-signed 
certificates, then `tctl` will not trust the certificate from the Proxy Service.
To disable certificate verification use the `--insecure` flag when running `tctl` commands.

`tctl` will determine how to connect to the Auth Service in a few ways:
- loading configuration from a local profile after logging in with `tsh`
- loading from a config file passed as an argument: `tctl -c /etc/teleport.yaml`
- passing the `--auth-server` flag directly, as in:
  - `tctl --auth-server=tele.example.com:443` or
  - `tctl --auth-server=tele.example.com:3080`

If any of these methods tries to connect via the Teleport Proxy Service, and the Proxy Service is using 
self-signed certificates, then `tctl` will not trust the certificate from the Proxy Service and you will get an
error message about
untrusted or invalid certificates, unless `--insecure` is also passed to `tctl`.

For example: `tctl status --insecure`

### `tsh`
When running `tsh`, you must specify the Teleport Proxy Service address for `tsh` to connect to.
If the Teleport Proxy Service is using self-signed certificates, then `tsh` will not trust the Proxy Service 
certificate.
In order to use `tsh` in this case, you need to use the `--insecure` flag.

For example: `tsh login --proxy=tele.example.com:443 --user=alice --insecure`

### Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect lets you [skip TLS certificate verification with the `--insecure`
flag](../../../connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx).
