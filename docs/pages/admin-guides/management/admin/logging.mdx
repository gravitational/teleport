## Configuration

In the configuration file of the Teleport instance, you can configure the logger's behavior by defining the output
destination, severity level, and output format.

Sample of `/etc/teleport.yaml` configuration for defining the logger settings.

```yaml
teleport:
  log:
    output: stderr
    severity: INFO
    format:
      output: text
      extra_fields: [caller, level]
```

If the output parameter is not defined or set as empty, `stderr` (aliases `err` or `2`) is used by default.
Other available options for defining the output include `stdout` (aliases `out` or `1`), `syslog` for writing
to the syslog file, or a filepath for direct writing to a log file destination.

Severity has several levels, which are sorted by decreasing priority (means that if `info` is selected, `warn` and `err` also applied):
 - `err`, `error` - used for errors that should definitely be noted.
 - `warn`, `warning` - non-critical entries that deserve attention.
 - `info` or empty value - general operational entries about what's going on inside the application.
 - `debug` - usually only enabled when debugging, verbose logging.
 - `trace` - designates more detailed informational events than the debug.

The default format for log output is `text`. Another available format is `json`, which may simplify log
parsing for systems like Logstash, Loki, or other log aggregators.

Format `extra_fields` defines additional fields which must be added to the log output:
 - `level` is the log field that stores the verbosity.
 - `component` is the log field that stores the calling component.
 - `caller` is the log field that stores the calling file and line number.
 - `timestamp` is the field that stores the timestamp the log was emitted.

On systemd-based distributions you can watch the log output by running the following command:

```code
$ teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
$ systemctl enable teleport
$ journalctl -fu teleport
```

To store logs as a file, the filepath should be set in the `log.output` configuration.

```yaml
teleport:
  log:
    output: /var/lib/teleport/log/output.log
```

When Teleport open or create a new log file, a filesystem watcher is launched in the background to monitor modifications.
If the file is renamed, moved, or deleted, a new one is created using the path defined in the configuration.
This is useful for implementing log rotation without needing to restart or interrupt the main service.

In this case, the log rotation configuration might look like the following sample `/etc/logrotate.d/teleport.conf`:

```
/var/lib/teleport/log/output.log {
    weekly
    compress
    notifempty
}
```
