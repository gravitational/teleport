title: Local Users
description: Learn how to manage local users in Teleport. Local users are stored on the Auth Service instead of a third-party identity provider.
---

In Teleport, **local users** are users managed directly via Teleport, rather
than a third-party identity provider. All local users are stored in Teleport's
cluster state backend, which contains the user's name, their roles and traits,
and a bcrypt password hash.

This guide shows you how to:

- [Add local users](./users.mdx#adding-local-users)
- [Edit existing users](./users.mdx#editing-users)
- [Delete users](./users.mdx#deleting-users)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Adding local users

A user identity in Teleport exists in the scope of a cluster.
A Teleport administrator creates Teleport user accounts and maps them to the roles they can use.

Let's look at this table:

| Teleport User | Allowed OS Logins | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `joe` | `joe`, `root` | Teleport user `joe` can log in to member Nodes as user `joe` or `root` on the OS. |
| `bob` | `bob` | Teleport user `bob` can log in to member Nodes only as OS user `bob`. |
| `kim` | | If no OS login is specified, it defaults to the same name as the Teleport user, `kim`. |

Let's add a new user to Teleport using the `tctl` tool:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss"]} label="Teleport Community Edition">
```code
$ tctl users add joe --logins=joe,root --roles=access,editor
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["enterprise", "cloud"]} label="Commercial">
```code
$ tctl users add joe --logins=joe,root --roles=access,editor,reviewer
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Teleport generates an auto-expiring token (with a TTL of one hour) and prints
the token URL, which must be used before the TTL expires.

```code
User "joe" has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to complete user setup, link is valid for 1h:
https://<proxy_host>:443/web/invite/<token>

NOTE: Make sure <proxy_host>:443 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

The user completes registration by visiting this URL in their web browser,
picking a password, and configuring multi-factor authentication. If the
credentials are correct, the Teleport Auth Service generates and signs a new
certificate, and the client stores this key and will use it for subsequent
logins.

The key will automatically expire after 12 hours by default, after which
the user will need to log back in with their credentials. This TTL can be
configured to a different value.

Once authenticated, the account will become visible via `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl users ls

# User           Allowed Logins
# ----           --------------
# admin          admin,root
# kim            kim
# joe            joe,root
```

## Editing users

Admins can edit user entries via `tctl`.

For example, to see the full list of user records, an administrator can execute:

```code
$ tctl get users
```

To edit the user `joe`, run the following command:

```code
$ tctl edit user/joe
```

Make your changes, then save and close the file in your editor to apply them.

## Deleting users

Admins can delete a local user via `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl users rm joe
```

In addition to users, you can use `tctl` to manage roles and other dynamic
resources. See our [Teleport Resources Reference](../../../reference/resources.mdx).

For all available `tctl` commands and flags, see our [CLI Reference](../../../reference/cli/tctl.mdx).

You can also configure Teleport so that users can log in using an SSO provider.
