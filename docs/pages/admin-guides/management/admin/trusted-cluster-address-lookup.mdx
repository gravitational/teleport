title: Commands to look up cluster addresses
description: Suggests command-line tools and scripts to look up cluster addresses.
---

If you aren't sure of what values to use for cluster settings such as the `tunnel_addr` 
or `web_proxy_addr` in resource configuration files, you can often look up the information 
using command-line tools that parse and extract machine-readable data from JSON files.
One of the most common of these tools is `jq`.
You can download `jq` for most operating systems from the 
[jqlang](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) website.

After you download the program, you can run commands that use the jq program to look up 
cluster addresses.

To get cluster addresses:

1. Set the `PROXY` environment variable to retrieve information about your Teleport cluster
by replacing `teleport.example.com` with your Teleport cluster domain:
   
   ```code
   $ PROXY=teleport.example.com
   ```

1. Extract the `tunnel_addr` for your cluster by running the following command:
   
   ```code
   $ curl https://$PROXY/webapi/ping | jq 'if .proxy.tls_routing_enabled == true then .proxy.ssh.public_addr else .proxy.ssh.ssh_tunnel_public_addr end'      
   ```

1. Extract the `web_proxy_addr` for your cluster by running the following command:
   
   ```code
   $ curl https://$PROXY/webapi/ping | jq .proxy.ssh.public_addr
   ```
