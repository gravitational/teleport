description: How to connect your AWS account with Teleport and provide access to AWS resources.

This guide explains how to set up the Teleport AWS OIDC integration.

With the AWS OIDC integration you will no longer need to deploy Teleport agents in AWS manually for most use cases.
The following features use an AWS OIDC integration to interact with AWS:
- [External Audit Storage](../external-audit-storage.mdx)
- RDS Auto Discovery
- EC2 Auto Discovery
- [Access Graph AWS Sync](../../teleport-policy/integrations/aws-sync.mdx)

It targets users who would prefer a more manual approach or to manage the integration with Infrastructure as Code tools.

As an alternative to this guide, you can use the Teleport Web UI (Access Management / Enroll New Integration).

## How it works
Teleport is added as an [OpenID Connect identity provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) to establish trust with your AWS account and assume a configured IAM role in order to access AWS resources.

For this to work, the `openid-configuration` and public keys are automatically exposed in your cluster at:
```code
$ curl https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />/.well-known/openid-configuration
```
The integration requires no extra configuration or services to run.

Initially, no policy is added to the IAM role, but users are asked to add them the first time they are trying to use a given feature.
For example, when setting up [External Audit Storage](../external-audit-storage.mdx), you will be asked to add the required policies to this IAM role.

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport cluster.
- AWS Account with permissions to create IAM Identity Providers and roles

## Step 1/4. Configure RBAC

To configure the integration you will need the following allow rules in one of your Teleport roles.
These are available by default in the preset `editor` role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      - integration
      verbs:
      - create
      - update
      - list
      - read
      - delete
      - use
```


## Step 2/4. Configure the Identity Provider in AWS
Navigate to [AWS IAM Identity Provider](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/identity_providers/create) and configure the Identity Provider:
- Provider type: OpenID Connect
- Provider URL:
```code
https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />
```
- Audience: `discover.teleport`

You should also add the following tags to help you track the resource in the future:
```code
teleport.dev/cluster      <Var name="cluster-name"/>
teleport.dev/origin       integration_awsoidc
teleport.dev/integration  <Var name="my-integration"/>
```

## Step 3/4. Create IAM role
An IAM role must be created to assign the required policies to the integration <Var name="iam-role"/>.

This IAM role is created without any policy, as those are added depending on the feature you would like to use, for example when setting up [Access Graph AWS Sync](../../teleport-policy/integrations/aws-sync.mdx).
However, it must be configured to allow the Identity Provider to assume it.
To achieve this, add the following Trust Relationship:
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<Var name="aws-account-id" description="AWS Account ID"/>:oidc-provider/<Var name="teleport.example.com" />"
			},
			"Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
			"Condition": {
				"StringEquals": {
					"<Var name="teleport.example.com" />:aud": "discover.teleport"
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```

It is also required to add the following tags, which are used by Teleport to ensure it can change the IAM role when onboarding new features:
```code
teleport.dev/cluster      <Var name="cluster-name"/>
teleport.dev/origin       integration_awsoidc
teleport.dev/integration  <Var name="my-integration"/>
```

## Step 4/4. Create integration resource
Create a file called `awsoidc-integration.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: integration
sub_kind: aws-oidc
version: v1
metadata:
  name: <Var name="my-integration"/>
spec:
  aws_oidc:
    role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::<Var name="aws-account-id"/>:role/<Var name="iam-role"/>"
```

Create the resource:
```code
$ tctl create -f awsoidc-integration.yaml
integration '<Var name="my-integration"/>' has been created
```

After the set up is complete, you can now use the "Enroll New Resource" flow in Teleport Web UI, or other integration dependent features.

## Next steps

Now that you have an integration, you can use the following features:
- [Access Graph AWS Sync](../../teleport-policy/integrations/aws-sync.mdx)
- [External Audit Storage](../external-audit-storage.mdx)
