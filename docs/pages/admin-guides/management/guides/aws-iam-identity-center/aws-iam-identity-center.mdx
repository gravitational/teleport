description: Provides an overview of the Teleport AWS IAM Identity Center integration.

Teleport's integration with [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/)
allows you to organize and manage your users' short- and long-term access to AWS
accounts and their permissions.

With the AWS Identity Center integration, you can manage AWS access by granting short term or long term access with Identity Governance.

## How it works

The Identity Center integration builds on top of Teleport's [role-based access controls](../../../access-controls/guides/guides.mdx),
[just-in-time Access Requests](../../../../identity-governance/access-requests/access-requests.mdx)
and [Access Lists](../../../../identity-governance/access-lists/access-lists.mdx) to manage
the creation and deletion of Identity Center _Account Assignments_. 

An _account assignment_ is the combination of a specific AWS Permission Set on a 
specific AWS account - for example "*AdminAccess on Production*" (where *Production* is 
an AWS account managed by Identity Center). All possible Account Assignments are
represented as resources within Teleport. When a user has access to an Account
Assignment in Teleport, that access is mirrored in AWS Identity Center.

When a Teleport user loses access to an Account Assignment in Teleport, that access
is similarly deleted in AWS. 

Access to Account Assignments can be granted via Teleport roles, either directly
to users or through Access Lists, or by Account Assignment resources included in
an approved Access Request.

When the integration is enabled, Teleport takes ownership over Identity Center 
users, groups, and permission set assignments:

- All Identity Center groups, along with their members, account and permission
  assignments, are imported into Teleport as Access Lists.
- Identity Center account and permission assignments are expressed as Teleport
  role policies.
- Changes made to Teleport users or Access Lists with Identity Center assigned
  permissions are reflected in the Identity Center.

For managing long-term access, Teleport cluster administrators can designate
Identity Center-synced Access Lists owners who will be responsible for adding
or removing users and performing periodic access reviews. Users added to or
removed from such Access Lists will be added to or removed from corresponding
Identity Center groups.

For short-term access, users can go through Teleport's standard Access Request
flow in which case Teleport will assign requested privileges to a particular
user and automatically unassign once the Access Request expires.
