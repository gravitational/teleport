description: How to set up and use Teleport AWS IAM Identity Center integration
---

Teleport's integration with [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/)
allows you to organize and manage your users' short- and long-term access to AWS
accounts and their permissions.

With the AWS Identity Center integration, you can manage AWS access by granting short term or long term access with Identity Governance.
