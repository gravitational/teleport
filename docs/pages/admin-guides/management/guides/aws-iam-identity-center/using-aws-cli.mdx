This guide will show you how to configure the `aws` command-line tool to use
access granted via Teleport and AWS Identity Center.

## How it works

For a deep dive into how Teleport manages AWS Identity Center access works you can
read the main [AWS IAM Identity Center guide](./aws-iam-identity-center.mdx). For the 
purposes of this guide, it's enough to understand that Teleport manages the creation
and deletion of AWS Account Assignments based on a users's Account Assignment grants,
either from their standing Teleport Roles, Access List membership or approved
Access Requests. 

You can access these Teleport-managed Accounts and Permission Set assignments
with the AWS CLI tools by using `sso` login and AWS profiles.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:

 * A Teleport-managed AWS Identity Center organization. See our [getting started guide](./guide.mdx)
   for setting up an Identity Center integration.
 * The AWS CLI tools, installed as per the AWS [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
 * The SSO Start URL and AWS Region for your Identity Center organization. Ask your AWS administrator for the appropriate values.

## Step 1/2. Configure the AWS SSO Session

This step configures the AWS CLI tools to use SSO for authentication. You can
either configure this manually, or via the `aws configure sso-session` wizard.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Wizard">
Invoke the AWS SSO configuration wizard by running the following command and
answering the questions asked by the wizard.  

```shell
$ aws configure sso-session
```

You will need to pick a name for the SSO session; this is just a local name for
this particular SSO configuration. For this example we are using `my-identity-center`. 

```shell
$ aws configure sso-session
SSO session name: my-identity-center
SSO start URL [None]: https://d-12234567890.awsapps.com/start
SSO region [None]: us-east-1
SSO registration scopes [sso:account:access]:
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manual Configuration">
You can configure SSO authentication manually by editing your `.aws/config` file. The above example would look like this:

```ini
[sso-session my-identity-center]
sso_start_url = https://d-12234567890.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing the SSO Session

To test the SSO configuration, try logging into AWS via SSO.

```shell
$ aws sso login --sso-session my-identity-center
```

This will launch a browser-based flow that will log you into AWS via Teleport
and ask you confirm the AWS CLI tool's access to AWS using your account.

## Step 2/2. Creating AWS Profiles

You will need to create a separate AWS CLI profile for each AWS Account and Permission Set
you want to access. These profiles will reference the SSO Session created above,
which tells the AWS tools to use SSO authentication when the profile is active.

Again you can do this either via an `aws configure` wizard, or editing your `/.aws/config` file directly.

<Admonition>
You can create as many profiles as you like, so repeat this step for as many AWS
Account / Permission Set pairs that you need.
</Admonition>

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Wizard">
To create a profile that uses given SSO session, invoke the SSO configuration 
wizard with the following commands, and answering the questions it asks:

```shell
$ aws configure sso
```

The wizard asks several questions about the profile to create, but for our
purposes, only selecting the AWS Account and Role are important. 

Firstly, select the AWS account this profile will use. The wizard will offer you
a list of available AWS accounts based on your current Account Assignments, if
you are only permitted to use a single AWS account, the wizard automatically
picks that and skips the question.

```shell
There are 2 AWS accounts available to you.
> Staging, my.login@example.com (058264527036)
  Production, my.login@example.com (637423191929)
```

Next, select the AWS Role to assume when this profile is active. Identity Center
Permission Sets are provisioned onto AWS accounts as Roles, so select the role
with the same name as the Permission Set you want to use.

```shell
There are 3 roles available to you.
  SecurityAudit
> AdministratorAccess
  PowerUserAccess
```

Again, if only one option is available the wizard will automatically select that
and skip the question.

After several generic AWS profile questions (e.g. default AWS region, default
output format, etc), the wizard will ask for the profile name. For this example,
given that the profile will use the `AdminAccess` role on the `Staging` account
we will call it `admin-on-staging`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Manual Configuration">
While helpful, the `aws configure sso` wizard requires currently-assigned Accounts
and Permission Sets to work with. You can pre-configure an AWS profile to use
Account Assignments that you currently do not have access to by editing your 
`~/.aws/config` file and adding the profile directly.

For example, the `admin-on-staging` profile we created above looks like this:

```ini
[profile admin-on-staging]
sso_session = my-identity-center
sso_account_id = 058264527036
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-east-1
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing the profile

You can test the profile by running `aws sts get-caller-identity` and verifying
the returned user ID and assumed Role. For example:

```shell
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --profile admin-on-staging
{
    "UserId": "AROA123456789AEXAMPLE:my.login@example.com",
    "Account": "058264527036",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::058264527036:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_69450ffeac834ef7/my.login@example.com"
}
```

Once you have validate that the profile is configured correctly, you can use the
`--profile` argument in any `aws` subcommand select it and use the corresponding
Identity Center Account assignment in that operation.

<Admonition type="info">
You can also use this profile with other tools that support the standard AWS client
environment variables. Set the profile by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment
variable. For example:


```shell
$ AWS_PROFILE=admin-on-staging ./some-aws-tool
```
</Admonition>

## Troubleshooting 

### "Invalid Callback" error

If AWS presents you with an "invalid Callback URL" error message, the most likely 
problem is an incorrect AWS region in your `sso-session` configuration. 

### "Error loading SSO Token" error

The AWS cache directory has probably been deleted. Log in again with `aws sso login --sso-session ${SSO_SESSION_NAME}`, 
where `${SSO_SESSION_NAME}` is the name of your configured SSO session.
