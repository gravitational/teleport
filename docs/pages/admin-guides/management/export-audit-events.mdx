The Teleport Auth Service emits audit logs when users and services interact with
your cluster.

You can use Teleport's Event Handler plugin to export audit events from Teleport
so you can store them in a log management platform or custom backend.

If you are new to exporting audit events with Teleport, read [Forwarding Events
with Fluentd](./export-audit-events/fluentd.mdx) to learn the basics of how our
Event Handler plugin works. While this guide focuses on Fluentd, the Event
Handler plugin can export audit events to any endpoint that ingests JSON
messages via HTTP.
