title: Profiling
description: Collecting pprof profiles.

Teleport leverages Go's diagnostic capabilities to collect and export
profiling data. Profiles can help identify the cause of spikes in CPU,
the source of memory leaks, or the reason for a deadlock.

## Enable profiling

The profiling endpoint is only enabled if the `--debug` flag is supplied.

(!docs/pages/includes/diagnostics/diag-addr-prereqs-tabs.mdx flags="--debug" !)

## Collecting profiles

Go's standard profiling endpoints are served at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/`.
Retrieving a profile requires sending a request to the endpoint corresponding
to the desired profile type. When debugging an issue it is helpful to collect
a series of profiles over a period of time.

### CPU
CPU profile shows execution statistics gathered over a user specified period:

``` code
# Download the profile into a file:
$ curl -o cpu.profile http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30

# Visualize the profile
$ go tool pprof -http : cpu.profile
```

### Goroutine

Goroutine profiles show the stack traces for all running goroutines in the system:

``` code
# Download the profile into a file:
$ curl -o goroutine.profile http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/goroutine

# Visualize the profile
$ go tool pprof -http : goroutine.profile
```

### Heap

Heap profiles show allocated objects in the system:

```code
# Download the profile into a file:
$ curl -o heap.profile http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/heap

# Visualize the profile
$ go tool pprof  -http : heap.profile
```

### Trace

Trace profiles capture scheduling, system calls, garbage collections, heap size, and other events that are collected by the Go runtime
over a user specified period of time:

```code
# Download the profile into a file:
$ curl -o trace.out http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5

# Visualize the profile
$ go tool trace trace.out
```
