title: Logger Configuration
description: Explains how to configure the logger on a Teleport instance.
---

In the configuration file of a Teleport instance, you can configure the logger's behavior by defining the output
destination, severity level, and output format.

```yaml
teleport:
  log:
    output: stderr
    severity: INFO
    format:
      output: text
      extra_fields: [caller, level]
```

If the output parameter is not defined or set as empty, `stderr` (aliases `err` or `2`) is used by default.
Other available options for defining the output include `stdout` (aliases `out` or `1`), `syslog` for writing
to the syslog file, or a filepath for direct writing to a log file destination.

Severity has several levels, which are sorted by decreasing priority:
 - `err`, `error` - used for errors that require action from the user.
 - `warn`, `warning` - non-critical entries that deserve attention.
 - `info` or empty value - general operational entries about what's going on inside the application.
 - `debug` - usually only enabled when debugging, verbose logging.
 - `trace` - designates more detailed information about actions and events.

When we choose `info` severity level, `warning` and `error` are also applied by priority rule.

The default format for log output is `text`. Another available format is `json`, which may simplify log
parsing for systems like Logstash, Loki, or other log aggregators.

Format `extra_fields` defines additional fields which must be added to the log output:
 - `level` is the log field that stores the verbosity.
 - `component` is the log field that stores the calling component.
 - `caller` is the log field that stores the calling file and line number.
 - `timestamp` is the field that stores the timestamp the log was emitted.

On systemd-based distributions you can watch the log output by running the following command:

```code
$ teleport install systemd -o /etc/systemd/system/teleport.service
$ systemctl enable teleport
$ journalctl -fu teleport
```

## Log rotation support

To store logs as a file, the filepath should be set in the `log.output` configuration.

```yaml
teleport:
  log:
    output: /var/lib/teleport/log/output.log
```

When Teleport opens or creates a new log file, a filesystem watcher is launched in the background to monitor the file modifications.
If the log file is renamed, moved, or deleted, Teleport automatically creates a new one.
This is useful for implementing log rotation without needing to restart or interrupt the main service.

Using `logrotate` as an example, you may define the following config `/etc/logrotate.d/teleport.conf`
to rotate Teleport log file weekly:

```code
/var/lib/teleport/log/output.log {
    weekly
    compress
    notifempty
}
```
