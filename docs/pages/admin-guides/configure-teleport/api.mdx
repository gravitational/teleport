The Teleport Auth Service provides a gRPC API for remotely interacting with your
cluster. In this section, we will show you how to use Teleport's API. 

Teleport has a public [Go
client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client) to
programatically interact with the API. [tsh and tctl](../../reference/cli.mdx)
use the same API.

Here is what you can do with the Go Client:

 - Integrate with external tools, e.g., to write an [Access Request
   plugin](../access-controls/just-in-time/access-request-plugins.mdx). Teleport
   maintains Access Request plugins for tools like Slack, Jira, and Mattermost.
 - Perform CRUD actions on resources, such as roles, authentication connectors,
   and provisioning tokens.
 - Dynamically configure Teleport.

The following guides provide tours of API libraries that are relevant when
setting up an API client to automate some aspect of setting up Teleport. Read
these guides to set up a minimal working example and plan your own use of
Teleport's API client libraries:
