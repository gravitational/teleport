Teleport Policy unifies management of access policies across your infrastructure.
It hardens your access controls and visually shows up-to-date relationships and policies of all users, groups, and computing resources
It can help you answer questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

## Getting started with Teleport Policy

Teleport Policy is a separately licensed product and is available to Teleport Enterprise customers.
Access Graph is a major capability of Teleport Policy that visually shows the relationships of
policies of users, groups, and computing resources.

To verify the availability of the Access Graph, ensure that the Policy icon is present in the navigation sidebar.

Note: For managed Enterprise customers, Teleport Policy is enabled by default.
If you are a self-hosted Teleport customer, you will need to [deploy the Access Graph Service](../deploy-a-cluster/access-graph/access-graph.mdx) and ensure you have an updated
`license.pem` with Teleport Policy enabled to use it.
