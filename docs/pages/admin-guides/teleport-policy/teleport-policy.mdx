Teleport Policy unifies management of access policies across your infrastructure. 
It hardens your access controls and visually shows up-to-date relationships and policies of all users, groups, and computing resources
It can help you answer questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

## Getting started with Teleport Policy

Teleport Policy is a separately licensed product and is available to Teleport Enterprise customers.
Access Graph is a major capability of Teleport Policy that visually shows the relationships of 
policies of users, groups, and computing resources.

After logging into the Teleport UI, go to the Management tab. If enabled, Teleport Policyâ€™s Access Graph options 
can be found under the Permission Management section.

<Admonition type="note">
Note: For managed Enterprise customers, Teleport Policy is enabled by default.
If you are a self-hosted Teleport customer, you will need to [deploy the Access Graph Service](../deploy-a-cluster/access-graph/access-graph.mdx) and ensure you have an updated 
`license.pem` with Teleport Policy enabled to use it.
