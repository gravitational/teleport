title: Teleport Identity Security
description: A reference for Access Graph with Identity Security.
---

Teleport Identity Security unifies management of access policies across your infrastructure.
It hardens your access controls and visually shows up-to-date relationships and policies of all
users, groups, and computing resources.

It can help you answer questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

## Getting started with Identity Security

Identity Security is a separately licensed product and is available to Teleport Enterprise customers.
Access Graph is a major capability of Identity Security that visually shows the relationships of
policies of users, groups, and computing resources.

To verify the availability of the Access Graph, ensure that the Policy icon is present in the navigation sidebar.

<Admonition type="note">
Note: For managed Enterprise customers, Identity Security is enabled by default.
If you are a self-hosted Teleport customer, you will need to [deploy the Access Graph Service](../deploy-a-cluster/access-graph/access-graph.mdx) and ensure you have an updated
`license.pem` with Identity Security enabled to use it.
