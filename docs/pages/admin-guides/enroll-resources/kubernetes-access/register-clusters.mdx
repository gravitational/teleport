In some cases, you will want to register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport
manually, rather than letting Teleport [discover the cluster
automatically](../auto-discovery/kubernetes.mdx). There are a few ways to do
this:

{/*TOPICS*/}

- [Dynamic Kubernetes Cluster Registration](register-clusters/dynamic-registration.mdx): Register and unregister Kubernetes clusters without restarting a Teleport Kubernetes Service instance.
- [Register a Kubernetes Cluster using IAM Joining](register-clusters/iam-joining.mdx): Connecting a Kubernetes cluster to Teleport with IAM joining.
- [Register a Kubernetes Cluster with a Static kubeconfig](register-clusters/static-kubeconfig.mdx): Connecting standalone Teleport installations to Kubernetes clusters.
