title: Troubleshooting Application Access
description: Describes common issues and solutions for access to applications protected by Teleport.
---

This section describes common issues that you might encounter in managing access to applications
with Teleport and how to work around or resolve them.

## Unable to access applications

The most common issues that prevent access to applications involve Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors.

Cross-Site Request Forgery is a type of attack that uses an authenticated user's identity to perform operations
without the user's knowledge. For example, a CSRF attack might transfer funds, change passwords, or make purchases
by issuing a forged request with the user's credentials. Browsers and applications have checks to prevent these
types of attacks. However, the checks can also block legitimate requests under certain conditions.

### Symptom

If your browser can't create a secure cookie or can't authorize your login from a previously-created secure
cookie, you might see the following error:

**Invalid or missing CSRF token**

This error can be caused by ad-blocking or script-blocking extensions or by the browser itself.
For access to applications through Teleport, you might see this error with most often with
applications—like Grafana and ArgoCD—that use WebSockets extensively and in browsers where
cross-site scripting restrictions require traffic to be explicitly allowed.

Issues with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usually
result in a loss of application functionality, errors in the application itself indicating that
traffic isn't being permitted, or application logs that indicate CORS or CSRF errors.

### Solution

In most cases, you can fix these types of issues by adding explicit `rewrite` settings for the Origin and Host headers
in the Teleport configuration file for each application.

To fix CSRF or CORS issues:

1. Open the `/etc/teleport.yaml` file that contains the application configuration in a text editor.

1. Add a `rewrite.headers` section similar to the following `grafana` example:

   ```yaml
   app_service:
     enabled: true
     apps:
     - name: grafana
       uri: http://localhost:3000
       public_addr: grafana.teleport.example.com
       rewrite:
         headers:
         - "Origin: https://grafana.teleport.example.com" # Teleport application subdomain prepended with "https://"
         - "Host: grafana.teleport.example.com" # Teleport application subdomain itself
   ```

1. Save your changes and restart the Teleport service.

To fix CSRF or CORS issues if you deploy applications using Kubernetes and `teleport-kube-agent`:

1. Open the `teleport/examples/chart/teleport-kube-agent/values.yaml` file that contains the application
   configuration in a text editor.

1. Locate the `apps` section in the `values.yaml` file.

   ```yaml
   # Details of at least one app to be proxied. Example:
   # apps:
   #  - name: grafana
   #    uri: http://localhost:3000
   apps: []
   ```

1. Add a `rewrite.headers` section similar to the following `grafana` example:

   ```yaml
   app_service:
     enabled: true
     apps:
     - name: grafana
       uri: http://localhost:3000
       public_addr: grafana.teleport.example.com
       rewrite:
         headers:
         - "Origin: https://grafana.teleport.example.com" # Teleport application subdomain prepended with "https://"
         - "Host: grafana.teleport.example.com" # Teleport application subdomain itself
   ```

## Untrusted certificate errors

By default, the certificates presented by the Teleport Proxy Service must be trusted and issued by
a recognized certificate authority.

### Symptom

If you have created self-signed certificates or use certificates signed by an unrecognized
certificate authority, you might see an error similar to the following:

```text
ERROR: "unable to verify HTTPS certificate chain in : \x1b[31mERROR: \x1b[0mWARNING:"

  The proxy you are connecting to has presented a certificate signed by a
  unknown authority. This is most likely due to either being presented
  with a self-signed certificate or the certificate was truly signed by an
  authority not known to the client.
```

### Solution

If you have properly created a root certificate authority and a self-signed
certificate, you can use the `--insecure` command-line option to allow clients
to accept the certificate. For example, you can start Teleport with a self-signed
certificate by running a command similar to the following:

```code
sudo teleport start --config=/etc/teleport.yaml --insecure
```

If you have your own certificate authority that you would like to use to
validate the certificate chain presented by the Teleport Proxy Service, you can
manually set the `SSL_CERT_FILE` or `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variable on the
command line. For example:

```code
sudo SSL_CERT_FILE=<Var name="path-to-rootCA-pem" /> teleport start --config=/etc/teleport.yaml
```

You should specify the `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variables as command-line
options because `sudo` doesn't inherit environment variables by default.

## Request headers too large

By default, Teleport embeds the user's Teleport roles and traits in the JWT that
is issued for applications. If your Teleport user has a large number of roles or
traits, this can cause the JWT to become too large which will result in a failed
request.

### Symptom

When attempting to connect to an HTTP app behind Teleport, you see an error
that states *request header fields too large*.

### Solution

If the application that you're protecting with Teleport does not need to know
about a user's Teleport roles or traits, you can configure Teleport to omit
this information from the JWT. This will result in a smaller JWT that is less
likely to exceed the limit.

This configuration is available under the `jwt_claims` property of the
application's `rewrite` configuration. See
[Web Application Access](./guides/connecting-apps.mdx#configuring-the-jwt-token)
for details.
