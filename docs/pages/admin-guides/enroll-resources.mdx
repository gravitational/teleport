title: Enroll Infrastructure Resources
description: Guides for enrolling servers, databases, and other infrastructure resources with Teleport so you can set up secure access.
---

You can use Teleport to set up secure access to resources in your infrastructure
such as Linux servers, databases, and Windows desktops. 

The guides in this section show you how to enroll infrastructure resources in
your Teleport cluster.

Teleport **Agents** are Teleport processes that proxy traffic to and from
infrastructure resources.  Agents check the permissions of a user who attempts
to access proxied resources, and only permit a connection to a resource if the
resource's **labels** match the labels allowed by the user's role.
