title: Teleport Authentication with Google Workspace (G Suite)
description: How to configure Teleport access with Google Workspace (formerly known as G Suite)
videoBanner: WTLWc6nnPfk
---

This guide explains how to configure [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)
to be a single sign-on (SSO) provider that issues Teleport credentials to specific
groups of users. When you use Google Workspace in combination with Teleport role-based 
access control (RBAC), you can define policies like the following:

- Only members of the "DBA" Google group can connect to PostgreSQL databases.
- Developers must never use SSH to access production servers.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, verify the following:

- You have a Google Workspace super administrator account. 
  As a best practice, you should set up a separate account that requires multifactor 
  authentication to perform administrative actions. In most cases, you should avoid 
  granting your own sign-in user account elevated administrative privileges.

- You can sign up for Google Cloud and create a Google Cloud project. 
  Note that this guide doesn't require using any paid Google Cloud services.

- You can set up Google Workspace groups.

- You have a Teleport role with permission to maintain `oidc` resources. 
  This permission is available in the preset `editor` role.

- You have a Teleport cluster, Enterprise edition, and command-line tools.

## Step 1/4. Configure Google Workspace

The following steps are required to configure Google Workspace to work with Teleport:

- Review your Google Workspace edition to determine how it integrates with Teleport.
- Create a new project on the Google Cloud Platform.
- Configure OAuth consent for the new project.
- Enable the required APIs.
- Create an OAuth client ID to allow Google Workspace users to log in to your Teleport cluster.
- Create a service account for Teleport to access additional Google Groups information.
- Configure domain-wide delegation for the service account.

### Review your Google Workspace edition

Google Workspace is available in multiple editions with different features and capabilities
for individuals and organizations. Because of differences between Google Workspace editions,
there are fundamental differences in how Teleport integrates with Google Workspace depending on
the Google Workspace edition you use. 

Some editions of Google Workspace provide **transitive group membership**.
With transitive group membership, a user can be a member of one group by virtue of being in 
another group. For example, if there is a child group nested within a parent group, every 
member of the child group is also a member of the parent group. Teleport can support both 
direct group membership and transitive group membership, but does so using different methods.

#### Google Workspace editions and API

Google Workspace service accounts can determine whether a user has a transitive
membership in a specific group by calling methods in the Google Workspace
**Cloud Identity API**. These API methods are only usable for users belonging to
specific Google Workspace editions.

The Google Workspace **Directory API** allows administrators to list users and
groups in their Google Workspace domain, but does not enable them to query
transitive group memberships. The Directory API is available for all Google
Workspace editions.

#### How Teleport uses Google Workspace APIs

The Teleport OIDC connector uses the Google Workspace APIs to map Google Workspace 
group members to the Teleport roles they belong to.

To list a user's Google Workspace groups, Teleport first attempts to
get credentials by calling Cloud Identity API methods. If successful, Teleport uses 
the credentials to query a user's transitive group memberships.

If the credentials don't exist, Teleport gets credentials by calling 
Directory API methods. Teleport then uses the Directory API to list the 
user's groups in the entire Google Workspace for your organization. 
Groups that the user belongs to that are external to the workspace aren't listed.

#### How to check your current edition

To determine whether your Google Workspace edition supports querying transitive
group memberships:

1. Open [Inspect Groups](https://admin.google.com/ac/groupsinspection)
in the Google Workspace Admin Console. 

   Group inspection relies on the Cloud Identity API. 
   
1. Select **List all groups for a member** and **Include external groups**.
   
   If your Google Workspace edition supports the Cloud Identity API, you should
   block access to external groups at the workspace level as described in [Allow or block
   access to external groups](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9468710). Otherwise, 
   membership in any group external to the workspace will prevent users from signing in.
   
   If your Google Workspace edition doesn't support the Cloud Identity API, you must
   ensure that your role-based access controls don't depend on transitive group memberships.

### Create a new project

If you want to add single sign-on for Teleport to an existing Google Cloud project, you can 
select that project in the Google Cloud console and skip this step. If you don't have a project 
or want to create a new project specifically for Teleport, you can go directly to the 
Enabled APIs & Service [project selector dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/dashboard) 
to create one.

To create a new project:

1. Open the Google Cloud console.

1. In the Google Cloud console navigation menu, click **APIs & Services**.

1. In **Enabled APIs and services**, click the project selector, then click **New Project**.
   If there are no projects to select in the dashboard, click **Create Project**.
   
   ![Create or select a project](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/google-new-project.png)

1. Type a Project name and select an organization and a location for the project, then 
click **Create**.

### Configure OAuth consent

To configure OAuth consent for the new project:

1. In the Google Cloud console sidebar, click **OAuth consent screen**.

1. Select **Internal** as the User Type, then click **Create**.
   
   ![Select Internals](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/google-oauth-consent.png)

1. Configure the OAuth client consent information by doing the following:
   
   - Type an application name.
   - Select a user or group to receive email messages from users about their OAuth consent.
   - Set other application options, as needed.
   - Provide the email address of the developer to contact if there are changes to the project.

1. Click **Save and continue**.

1. Click **Add or remove scopes**.

1. Select **.../auth/userinfo.email** and **openid** scopes, then click **Update**.

1. Click **Save and continue**.

1. Review the information on the Summary page, then click **Back to dashboard**.

### Enable the required APIs

To enable required APIs for the OAuth client:

1. Select [Admin SDK API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/admin.googleapis.com)
in the API Library, then click **Enable** to support direct group membership.
1. Select [Cloud Identity API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudidentity.googleapis.com) 
in the API Library, then click **Enable** to support transitive group membership.

You can enable one or both API libraries.
However, your Google Workspace edition must support the API you choose to use.
Consult the documentation for the API library to ensure that you have a
supported Google Workspace edition.

### Create an OAuth client ID

To create an OAuth client identifier:

1. In the Google Cloud console sidebar, click **APIs & Services**.

1. In the APIs & Services sidebar, click **Credentials**.

1. Click **Create credentials** to display a list of the credentials you can create.
   
   ![Create credentials](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/google-create-credentials.png)

1. Select **OAuth client ID**.

1. Select **Web application** as the Application type, and type a name for the application.

1. Under Authorized redirect URIs, click **Add URI**.

1. Set the redirect URI to the address of your Teleport cluster, then add 
`/v1/webapi/oidc/callback` to the URI.
   
   ![OAuth client ID creation](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/redirect-uri.png)

1. Click **Create**.

1. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** from the OAuth client created or click **Download JSON**
to save this information, then click **OK**.
   
   If you choose to save the client identifier and client secret by clicking **Download JSON**, 
   be aware that this JSON file isn't the one used to handle the credentials for authentication.
   A second JSON file is generated when you create the service account for the OAuth client.

   For example:

   ![OAuth client data](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/oauth-client-id-and-secret.png)

### Create a service account

To create a service account:

1. In the Google Cloud console sidebar, click **IAM & admin**, then select **Service Accounts**. 

1. Click **Create service account**.

1. Type a name for your service account and, optionally, a description of what the service account is for.
   
1. Click **Create and continue**, then click **Done**.

   ![Create the service account](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/google-service-account.png)

   After you click **Done**, the new service account is added to the list of service accounts for the current
   project. You can click the newly-created account to view its details and to edit information for the
   account.

1. Click the new service account to displays its Details, and copy its **Unique ID** for later.
   
   ![Copy the Unique ID for the service account](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/service-account-unique-id.png)

1. Click **Keys**, click **Add key**, and select **Create new key** to create keys for the service account.

   ![service account key creation](../../../img/sso/googleoidc/service-account-keys.png)

1. Select **JSON** as the Key type, then click **Create**.
   
   Google Cloud automatically downloads a JSON file with the keys for the service account 
   similar to the following:

   ```yaml
   {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": "teleport-project-xxxxxx",
      "private_key_id": "f06e000000000000000dc18",
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n0000000000000w==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": "g-w-sso@teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "client_id": "11xxxxxxxxxxxxx76",
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gwsso%40teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
    }
    ```

   This file is used to configure the OIDC connector for the Teleport Auth Service to use, 
   either by referencing a local file on the host running the Teleport Auth Service or including the contents 
   in the command line to create the connector resource.
   
### Configure domain-wide delegation

Now that you have a service account for Teleport to use, you can configure 
[domain-wide delegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation) for the
service account.

To configure delegation:

1. Open the Google Workspace Admin console and navigate to 
[Manage domain-wide delegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation).

1. Click **Add new**.

1. Paste the numeric Unique ID that you copied from the service account.

1. Add **one** of the following scopes depending on your Google Workspace edition:
   
   - For direct groups only, add:
      `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`
   - For direct and transitive group membership support, add:
      `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups.readonly`

1. Click **Authorize**.

## Step 2/4. Create an OIDC connector

After you have prepared Google Workspace, you can create the OIDC connector by 
running the `tctl sso configure oidc` command. Depending on how you have deployed
your Teleport cluster, you can create the OIDC connector resource in one of two ways:

- You can **embed** the service account information in the connector resource.
- You can **upload** the service account JSON file to hosts running the Teleport Auth Service.

The service account JSON must be available to **all Teleport Auth Service hosts** if you 
deploy Teleport as a high availability cluster. In most cases, you should use the 
**embedded JSON** method to create the connector in high availability and cloud deployments to avoid 
storing credentials in a file on multiple servers.

The alternative to creating the OIDC connector with embedded JSON is to upload the JSON file.
If you have a self-hosted Teleport cluster, you can upload the service account JSON file to all hosts 
running the Teleport Auth Service.

On your workstation, create a file called `client-secret.txt` consisting only of
your client secret.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Embed JSON">

The following command defines the service account by embedding JSON in the command used to create the connector resource.
With this method, you don't have to provide the JSON file to all of the hosts running the Teleport Auth Service.

```code
$ tctl sso configure oidc --preset google --id <CLIENT-ID> \
--secret $( cat client-secret.txt) \
--claims-to-roles groups,auditor@example.com,auditor \
--claims-to-roles groups,teleport-developers@example.com,access \
--google-admin=<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL> \
--google-acc '
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": <GOOGLE-PROJECT-ID>,
  "private_key_id": <GOOGLE-PRIVATE-KEY-ID>,
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n0000000000000w==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": <GOOGLE-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL>,
  "client_id": <GOOGLE-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-UNIQUE-ID>,
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gwsso%40teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}'
```

After copying this command, be sure to remove the brackets (< >) and replace the placeholder strings with the 
appropriate information for your Google Workspace. For example, replace `<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>` with 
the email address for the domain administrator similar to `admin@yourdomain.com`.

This command creates a file similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: google
spec:
  claims_to_roles:
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - auditor
    value: auditor@example.com
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - access
    value: teleport-developers@example.com
  client_id: <CLIENT-ID>
  client_secret: <CLIENT-SECRET>
  display: Google
  google_admin_email: <GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>
  google_service_account: |2-

    {
      "type": "service_account",
      "project_id": <GOOGLE-CLOUD-PROJECT-ID>,
      "private_key_id": <GOOGLE-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-PRIVATE-KEY-ID>,
      "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n0000000000000w==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_email": <GOOGLE-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-EMAIL>,
      "client_id": <GOOGLE-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-UNIQUE-ID>,
      "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
      "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
      "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
      "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gwsso%40teleport-project-xxxxxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
    }
  issuer_url: https://accounts.google.com
  redirect_url: https://example.teleport.sh:443/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
version: v3
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Upload JSON">

The following command specifies the path to the JSON file on a host running the Teleport Auth Service.
You can use this method for self-hosted Teleport Auth Service instances if you can
make the JSON file available to all hosts running the Teleport Auth Service.

```code
$ tctl sso configure oidc --preset google --id <CLIENT-ID> \
--secret $( cat client-secret.txt) \
--google-acc-uri <PATH/TO/SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY>.json \
--claims-to-roles groups,auditor@example.com,auditor \
--claims-to-roles groups,teleport-developers@example.com,access \
--google-admin=<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL> > gworkspace-connector.yaml
```

After copying this command, be sure to remove the brackets (< >) and replace the placeholder strings with the 
appropriate information for your Google Workspace. For example, replace `<GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>` with 
the email address for the domain administrator similar to `admin@yourdomain.com`.

This command creates a file similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: google
spec:
  claims_to_roles:
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - auditor
    value: auditor@example.com
  - claim: groups
    roles:
    - access
    value: teleport-developers@example.com
  client_id: <CLIENT-ID>
  client_secret: <CLIENT-SECRET>
  display: Google
  google_admin_email: <GOOGLE-WORKSPACE-ADMIN-EMAIL>
  google_service_account_uri: </PATH-TO-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY>.json
  issuer_url: https://accounts.google.com
  redirect_url: https://teleport.example.com/v1/webapi/oidc/callback
version: v3
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The email that you set for `google_admin_email` **must** be the email address of
an account that has permission to list all groups, users, and group membership in
Google Workspace. In general, this user account must have full administrative privileges 
or group administrative privileges.

Don't use the email of the service account for `google_admin_email`. The
configuration might look the same, but the service account doesn't have
the required domain-wide delegation.

The `client_id` field must be the unique numeric ID for the service account that you created 
for the OAuth client in the Google Cloud console. You can check whether this setting is configured 
correctly by viewing the audit logs on the host running the Teleport Auth Service or from 
the **Management** tab in the Teleport Web UI. If you see "invalid Google Workspace 
credentials for scopes [...]" in audit log messages, change the `client_id` setting in the 
resource configuration file. For more information about viewing audit logs, see 
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

To test the connector, run the following command:

```code
$ cat gworkspace-connector.yaml | tctl sso test
```

This command opens the browser and attempts to sign you in to your Teleport cluster
using Google. If it fails, review the command output for troubleshooting
information.

To create the connector using the `tctl` tool, run the following command:

```code
$ tctl create -f gworkspace-connector.yaml
```

## Step 3/4. Test your Google Workspace OIDC connector

After you create the connector, the Teleport Web UI displays a new sign-in option, **Login with Google**. 
To sign in from the command-line:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login --auth=google
```

This command displays the single sign-on endpoint URL and tries to open it
automatically in a browser.
