title: Migrate Between Teleport Plans
description: Explains how to migrate between Teleport Enterprise (Self-Hosted), Teleport Enterprise (Cloud), and Teleport Community Edition.
---

This guide explains how to migrate from Teleport Community Edition, Teleport
Enterprise (Self-Hosted) and Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) to another Teleport
plan. 

We recommend that you try out a Teleport [demo
cluster](deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo.mdx) with Teleport Community Edition,
migrate to [Teleport Enterprise (Cloud)](../get-started.mdx) to roll out
Teleport across your organization, and deploy a
[self-hosted](deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx) Teleport Enterprise cluster
if you have security and compliance requirements that Teleport Enterprise
(Cloud) cannot address.  

## How it works

While in a cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise plan, Teleport manages the Auth
Service and Proxy Service for you, but you need to migrate dynamic resources and
Teleport services yourself. In a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise plan, as well
as Teleport Community edition, you must manage all Teleport components.

To migrate between Teleport plans:

1. Set up a separate Teleport plan, which is either a new cloud-hosted
   Teleport Enterprise account or a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster that
   includes the Auth Service and Proxy Service.
1. Retrieve dynamic Teleport resources from the Auth Service backend on the
   original cluster and apply them against the Auth Service backend on the
   new cluster.
1. Reconfigure Teleport Agents and plugins to connect to the new Teleport
   cluster.
1. Verify that the migration has succeeded.

Teleport Community Edition contains a small subset of Teleport features to
enable users to try out Teleport. This guide assumes that you are *not*
migrating from Teleport Enterprise to Teleport Community Edition.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Teleport cluster.
- The `tsh` and `tctl` client tools. This guide assumes that you are using
  `tctl` to manage dynamic resources, but it is also possible to use [Teleport
  Terraform provider](infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx) and
  [Kubernetes
  operator](infrastructure-as-code/teleport-operator/teleport-operator-standalone.mdx), in
  addition to custom scripts that use the [Teleport API](api/api.mdx)
  to manage the Teleport Auth Service backend.
- If you are migrating to Teleport Enterprise (Cloud), you must not have an
  account with trusted clusters enrolled. Trusted clusters are not supported in
  cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise accounts. You will not be able to migrate
  trusted cluster resources.

## Step 1/4. Set up your new Teleport plan

1. Determine the `teleport.sh` subdomain you would like to use for your new
   Teleport Enterprise account. 

   If you are migrating to Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) and the license dashboard
   for your self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster is already using your
   desired subdomain, you can contact Teleport Support to free up the domain for
   reuse.

1. [Reach out](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise/) to your Account
   Management team to set up your new Teleport Enterprise account.

1. If you are migrating to a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise account, plan and
   execute the deployment with the help of your Account Management team. To
   assist with this, read the the documentation on [Self-Hosting
   Teleport](deploy-a-cluster/deploy-a-cluster.mdx).

1. Ensure you are running Teleport Enterprise agents with versions that are
   the same major or just one major version lower than the new Teleport
   Enterprise account version. To check the  versions of your Teleport 
   Enterprise agents, you can use the `tctl` command
   to list the inventory of connected agents and their version:

   ```code  
   # check for older versions
   $ tctl inventory ls --older-than=<version>
   # check for newer versions
   $ tctl inventory ls --newer-than=<version>
   ```

1. We recommend that Teleport Enterprise (Self-Hosted) customers set up automatic updates to maintain a healthy set of Agents, and require this in Teleport Enterprise (Cloud). See how to 
   [Set up Automatic Agent Updates](../upgrading/automatic-agent-updates.mdx) to
   incorporate this into your migration.


Validate connectivity to both the new Teleport Enterprise cluster and your
original Teleport Enterprise cluster. You should be able to connect to both
Teleport clusters and execute `tctl` commands using your current credentials.

1. Log in to the original Teleport cluster:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="enterprise.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   $ tctl status
   ```

1. Log in to the new Teleport Enterprise cluster:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="example.teleport.sh" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   $ tctl status
   ```

1. Subscribe to the [Teleport Enterprise status
   website](https://status.teleport.sh/) to stay current on any issues impacting
   the performance of your new cluster.

<Notice
  type="danger"
>

  If you are migrating to a Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) cluster, ensure that the
  recovery codes displayed when you first set up your Teleport Enterprise
  (Cloud) account are saved securely, so as not to lose access. For your
  security, Teleport Support cannot assist with resetting passwords or
  recovering lost credentials.

</Notice>

## Step 2/4. Migrate Teleport resources

After ensuring that both your original and new Teleport clusters are up and
running, you can migrate dynamic Teleport resources from one cluster to the
next.

Dynamic Teleport resources such as roles and local users are stored on the
Teleport Auth Service backend. Since your original Teleport cluster uses a
separate Auth Service backend from your new cluster, you must retrieve the
resources on the first backend, then re-apply them against the second backend.

Review the [dynamic resources](../reference/resources.mdx) list to see if any
other resources need to be migrated. Some common dynamic resources includes:

- `windows_desktop`
- `apps`
- `dbs`
- `login_rule`

If you are using infrastructure-as-code tools to 
To achieve this:

1. Log in to your original Teleport cluster and export a collection of the
   above-mentioned dynamic resource configuration using the `tctl`
   administrative tool. An example is shown below:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=admin@example.com
   $ tctl get roles > roles.yaml 
   $ tctl get users > users.yaml 
   ```

1. Once you have the resource configuration file from the above, proceed to log
   in to your new Teleport Enterprise account with an admin user and create the
   resources from the exported files:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=example.teleport.sh --user=admin@example.com
   $ tctl create -f roles.yaml
   $ tctl create -f user.yaml
   ```

<Notice type="tip">

We recommend managing dynamic resources with the Teleport Terraform provider or
Kubernetes operator. In this case, you can configure these tools to manage
dynamic resources on your new Teleport cluster.

</Notice>

For your SSO auth connector, most SSO integrations only work for a single
configured endpoint. It is recommended to create a separate SSO connector in
your Identity Provider specifically for the new Teleport Enterprise endpoint,
and configure a new Auth Connector in the new Teleport Enterprise tenant.

## Step 3/4. Migrate Teleport services and plugins

To migrate services such as Teleport agents, Machine ID Bots, and plugins, start
by cataloging the various services you're managing with Teleport. The following
resources should be considered for migration:

 - Teleport agents 
 - Machine ID Bots
 - Access Request plugins
 - The Teleport Event Handler

Before migrating services, make sure you are logged in to your new Teleport
Enterprise account.

You can migrate Teleport services all at once or gradually, depending on your
business requirements. If running Teleport at scale, you'll generally want to
use a configuration management tool to automate and streamline the process of
carrying out the actions involved in migrating agent configurations. 

### Migrate Teleport agents

To migrate Teleport agents:

1. For each Agent and Machine ID Bot, obtain a valid join token. We recommend
   using a [delegated join
   method](../reference/join-methods.mdx).

1. If using ephemeral tokens, ensure you specify the appropriate token type to
   match the Teleport services. Token types can include `node`, `app`, `kube`,
   `db`, `windowsdesktop` and others depending on the service you wish to join
   to your Teleport Cluster.

1. In the following example, a new token is created with the TTL of fifteen
   minutes:

   ```code
   $ tctl tokens add --type node,app,db --ttl 15m
   ```

   In this command, we assigned the token the `node`, `app` and `db` type,
   indicating that it will allow an agent to join which is running the Teleport
   `ssh_service`, `db_service` and `app_service`.

   Copy the token so you can use it later in this guide.

1. Stop Teleport services on each Agent (if applicable).

1. If you are using Teleport repositories to install on Linux
   update the repository channel to `stable/cloud` for Teleport
   Enterprise (Cloud). For self-hosted Teleport Enterprise you can use the major version
   `stable/v(=teleport.major_version=)` or if you are using automatic
   upgrades the `stable/rolling` channel has all released versions.


1. If you are using Teleport Community Edition, [uninstall Teleport](./management/admin/uninstall-teleport.mdx)
   and install the enterprise edition of the `teleport` binary. You can confirm if the binary
   is correct by running `teleport version`. The output will contain the words
   `Teleport Enterprise`. The enterprise edition of the `teleport`
   binary should be used when connecting to Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) or
   Teleport Enterprise (Self-Hosted).



1. Update the `proxy_server` or `auth_servers` field in each Agent configuration
   file to point to the address of your new Teleport Enterprise cluster. By
   default, on Linux servers, the configuration is located in the
   `/etc/teleport.yaml` directory:

   ```yaml
   version: v3
   teleport:
      proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
   ```

   If your Agent configuration does *not* include a `teleport.proxy_server`
   field, and instead has a `teleport.auth_server` or `teleport.auth_servers`
   field, we recommend migrating your configuration to `version: v3` and using
   `teleport.proxy_server`. 

   With the `teleport.proxy_server` field, the Agent attempts to connect to the
   Teleport cluster using a single mode, rather than multiple modes, which takes
   less time and involves less functionality to troubleshoot.

1. Update the `auth_token` or `join_params.token_name` field with the newly
   generated token.

   ```yaml
   teleport:
     join_params:
       method: token
       token_name: new-token-goes-here
   ```

1. On Linux servers, delete the local Agent cache and restart the Teleport process 
   on each Agent to force the Agent to rejoin the new Teleport Enterprise cluster. 
   By default, the data is located in the  `/var/lib/teleport` directory:

   ```code
   rm -rf /var/lib/teleport
   ```

1. If you are using the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart, wipe out existing
   state and recycle the Kubernetes pod to rejoin the Kubernetes Agent(s) to the
   new cluster.  This will cause the Agents to re-register with the new Teleport
   Enterprise cluster and obtain new certificates signed by the new cluster's
   certificate authority.

   ```code
   # get the release name
   helm -n <namespace> ls
   # delete the state secret
   kubectl -n <namespace> delete secret <release-name>-0-state
   ```
   The settings for the new Teleport Kubernetes Agent should have the 
   `enterprise` value set to true.

### Migrate Machine ID Bots

In general, you can migrate a Machine ID Bot using the following steps:

1. Obtain a new join token.
1. In the `tbot` configuration file, edit the `proxy_server` configuration field
   to point to the new Teleport cluster address and port `443`.
1. Restart `tbot`.

To learn how to restart and configure a Machine ID Bot in your infrastructure,
read the [full documentation](../enroll-resources/machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx) on deploying a
Machine ID Bot.

### Access Request plugins and the Event Handler

In general, you can migrate Teleport plugins using the following steps:

1. If you are using Machine ID to produce credentials for the plugin,
   reconfigure the Machine ID Bot to connect to the new Teleport cluster and
   restart the Bot.

   Otherwise, connect to the new Teleport cluster with `tctl` and produce an
   identity file manually, then make it available to the plugin.

1. Reconfigure the plugin by editing the `teleport.address` field of the plugin
   configuration file to point to the address of the new Teleport cluster, with
   port `443`.

1. Restart the plugin.

For specific plugins running in your infrastructure, read the full documentation
on:
- [Access Request plugins](access-controls/access-request-plugins/access-request-plugins.mdx)
- The [Teleport Event Handler](management/export-audit-events/export-audit-events.mdx)

## Step 4/4. Verify end user access and performance

Once you have migrated dynamic resources and reconfigured services to connect to
your new Teleport cluster, ensure that the setup is complete.

1. Validate that all expected resources are present in the Teleport cluster and
   verify their status and connectivity to ensure they are properly registered
   and available for connections. You can either check via the Web UI, or use
   `tctl` to get a list of all resources and verify their registration and
   status. 

   For example, to list all nodes registered with the Teleport Cluster, you can run the command below:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl nodes ls
   ```
   
   Similarly, to list all other registered resources, you can run the commands below:
   
   
   List all registered Kubernetes clusters:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl kube ls
   ```
   
   List all registered databases:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl db ls
   ```
   
   List all registered applications:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl apps ls
   ```
   
   List all registered Windows desktops:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl desktop ls
   ```

1. Ensure that end users have the expected SSO access to your infrastructure.

1. Establish break-glass access procedures to ensure access to infrastructure in
   case your new Teleport Enterprise cluster becomes unavailable.

   For example, you can run OpenSSH with a limited key following our best
   practices on [How to SSH
   properly](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/).
  
  We recommend configuring systemd to start OpenSSH for 5 minutes at boot, then
  shut it down. The master keys should be stored in a secure vault. To break the
  glass, obtain the master key, reboot the server, and connect using an OpenSSH
  client within 5 minutes.
