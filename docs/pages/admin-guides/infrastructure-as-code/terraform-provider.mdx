The Teleport Terraform provider allows Teleport administrators to configure Teleport with Terraform.

## Setup

For instructions on managing users and roles via Terraform, read
the ["Managing users and roles with IaC" guide](managing-resources/user-and-role.mdx).

The provider must obtain an identity to connect to Teleport. The method to obtain it depends on where the Terraform code
is executed. You must pick the correct guide for your setup:

| Guide                                                                                                               | Use-case                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Run the Teleport Terraform provider locally](./terraform-provider/local.mdx)                                       | This is the best way to get started with the Teleport terraform provider, write some initial Terraform code and achieve IaC.                                                                                     |
| [Run the Teleport Terraform provider in CI or a cloud VM](./terraform-provider/ci-or-cloud.mdx)                     | You already have a working Terraform module configuring Teleport and want to run it in CI to benefit from review and audit capabilities from your versioning system (git).                                       |
| [Run the Teleport Terraform provider from a server](./terraform-provider/dedicated-server.mdx)                      | You have a working Terraform code and want to run it on a dedicated server. The server is long-lived, like a bastion or a task runner.                                                                           |
| [Run the Teleport Terraform provider with long-lived credentials.](./terraform-provider/long-lived-credentials.mdx) | This method is discouraged as less secure than the 3 others. This should be used when none of the other methods work in your case (short-lived CI environments that don't have dedicated Teleport join methods). |

## Resource guides

Once you have a functional Teleport Terraform provider, you will want to configure your resources with it. 

You can find the list of supported resources and their fields is
available [in the Terraform reference](../../reference/terraform-provider.mdx).

Some resources have their dedicated Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) step-by step guides such as:
- [Managing Users And Roles With IaC](managing-resources/user-and-role.mdx)
- [Creating Access Lists with IaC](managing-resources/access-list.mdx)
- [Registering Agentless OpenSSH Servers with IaC](managing-resources/agentless-ssh-servers.mdx)

Finally, you can [import your existing resources in Terraform](terraform-provider/import-existing-resources.mdx).
