title: "Terraform Starter Setup"
description: Provides an example to help you get started managing dynamic resources in a Teleport cluster using Terraform.
---

The Terraform starter guide provides an example of a Terraform module that
manages Teleport resources in production. The guide helps you to understand the
Teleport resources to manage with Terraform in order to accomplish common
Teleport setup tasks. You can use the example module as a starting point for
managing a complete set of Teleport cluster resources.

The guides in the Terraform starter module assume that you have followed [Machine
ID with the Teleport Terraform Provider](
../../enroll-resources/machine-id/access-guides/terraform.mdx) on your
workstation.

## Part One: Enroll resources

In Part One of the Terraform starter module, we show you how to enroll resources
such as Linux servers, databases, and Kubernetes clusters by deploying a pool of
Teleport Agents on virtual machine instances. You can then declare dynamic
infrastructure resources with Terraform or change the configuration file
provided to each Agent.

[Read Part One](./terraform-starter/enroll-resources.mdx).

## Part Two: Configure RBAC

Part Two of the Terraform starter module shows you how to configure Teleport
role-based access controls to provide different levels of access to the
resources you enrolled in Part One. It also configures Access Requests,
available in Teleport Identity, so that users authenticate with less privileged
roles by default but can request access to more privileged roles. An
authentication connector lets users authenticate to Teleport using a Single
Sign-On provider.
