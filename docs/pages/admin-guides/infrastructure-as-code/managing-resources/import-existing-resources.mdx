title: Import Teleport Resources into Terraform
description: How to import your existing Teleport resources into Terraform
---

This guide shows you how to import existing dynamic Teleport resources as
Terraform resources.

If you already created Teleport resources using another client tool like `tctl`
or the Kubernetes Operator, and want to manage all Teleport resources using your
Terraform configuration, follow these steps to generate a `.tf` file that
contains `resource` blocks that represent your existing Teleport resources.

By defining all Teleport resources in one place, you can help ensure that your
cluster configuration matches your expectations.

## Step 1/3. Add an `import` block

1. On your workstation, navigate to your root Teleport Terraform module.

1. Open a file in your text editor to configure Terraform imports. To keep your
   configuration tidy, open a new file called `imports.tf`.

1. Add an `import` block to `imports.tf`. Use the `to` field to indicate the
   name of the resource you want to generate configuration for in Terraform. The
   following example imports a Teleport role called `myrole`:

   ```hcl
   import {
     to = teleport_role.myrole
   }
   ```

## Step 2/3. Retrieve the ID of your resource

1. Retrieve the ID of the resource. The method to use depends on the resource
   type. Use the following rules to do so:

   If the resource is `teleport_provision_token`, the ID is the `metadata.id` of
   the resource.

   If the resource can only have one instance, use the name of the resource type
   without the `teleport` prefix. For example:

   | Resource                              | ID                           |
   |---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
   | `teleport_cluster_maintenance_config` | `cluster_maintenance_config` |
   | `teleport_cluster_networking_config`  | `cluster_networking_config`  |

   For all other resources, the ID is always the `metadata.name` of the resource.

   For example, the `teleport_role` resource uses the role's `metadata.name`
   field for its ID. To find all possible role IDs, run the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl get roles --format json | jq '.[].metadata.name'
   ```

1. In the `import` block, assign the `id` field to the resource ID you retrieved
   earlier. For example, to import a Teleport role with a `metadata.name` of
   `myrole`, add the following:

   ```diff
     import {
       to = teleport_role.myrole
   +   id = "myrole"
     }
   ```

## Step 3/3. Generate a configuration file

1. Generate a resource configuration

   ```code
   $ terraform plan -generate-config-out=imported-resources.tf
   ```

1. Inspect the resulting file, `imported-resources.tf`. If the new `resource`
   block looks correct, you can check the file into source control.

  Provider to create Teleport users and grant them roles.
