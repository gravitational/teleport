title: Managing Users And Roles With IaC
description: Use infrastructure-as-code tooling to create Teleport users and roles.
---

In this guide, you will see how to create users and grant them roles through
infrastructure as code (IaC). Teleports supports three ways to dynamically
create resources from code:

- The Teleport Kubernetes Operator, which allows you to manage Teleport resources
  from Kubernetes
- The Teleport Terraform Provider, which allows you to manage Teleport resources
  via Terraform
- The `tctl` CLI, which allows you to manage Teleport resources from your local
  computer or your CI environment

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you must have:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tctl">

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

A running operator by following either:
- [the guide to enable the operator in the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart](../teleport-operator/teleport-operator-helm.mdx).
- [the guide to setup a standalone operator](../teleport-operator/teleport-operator-standalone.mdx).

You must also set the namespace in which you deployed the operator as this is
the namespace where you will deploy the CustomResources:

```code
# for operators deployed with the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart
$ export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE="teleport-cluster"

# for standalone operators
$ export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE="teleport-iac"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

A functional Teleport Terraform provider by following [the Terraform provider guide](../terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 1/4. Write manifests

In this step, we'll write text files describing the resources we want in
Teleport. Those files are called manifests and their syntax will vary based on
the IaC tooling you'll use.

Those manifests are typically versioned in a shared revision system like git.
This allows you to keep track of all changes, follow standard code review
procedures before changing resources in Teleport, and quickly redeploy your
Teleport instance if needed.

### Write role manifests

We will create 2 roles:

- `manager` allows listing users and roles, as well as reviewing audit events and
  session contents.
- `engineer` grants access to dev and staging servers.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tctl">

Create the following `roles.yaml` file:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['user', 'role']
        verbs: ['list','read']
      - resources: ['session', 'event']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
---
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: engineer
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['root', 'ubuntu', '{{internal.logins}}']
    node_labels:
      'env': ['test', 'staging']
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

Create the following `roles.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v1
kind: TeleportRoleV7
metadata:
  name: manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['user', 'role']
        verbs: ['list','read']
      - resources: ['session', 'event']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
---
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v1
kind: TeleportRoleV7
metadata:
  name: engineer
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ['root', 'ubuntu', '{{internal.logins}}']
    node_labels:
      'env': ['test', 'staging']
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Kubernetes validates all custom resource names to follow RFC 1123, which
  includes specifications for hostnames. This requires the `metadata.name` field
  of Teleport resources controlled by the operator to consist of lowercase
  alphanumeric characters, `-` or `.`, and to start and end with an alphanumeric
  character.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

Create the following `roles.tf` file:

```hcl
resource "teleport_role" "manager" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name = "manager"
  }

  spec = {
    allow = {
      rules = [
        {
          resources = ["user", "role"]
          verbs     = ["list", "read"]
        },
        {
          resources = ["session", "event"]
          verbs     = ["list", "read"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

resource "teleport_role" "engineer" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name = "engineer"
  }

  spec = {
    allow = {
      logins = ["root", "ubuntu", "{{internal.logins}}"]
      node_labels = {
        env = ["test", "staging"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Write user manifests

We will create 2 users:
- Bob, an engineer with the `engineer` role.
- Alice, an engineering manager with both `manager` and `engineer` roles.

<Admonition type="note">
  Users created from manifests are local users, as opposed to users coming from
  an external SAML/OIDC/GitHub Identity Provider (IdP).

  See [the user type reference](../../../reference/user-types.mdx) for more details.
</Admonition>

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tctl">

Create the file `users.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  roles: ['manager', 'engineer']
---
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: bob
spec:
  roles: ['engineer']
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

Create the file `users.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v2
kind: TeleportUser
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  roles: ['manager', 'engineer']
---
apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v2
kind: TeleportUser
metadata:
  name: bob
spec:
  roles: ['engineer']

<TabItem label="Terraform">

Create the file `users.tf` with the following content:

```hcl
resource "teleport_user" "alice" {
  version = "v2"
  metadata = {
    name        = "alice"
  }

  spec = {
    # referencing to the teleport_role resource name instead of using plain
    # strings tells Terraform that the user depends on the role. Thanks to this,
    # Terraform will create the role first and won't let you remove the role
    # if it is still assigned to a user (which is illegal in Teleport).
    roles = [
      teleport_role.manager.metadata.name,
      teleport_role.engineer.metadata.name,
    ]
  }
}

resource "teleport_user" "bob" {
  version = "v2"
  metadata = {
    name        = "bob"
  }

  spec = {
    roles = [teleport_role.engineer.metadata.name]
  }
}
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/4. Apply all manifests

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="tctl">

```code
$ tctl create -f roles.yaml
role 'manager' has been created
role 'engineer' has been created

$ tctl create -f users.yaml
user "alice" has been created
user "bob" has been created
```

<Admonition type="note">
The user resource depends on roles, you must create roles before users as a user
with a non-existing role is invalid and might be rejected by Teleport.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

```code
$ kubectl apply -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" -f roles.yaml
teleportrolev7.resources.teleport.dev/manager created
teleportrolev7.resources.teleport.dev/engineer created

$ kubectl apply -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE" -f users.yaml 
teleportuser.resources.teleport.dev/alice created
teleportuser.resources.teleport.dev/bob created
```

List the created Kubernetes resources:

```code
$ kubectl get teleportrolev7 -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE"
# NAME       AGE
# engineer   10m
# manager    10m

$ kubectl get teleportusers -n "$OPERATOR_NAMESPACE"
# NAME     AGE
# alice    10m
# bob      10m
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

```code
$ terraform plan
[...]
Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

$ terraform apply
teleport_role.engineer: Creating...
teleport_role.manager: Creating...
teleport_role.engineer: Creation complete after 0s [id=engineer]
teleport_role.manager: Creation complete after 0s [id=manager]
teleport_user.bob: Creating...
teleport_user.alice: Creating...
teleport_user.bob: Creation complete after 0s [id=bob]
teleport_user.alice: Creation complete after 0s [id=alice]

Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/4. Validate users were created

Now that the IaC tooling has run, we'll validate that the users were properly
created and granted the correct roles.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Via the UI">

If you have UI access, connect to your Teleport cluster Web UI, select the "Users" tab.

Two new users `alice` and `bob` should be present.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Via CLI">

```code
$ tctl users ls
User                          Roles
----------------------------- -------------------------
@teleport-access-approval-bot @teleport-access-approver
alice                         manager,engineer
bob                           engineer
bot-operator                  bot-operator

# alternatively you can inspect the users details by doing
$ tctl get user/alice
kind: user
metadata:
  id: 1704849160091933780
  labels:
    teleport.dev/origin: kubernetes
  name: alice
spec:
  created_by:
    time: "2024-01-10T01:12:40.088581806Z"
    user:
      name: bot-operator
  expires: "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  roles:
  - manager
  - engineer
  status:
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    locked_time: "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    recovery_attempt_lock_expires: "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
version: v2
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/4. Create a password reset link

At this point, the local users have been created in Teleport. However, we never
specified any password or additional authentication factors. You must issue a
password reset link for the users to finish their Teleport registration and be
able to log in Teleport.

User reset links contain single-use expiring tokens. Because of this, you cannot
follow the same declarative approach as for other Teleport resources and
generate them via a manifest. You need to create those tokens once after the
user creation, and securely send them to the end-user for them to register their
password/MFA.

### Option 1: Reset via CLI
You can manually reset a user password via `tctl` by doing:

```code
$ tctl users reset alice
User "alice" has been reset. Share this URL with the user to complete password reset, link is valid for 8h:
https://teleport.example.com:443/web/reset/05b420fdc784597cbbb1d2ba65697cd8

NOTE: Make sure teleport.example.com:443 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

### Option 2: Automating user reset

If you have a way to securely send reset links to the users, you can build
automation to fit your organization's specific needs. For example:

```
$ tctl users reset alice --format=json | \
    jq '"Sending an email to " + .spec.user +" that contains the link: " + .spec.url'
```

You must replace the `jq` command by something that actually sends the link over
a secure channel. This channel will depend on your organization. It is usually a
direct message or an email.

<Admonition type="tip" title="For Terraform users">

You can trigger your custom script on Terraform resource creation with
[the `local-exec` provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec).

```hcl
resource "teleport_user" "bob" {
  version = v2
  metadata = {
    name = "bob"
  }

  spec = {
    roles = [teleport_role.engineer.metadata.name]
  }
  
  # on user creation, trigger a reset flow and send the link via 
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "tctl users reset alice --format=json | jq '\"Sending an email to \" + .spec.user +\" that contains the link: \" + .spec.url'"
  }
}

```

</Admonition>

## Next steps

- Allow users with the `manager` role to grant access to production servers to
  some `engineers` via Access Lists. Manager will need to justify and review
  granted access periodically.
  See [the AccessList documentation](../../../identity-governance/access-lists/access-lists.mdx) for
  a high-level explanation of the feature,
  and [the AccessList IaC guide](access-list.mdx) for a step by step IaC
  AccessList setup.
- Allow users with the `engineer` role to request temporary access to
  production, and have users with the `manager` role validate the requests.
  See [the Access Requests documentation](../../../identity-governance/access-requests/access-requests.mdx)
- You can see all supported fields in the references
  of [the user resource](../../../reference/resources.mdx)
  and [the role resource](../../../reference/resources.mdx).
