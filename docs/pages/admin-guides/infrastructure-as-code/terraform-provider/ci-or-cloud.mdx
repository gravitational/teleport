title: Run the Teleport Terraform Provider in CI or Cloud
description: How to manage dynamic resources using the Teleport Terraform provider from your CI pipelines or Cloud provider.
---

This guides covers how to run the Teleport Terraform Provider from:

- your CI/CD pipelines on:
  - GitHub Actions (we'll use the `github` join method)
  - GitlabCI (we'll use the `gitlab` join method)
  - CircleCI (we'll use the `circleci` join method)
- a cloud VM on:
  - AWS (we'll use the `aws` join method)
  - GCP (we'll use the `gcp` join method)

<Admonition type="note">
Running the Terraform provider with native MachineID is supported on Azure, inside a Kubernetes pod,
and on servers with Trusted Platform Module (TPM). While those setups are not described in details in this guide,
you can follow their regular MachineID guides and replace the "Configure `tbot`" step by passing the
join method and token to the provider.

- [Azure MachineID guide](../../../enroll-resources/machine-id/deployment/azure.mdx)
- [Kubernetes MachineID guide](../../../enroll-resources/machine-id/deployment/kubernetes.mdx)
- [TPM MachineID guide](../../../enroll-resources/machine-id/deployment/linux-tpm.mdx)

HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) and self-hosted Terraform Enterprise are
supported but require special configuration, so refer to our
[dedicated guide](./terraform-cloud.mdx).
</Admonition>

This guide does not cover running Teleport locally, on a dedicated server or on
certain platforms. See the following more specific guides for those cases:
- [Run the Terraform Provider locally](./local.mdx)
- [Run the Teleport Terraform Provider on a server](./dedicated-server.mdx)
- [Run the Teleport Terraform Provider on Spacelift](./spacelift.mdx)

## How it works

This setup asks the runtime (the CI/CD system, cloud provider, container engine, ...) for an identity
proof. This proof is then used directly by the Terraform provider to connect to Teleport and obtain credentials.
In this setup, there is no `tbot` daemon involved as the Terraform provider can natively obtain the identity proof
and join the Teleport cluster.

The setup only works for select runtimes which Teleport
has [a delegated join method](../../../reference/join-methods.mdx#delegated-join-methods) for (e.g. GitHub Actions,
GitLab CI, ...)

## Prerequisites

You need either:
- A GCP or AWS VM with terraform installed
- A git repo able to run GitHub Actions, GitLab CI or CircleCI jobs

You also need:

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Create the Terraform provider bot

In this step you will create [a bot](../../../reference/architecture/machine-id-architecture.mdx#what-is-a-bot) named `terraform`.

Create a file named `terraform-bot.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: bot
version: v1
metadata:
  name: terraform
spec:
  # The terraform-provider is a default role shipped in Teleport granting access
  # to every resource supported by the terraform provider.
  roles: ["terraform-provider"]
```

Then apply it with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create terraform-bot.yaml

This is an admin-level action and requires MFA to complete
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap
bot "terraform" has been created
```

At this point, you should see your new bot:
```code
$ tctl bots ls

Bot       User          Roles
--------- ------------- ------------------
terraform bot-terraform terraform-provider
```

## Step 2/4. Create the bot join token

In this step you will create a token allowing a process to connect to Teleport as the `terraform` bot you created
earlier.

The token type and configuration depends on where the Terraform provider is running.
See [the joining reference](../../../reference/join-methods.mdx) for more details about the joining process,
the different join methods, types of tokens, and the fields they support.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="GitHub Actions">
To allow the Terraform Provider to join from GitHub Actions workflows in <Var name="organization/repository" />,
create the following `terraform-bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: terraform-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: github
  bot_name: terraform
  github:
    # allow specifies rules that control which GitHub Actions runs will be
    # granted access. Those not matching any allow rule will be denied.
    allow:
    - repository: <Var name="organization/repository"/>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitLab CI">
To allow the Terraform Provider to join from GitLab CI pipelines in <Var name="group/project"/> on
the <Var name="gitlab.example.com" /> GitLab instance, create the following `terraform-bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: terraform-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: gitlab
  bot_name: terraform
  gitlab:
    # domain should be the domain of your GitLab instance. If you are using
    # GitLab's cloud hosted offering, omit this field entirely.
    domain: <Var name="gitlab.example.com" />
    # allow specifies rules that control which GitLab tokens will be accepted
    # by Teleport. Tokens not matching any allow rule will be denied.
    allow:
      - project_path: <Var name="group/project"/>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="CircleCI">

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/recover-circle-ci-claims.mdx!)

Then, create the following `terraform-bot-token.yaml`, replacing <Var
name="context-id" /> with your context ID:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: terraform-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: circleci
  bot_name: terraform
  circleci:
    organization_id: <Var name="organization-id" />
    # allow specifies the rules by which the Auth Service determines if `tbot`
    # should be allowed to join.
    allow:
    - context_id: <Var name="context-id" />
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="AWS">
Make sure you have:
- An AWS IAM role that you wish to grant access to your Teleport cluster. This role must be granted `sts:GetCallerIdentity`. In this guide, this role will be named <Var name="instance-iam-role" />.
- An AWS EC2 virtual machine configured with the IAM role attached where you want to run the Terraform provider.
- The AWS account ID: <Var name="111111111111" />

Then, create the following `terraform-bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: terraform-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  bot_name: terraform
  join_method: iam
  allow:
    - aws_account: "<Var name="111111111111" />"
      aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::<Var name="organization-id" />:assumed-role/<Var name="instance-iam-role" />/i-*"
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GCP">
Make sure you have:
- A GCP Service Account (SA) attached to the VM you want to run the provider on. This cannot be the default compute SA. In this guide, this SA will be named <Var name="my-service-account" />.
- The GCP project ID: <Var name="my-project-123456" />

Then, create the following `terraform-bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: terraform-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  bot_name: terraform
  join_method: gcp
  gcp:
    allow:
    - project_ids:
        - "<Var name="my-project-123456" />"
      service_accounts:
        - "<Var name="my-service-account" />@<Var name="my-project-123456" />.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Create the bot token described by the `terraform-bot-token.yaml` manifest:

```code
$ tctl create -f terraform-bot-token.yaml

This is an admin-level action and requires MFA to complete
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap
provision_token "terraform-bot" has been created
```

## Step 3/4. Configure your Terraform provider


In this step you will write a minimal Terraform code that configures the provider to connect to your Teleport cluster
and join with the token you previously created.

To do this you need:
 - your Teleport cluster domain including the port: <Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />.
   You can find this in the URL when accessing the Web UI.
 - the join method of the token you've created. This is the `spec.join_method` field in the `terraform-bot-token.yaml`:
   <Var name="token-join-method" />.

Create this minimal `main.tf` file:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    teleport = {
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
      version = "~> (=teleport.major_version=).0"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  addr        = "<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />"
  join_method = "<Var name="token-join-method" />"
  join_token  = "terraform-bot"
}

# We must create a test role, if we don't declare resources, Terraform won't try to
# connect to Teleport and we won't be able to validate the setup.
resource "teleport_role" "test" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name        = "test"
    description = "Dummy role to validate Terraform Provider setup"
    labels = {
      test = "yes"
    }
  }

  spec = {}
}
```

## Step 4/4. Run Terraform

This step shows minimal examples on how to run Terraform based on your environment. This code uses the default local
backend which is not fit for production purposes. Especially in CI, you must
use [non-local Terraform backends](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration)
so the Terraform state is persisted across CI pipelines.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="GitHub Actions">
In the repo containing your Terraform code, create a `.github/workflows/teleport-terraform.yaml` file with the
following content:

```yaml
name: Teleport Terraform Demo
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or Machine ID will not be
      # able to authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    name: terraform-plan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # You can find more advanced TF workflows at https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v3
    - name: Terraform Init
      id: init
      run: terraform init
    - name: Terraform Plan
      id: plan
      run: terraform plan -no-color
```

Commit the changes and push to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
You should see a successful Terraform plan in the workflow logs.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitLab CI">

Recover your cluster name:
```code
$ tctl status

Cluster       <Var name="teleport.example.com"/>
Version       16.2.0
# ...
```

In the repo containing your Terraform code, create the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file if it does exist, and add the following
content:

```yaml
stages:
  - plan
image:
  name: hashicorp/terraform:1.9
  entrypoint: [""]
terraform-job:
  stage: plan
  # id_tokens configures ID Tokens that GitLab will automatically inject into
  # the environment of your GitLab run.
  #
  # See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html
  # for further explanation of the id_tokens configuration in GitLab.
  id_tokens:
    TBOT_GITLAB_JWT:
      # aud for TBOT_GITLAB_JWT must be configured with the name of your
      # Teleport cluster. This is not necessarily the address of your Teleport
      # cluster and will not include a port or scheme (http/https)
      #
      # This helps the Teleport Auth Service know that the token is intended for
      # it, and not a different service or Teleport cluster.
      aud: "<Var name="teleport.example.com"/>"
  script:
    - terraform init
    - terraform plan
```

Commit the changes and push to any branch to trigger a Gitlab CI pipeline.
You should see a successful Terraform plan in the pipeline logs.

  deploy_infrastructure:
    jobs:
      - terraform/init:
          tag: 1.9.5
          checkout: true
          context: <Var name="teleport-access" />
      - terraform/plan:
