title: Run the Teleport Terraform Provider on Spacelift
description: How to manage dynamic resources using the Teleport Terraform provider on the Spacelift platform.
---

You can use Spacelift with the Teleport Terraform provider to manage dynamic
configuration resources via GitOps and infrastructure as code. This gives you an
audit trail of changes to your Teleport configuration and a single source of
truth for operators to examine.

This guide shows you how to configure the Teleport Terraform Provider to
authenticate to a Teleport cluster using Machine ID when running on Spacelift.

## How it works

In this setup, the Teleport Terraform Provider proves its identity to the
Teleport Auth Service by presenting an ID token signed by Spacelift. This
allows it to authenticate with the Teleport cluster without the need for a
long-lived shared secret.

While following this guide, you will create a Teleport user and role with no
privileges in order to show you how to use Spacelift to create dynamic
resources. 

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx edition="Teleport Enterprise"!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A GitHub repository where you will store your Terraform configuration and a
  Spacelift stack linked to this repository.
- A paid Spacelift account. This is required to use the `spacelift` join method.
- Your Teleport user should have the privileges to create token resources.

## Step 1/3. Create a role and Machine ID bot

First, we'll create a Machine ID Bot for our Spacelift job to act as. We'll
grant it the `terraform-provider` role, which automatically grants access to
every resource supported by the Teleport terraform provider.

Create `bot.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: bot
version: v1
metadata:
  # name is a unique identifier for the Bot in the cluster.
  name: example
spec:
  # The terraform-provider is a default role shipped in Teleport granting access
  # to every resource supported by the terraform provider.
  roles:
    - terraform-provider
```

Make sure you replace `example` with a unique, descriptive, name for your Bot.

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create bot.yaml
```

## Step 2/3. Create a join token for Spacelift

In order to allow your Spacelift stack to authenticate with your Teleport
cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. A join token sets out
criteria by which the Teleport Auth Service decides whether to allow a bot or
node to join a cluster.

In this example, you will create a join token that grants access to any
execution within a specific Spacelift stack.

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  # The Bot role indicates that this token grants access to a bot user, rather
  # than allowing a node to join. This role is built in to Teleport.
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: spacelift
  # The bot_name indicates which bot user this token grants access to. This
  # should match the name of the bot that you created in the previous step.
  bot_name: example
  spacelift:
    # hostname should be the hostname of your Spacelift tenant.
    hostname: example.app.spacelift.io
    # allow specifies rules that control which Spacelift executions will be
    # granted access. Those not matching any allow rule will be denied.
    allow:
    # space_id identifies the space that the module or stack resides within.
    - space_id: root
      # caller_type is the type of caller_id. This must be `stack` or `module`.
      caller_type: stack
      # caller_id is the id of the caller. e.g the name of the stack or module.
      caller_id: my-stack
```

Replace:
- `example.app.spacelift.io` with the hostname of your Spacelift tenant.
- `my-stack` with the name of the Spacelift stack.
- `root` with the ID of the space that the stack resides within. The
  "space details" panel on the "Spaces" page of the Spacelift UI shows the ID.

Once the resource file has been written, create the token with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

Check that token `example-bot` has been created with the following
command:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token       Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
----------- ---- ------ ----------------------------------------------
example-bot Bot
```

## Step 3/3. Configure your Spacelift stack

### Configure the Terraform Provider

Add the following to a file called `main.tf` to configure the Teleport Terraform
provider and declare two dynamic resources, a user and role:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    teleport = {
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
      version = ">= (=teleport.plugin.version=)"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  addr        = "teleport.example.com:443"
  join_method = "spacelift"
  join_token  = "example-bot"
}

resource "teleport_role" "terraform_test" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name        = "terraform-test"
    description = "Terraform test role"
    labels = {
      test = "true"
    }
  }
}

resource "teleport_user" "terraform-test" {
  metadata = {
    name        = "terraform-test"
    description = "Terraform test user"

    labels = {
      test = "true"
    }
  }

  spec = {
    roles = [teleport_role.terraform_test.id]
  }
}
```

In the `provider` block, change:

- `teleport.example.com:443` to the host and HTTPS port of your Teleport Proxy
  Service.
- `example-bot` to the name of the join token you created earlier.

Commit your changes and push the branch to GitHub, then open a pull request
against the `main` branch. (Do not merge it just yet.)

### Verify that the setup is working

In the Spacelift UI, navigate to your stack, then to **PRs**. Click the name of
the PR you opened.

You should see a Terraform plan that includes the user and role you defined
earlier:

![Terraform plan](../../../../img/management/spacelift/pr-run.png)

When running `terraform plan`, the Teleport Terraform Provider uses Machine ID
to generate the short-lived credentials necessary to authenticate to the
Teleport cluster.

Merge the PR, then navigate to your stack and click **Runs**. Click the status
of the first run, which corresponds to merging your PR, to visit the page for
the run. Click **Confirm** to begin applying your Terraform plan.

You should see output indicating success:

![Successful apply](../../../../img/management/spacelift/apply-success.png)

Verify that Spacelift has created the new user and role by running the following
commands, which should return YAML data for each resource:

```code
$ tctl get roles/terraform-test
$ tctl get users/terraform-test
```

## Next steps

- Now that you know how to manage Teleport configuration resources with
  Terraform and Spacelift, read the [Terraform resource
  reference](../../../reference/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx) so
  you can flesh out your configuration.
- To find out more about Spacelift's OIDC implementation, which Machine ID uses
  to authenticate to your Teleport cluster, read [the Spacelift
  documentation](https://docs.spacelift.io/integrations/cloud-providers/oidc/).
- Learn how you can help achieve secure access for service accounts by sending
  [anonymous Machine ID telemetry](../../../reference/machine-id/telemetry.mdx).
