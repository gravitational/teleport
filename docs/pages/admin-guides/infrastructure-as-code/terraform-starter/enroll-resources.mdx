title: "Part 1: Enroll Infrastructure with Terraform"
h1: "Terraform Starter: Enroll Infrastructure"
description: Explains how to deploy a pool of Teleport Agents so you can apply dynamic resources to enroll your infrastructure with Teleport.
---

*This guide is Part One of the Teleport Terraform starter guide. Read the
[overview](../terraform-starter.mdx) for the scope and purpose of the Terraform
starter guide.*

This guide shows you how to use Terraform to enroll infrastructure resources
with Teleport. You will:

- Deploy a pool of Teleport Agents running on virtual machines.
- Label resources enrolled by the Agents with `env:dev` and `env:prod` so that,
  in [Part Two](rbac.mdx), you can configure Teleport roles to enable access to
  these resources.

## How it works

An Agent is a Teleport instance configured to run one or more Teleport services
in order to proxy infrastructure resources. For a brief architectural overview
of how Agents run in a Teleport cluster, read the [Introduction to Teleport
Agents](../../../enroll-resources/agents/introduction.mdx).

There are several methods you can use to join a Teleport Agent to your cluster,
which we discuss in the [Joining Services to your
Cluster](../../../enroll-resources/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx) guide. In this guide, we will use
the **join token** method, where the operator stores a secure token on the Auth
Service, and an Agent presents the token in order to join a cluster.

No matter which join method you use, it will involve the following Terraform
resources:

- Compute instances to run Teleport services
- A join token for each compute instance in the Agent pool

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx version="16.2.0"!)

<Admonition type="tip">

We recommend following this guide on a fresh Teleport demo cluster so you can
see how an Agent pool works. After you are familiar with the setup, apply the
lessons from this guide to protect your infrastructure. You can get started with
a demo cluster using:
- A demo deployment on a [Linux server](../../../admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/linux-demo.mdx)
- A [Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) trial](https://goteleport.com/signup)

</Admonition>

- An AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure account with permissions to create virtual
  machine instances.
  
- Cloud infrastructure that enables virtual machine instances to connect to the
  Teleport Proxy Service. For example:
  - An AWS subnet with a public NAT gateway or NAT instance
  - Google Cloud NAT
  - Azure NAT Gateway

  In minimum-security demo clusters, you can also configure the VM instances you
  deploy to have public IP addresses.

- Terraform v(=terraform.version=) or higher.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Import the Terraform module

In this step, you will download Terraform modules that show you how to get
started enrolling Teleport resources. These modules are minimal examples of how
Teleport Terraform resources work together to enable you to manage Teleport
Agents. 

After finishing this guide and becoming familiar with the setup, you should
modify your Terraform configuration to accommodate your infrastructure in
production.

1. Navigate to your Terraform project directory.

1. Fetch the Teleport code repository and copy the example Terraform
   configuration for this project into your current working directory. The
   following commands copy the appropriate child module for your cloud provider
   into a subdirectory called `cloud` and HCL configurations for Teleport
   resources into a subdirectory called `teleport`:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="AWS">

   ```code
   $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gravitational/teleport teleport-clone
   $ cp -R teleport-clone/examples/terraform-starter/agent-installation teleport
   $ cp -R teleport-clone/examples/terraform-starter/aws cloud
   $ rm -rf teleport-clone
   ```

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Google Cloud">

   $ rm -rf teleport-clone
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

1. Create a file called `agent.tf` with the following content, which configures
   the child modules you downloaded in the previous step:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="AWS">
   
   ```hcl

     source      = "./teleport"
     agent_count = 1

       env = "dev"
     }

   }
   
   module "agent_deployment" {
     region           = ""
     source           = "./cloud"
     subnet_id        = ""
     userdata_scripts = concat(
       module.agent_installation_dev.userdata_scripts,
       module.agent_installation_prod.userdata_scripts
     )
   }
   ```
   
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Google Cloud">
   
   ```hcl
   module "agent_installation_dev" {
     source      = "./teleport"
     agent_count = 1
     agent_labels = {
       env = "dev"
     }
     proxy_service_address = "teleport.example.com:443"
     teleport_edition      = "cloud"
     teleport_version      = "(=teleport.version=)"

     userdata_scripts = concat(
       module.agent_installation_dev.userdata_scripts,
       module.agent_installation_prod.userdata_scripts
     )
   }
   ```
   
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Azure">
   
   ```hcl
   module "agent_installation_dev" {
     source      = "./teleport"
     agent_count = 1
     agent_labels = {

   }
   
   module "agent_deployment" {
     azure_resource_group = ""
     public_key_path      = ""
     region               = "East US"
     source               = "./cloud"
     subnet_id            = ""
     userdata_scripts     = concat(
       module.agent_installation_dev.userdata_scripts,
       module.agent_installation_prod.userdata_scripts
     )
   }
   ```
   
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

Each of the `agent_installation_*` module blocks produces a number of
installation scripts equal to the `agent_count` input. Each installation script
runs the Teleport SSH Service with a Teleport join token, labeling the Agent
with the key/value pairs specified in `agent_labels`. This configuration passes
all installation scripts to the `agent_deployment` module in order to run them
on virtual machines, launching one VM per script.

As you scale your Teleport usage, you can increase this count to ease the load
on each Agent. 

Edit the `agent_installation_dev` and `agent_installation_prod` blocks in
`agent.tf` as follows:

1. Assign `proxy_service_address` to the host and HTTPS port of your Teleport
   Proxy Service, e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

   <Notice type="tip">
   
   Make sure to include the port.
   
   </Notice>

1. Make sure `teleport_edition` matches your Teleport edition. Assign this to
   `oss`, `cloud`, or `enterprise`. The default is `oss`.

1. If needed, change the value of `teleport_version` to the version of Teleport
   you want to run on your Agents. It must be either the same major version as
   your Teleport cluster or one major version behind.

Edit the `module "agent_deployment"` block in `agent.tf` as follows:

1. If you are deploying your instance in a minimum-security demo environment and
   do not have a NAT gateway, NAT instance, or other method for connecting your
   instances to the Teleport Proxy Service, modify the `module` block to
   associate a public IP address with each Agent instance: 

   ```hcl
   insecure_direct_access=true
   ```

1. Assign the remaining input variables depending on your cloud provider:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="AWS">
   
   1. Assign `region` to the AWS region where you plan to deploy Teleport Agents,
      such as `us-east-1`.
   1. For `subnet_id`, include the ID of the subnet where you will deploy Teleport
      Agents.
   
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Google Cloud">
   
   1. Assign `google_project` to the name of your Google Cloud project and
      `gcp_zone` to the zone where you will deploy Agents, such as `us-east1-b`.

   1. For `subnet_id`, include the name or URI of the Google Cloud subnet where you
      will deploy the Teleport Agents.
   
      The subnet URI has the format:
   
      ```
      projects/PROJECT_NAME/regions/REGION/subnetworks/SUBNET_NAME
      ```
   
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Azure">
   
   1. Assign `azure_resource_group` to the name of the Azure resource group where
      you are deploying Teleport Agents.
   
   1. The module uses `public_key_path` to pass validation, as Azure VMs must
      include an RSA public key with at least 2048 bits. Once the module deploys
      the VMs, a cloud-init script removes the public key and disables OpenSSH. Set
      this input to the path to a valid public SSH key.
   
   1. Assign `region` to the Azure region where you plan to deploy Teleport Agents,
      such as `East US`.
   
   1. For `subnet_id`, include the ID of the subnet where you will deploy Teleport
      Agents. Use the following format:
   
      ```text
      /subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION/resourceGroups/RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/NETWORK_NAME/subnets/SUBNET_NAME
      ```
   
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Step 2/3. Add provider configurations

In this step, you will configure the `terraform-starter` module for your
Teleport cluster and cloud provider.

In your Terraform project directory, ensure that the file called `provider.tf`
includes the following content:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="AWS">

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }

    teleport = {
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
      version = "~> (=teleport.major_version=).0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = AWS_REGION
}

provider "teleport" {
  # Update addr to point to your Teleport Enterprise (managed) tenant URL's host:port
  addr               = PROXY_SERVICE_ADDRESS
  identity_file_path = "terraform-identity/identity"
}
```

Replace the following placeholders:

| Placeholder           | Value                                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWS_REGION            | The AWS region where you will deploy Agents, e.g., `us-east-2`               |
| PROXY_SERVICE_ADDRESS | The host and port of the Teleport Proxy Service, e.g., `example.teleport.sh:443` |

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Google Cloud">
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 5.5.0"
    }

    teleport = {
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
      version = "~> (=teleport.major_version=).0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  project = GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
  region  = GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION
}

provider "teleport" {
  # Update addr to point to your Teleport Enterprise (managed) tenant URL's host:port
  addr               = PROXY_SERVICE_ADDRESS
  identity_file_path = "terraform-identity/identity"
}
```

Replace the following placeholders:

| Placeholder           | Value                                                                        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT| Google Cloud project where you will deploy Agents. |
| GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION | Google Cloud region where you will deploy Agents. |
| PROXY_SERVICE_ADDRESS | The host and port of the Teleport Proxy Service, e.g., `example.teleport.sh:443` |


</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Azure">
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.0.0"
    }

    teleport = {
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
      version = "~> (=teleport.major_version=).0"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  identity_file_path = "terraform-identity/identity"
  # Update addr to point to your Teleport Cloud tenant URL's host:port
  addr               = PROXY_SERVICE_ADDRESS
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

Replace the following placeholders:

|Placeholder|Value|
|---|---|
| PROXY_SERVICE_ADDRESS | The host and port of the Teleport Proxy Service, e.g., `example.teleport.sh:443` |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/3. Verify the deployment

In this step, you will create a Teleport bot to apply your Terraform
configuration. The bot will exist for one hour and will be granted the default
`terraform-provider` role that can edit every resource the TF provider supports.

1. Navigate to your Terraform project directory and run the following command.
   The `eval`command assigns environment variables in your shell to credentials
   for the Teleport Terraform provider:

   ```code
   $ eval "$(tctl terraform env)"
   🔑 Detecting if MFA is required
   This is an admin-level action and requires MFA to complete
   Tap any security key
   Detected security key tap
   ⚙️ Creating temporary bot "tctl-terraform-env-82ab1a2e" and its token
   🤖 Using the temporary bot to obtain certificates
   🚀 Certificates obtained, you can now use Terraform in this terminal for 1h0m0s
   ```

1. Make sure your cloud provider credentials are available to Terraform using
   the standard approach for your organization.

1. Apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```code
   $ terraform init
   $ terraform apply
   ```

1. Once the `apply` command completes, run the following command to verify that
   your Agents have deployed successfully. This command, which assumes that the
   Agents have the `Node` role, lists all Teleport SSH Service instances with
   the `role=agent-pool` label:

   ```code
   $ tsh ls role=agent-pool
   Node Name                  Address    Labels
   -------------------------- ---------- ---------------
   ip-10-1-1-187.ec2.internal ⟵ Tunnel   role=agent-pool
   ip-10-1-1-24.ec2.internal  ⟵ Tunnel   role=agent-pool
   ```

## Further reading: How the module works

In this section, we explain the resources configured in the
`terraform-starter` module.

### Join token

The `terraform-starter` module deploys one virtual machine instance for each
Teleport Agent. Each Agent joins the cluster using a token. We create each token
using the `teleport_provision_token` Terraform resource, specifying the token's
value with a `random_string` resource:

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/agent-installation/token.tf!)
```

When we apply the `teleport_provision_token` resources, the Teleport Terraform
provider creates them on the Teleport Auth Service backend. 

### User data script

Each Teleport Agent deployed by the `terraform-starter` module loads a user
data script that creates a Teleport configuration file for the Agent: 

```text
(!examples/terraform-starter/agent-installation/userdata!)
```

The configuration adds the `role: agent-pool` label to the Teleport SSH Service
on each instance. This makes it easier to access hosts in the Agent pool later.
It also adds the labels you configured using the `agent_labels` input of the
module.

The script makes Teleport the only option for accessing Agent instances by
disabling OpenSSH on startup and deleting any authorized public keys.

### Virtual machine instances

Each cloud-specific child module of `terraform-starter` declares resources to
deploy a virtual machine instance on your cloud provider:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="AWS">

`ec2-instance.tf` declares a data source for an Amazon Linux 2023 machine image
and uses it to launch EC2 instances that run Teleport Agents with the
`teleport_provision_token` resource:

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/aws/ec2-instance.tf!)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Google Cloud">

`gcp-instance.tf` declares Google Compute Engine instances that use the
`teleport_provision_token` to run Teleport Agents:

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/gcp/gcp-instance.tf!)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Azure">

`azure-instance.tf` declares an Azure virtual machine resource to run Teleport
Agents using the `teleport_provision_token` resource, plus the required network
interface for each instance. 

Note that while Azure VM instances require a user account, this module declares
a temporary one to pass validation, but uses Teleport to enable access to the
instances:

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/azure/azure-instance.tf!)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next steps: More options for enrolling resources

In Part One of the Terraform starter guide, we showed you how to use Terraform
to deploy a pool of Teleport Agents in order to enroll infrastructure resources
with Teleport. While the guide showed you how to enroll resources dynamically,
by declaring Terraform resources for each infrastructure resource you want to
enroll, you can protect more of your infrastructure with Teleport by:

- Configuring Auto-Discovery
- Configuring resource enrollment

### Configure Auto-Discovery

For a more scalable approach to enrolling resources than the one shown in this
guide, configure the Teleport Discovery Service to automatically detect
resources in your infrastructure and enroll them with the Teleport Auth Service.

To configure the Teleport Discovery Service:

1. Edit the userdata script run by the Agent instances managed in the Terraform
   starter module. Follow the [Auto-Discovery
   guides](../../../enroll-resources/auto-discovery/auto-discovery.mdx) guides
   to configure the Discovery Service and enable your Agents to proxy the
   resources that the service enrolls.
1. Add the `Discovery` role to the join token resource you created earlier. In
   this guide, the join token only has the `Node` role.
1. Add roles to the join token resource that corresponds to the Agent services
   you want to proxy discovered resources. The roles to add depend on the
   resources you want to automatically enroll based on the [Auto-Discovery
   guides](../../../enroll-resources/auto-discovery/auto-discovery.mdx) guides.

### Enroll resources manually

You can also enroll resources manually, instructing Agents to proxy specific
endpoints in your infrastructure. For information about manual enrollment, read
the documentation section for each kind of resource you would like to enroll:
  
- [Databases](../../../enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx)
- [Windows
  desktops](../../../enroll-resources/desktop-access/desktop-access.mdx)
- [Kubernetes
  clusters](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/kubernetes-access.mdx)
- [Linux servers](../../../enroll-resources/server-access/server-access.mdx)
- [Web applications and cloud provider
  APIs](../../../enroll-resources/application-access/application-access.mdx)

Once you are familiar with the process of enrolling a resource manually, you can
edit your Terraform module to:

1. **Add token roles:** The token resource you created has only the `Node` role,
   and you can add roles to authorize your Agents to proxy additional kinds of
   resources. Consult a guide to enrolling resources manually to determine the
   role to add to the token.
1. **Change the userdata script** to enable additional Agent services additional
   infrastructure resources for your Agents to proxy.
1. **Deploy dynamic resources:** Consult the [Terraform provider
   reference](../../../reference/terraform-provider.mdx) for Terraform resources
   that you can apply in order to enroll dynamic resources in your
   infrastructure.
