title: "Part 2: Configure Teleport RBAC with Terraform"
h1: "Terraform Starter: Configure RBAC"
description: Explains how to manage Teleport roles and authentication connectors with Terraform so you can implement the principle of least privilege in your infrastructure.
---

*This guide is Part Two of the Teleport Terraform starter guide. Read the
[overview](terraform-starter.mdx) for the scope and purpose of the Terraform
starter guide.*

In [Part One](enroll-resources.mdx) of this series, we showed you how to use
Terraform to deploy Teleport Agents in order to enroll infrastructure resources
with your Teleport cluster. While configuring Agents, you labeled them based on
their environment, with some falling under `dev` and others under `prod`. 

In this guide, you will configure your Teleport cluster to manage access to
resources with the `dev` and `prod` labels in order to implement the principle
of least privilege. 

## How it works

This guide shows you how to create:

- A role that can access `prod` resources.
- A role that can access `dev` resources and request access to `prod` resources.
- An authentication connector that allows users to sign into your organization's
  identity provider and automatically gain access to `dev` resources. 

In this setup, the only way to access `prod` resources is with an Access
Request, meaning that there are no standing credentials for accessing `prod`
resources that an attacker can compromise.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have completed [Part 1: Enroll Infrastructure with
Terraform](./enroll-resources.mdx).

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx version="16.2.0"!)

- Resources enrolled with Teleport that include the `dev` and `prod` labels. We
  show you how to enroll these resources using Terraform in Part One.
- An identity provider that supports OIDC or SAML. You should have either:
  - The ability to modify SAML attributes or OIDC claims in your organization.
  - Pre-existing groups of users that you want to map to two levels of access:
    the ability to connect to `dev` resources; and the ability to review Access
    Requests for `prod` access.

<Admonition type="tip">

We recommend following this guide on the same Teleport demo cluster you used for
Part One. After you are familiar with the setup, you can apply the lessons from
this guide to manage RBAC with Terraform.

</Admonition>

- Terraform v(=terraform.version=) or higher.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- To help with troubleshooting, we recommend completing the setup steps in this
  guide with a local user that has the preset `editor` and `auditor` roles. In
  production, you can apply the lessons in this guide using a less privileged
  user.

## Step 1/4. Import Terraform modules

In this step, you will download Terraform modules that show you how to get
started managing Teleport RBAC. These modules are minimal examples of how
Teleport Terraform resources work together to enable you to manage Teleport
roles and authentication connectors. 

After finishing this guide and becoming familiar with the setup, you should
modify your Terraform configuration to accommodate your infrastructure in
production.

1. Navigate to the directory where you organized files for your root Terraform
   module.

1. Fetch the Teleport code repository and copy the example Terraform
   configuration for this project into your current working directory. 

   Since you will enable users to authenticate to Teleport through your
   organization's identity provider (IdP), the modules depend on whether your
   organization uses OIDC or SAML to communicate with services:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="OIDC">

   ```code
   $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gravitational/teleport teleport-clone --branch=branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)
   $ cp -R teleport-clone/examples/terraform-starter/env_role env_role
   $ cp -R teleport-clone/examples/terraform-starter/oidc oidc
   $ rm -rf teleport-clone
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="SAML">

   ```code
   $ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gravitational/teleport teleport-clone --branch=branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)
   $ cp -R teleport-clone/examples/terraform-starter/env_role env_role
   $ cp -R teleport-clone/examples/terraform-starter/saml saml
   $ rm -rf teleport-clone
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

   Your project directory will include two new modules: 

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="OIDC">

   |Name|Description|
   |---|---|
   |`env_role`|A module for a Teleport role that grants access to resources with a specific `env` label.|
   |`oidc`|Teleport resources to configure an OIDC authentication connector and require that users authenticate with it.|

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="SAML">

   |Name|Description|
   |---|---|
   |`env_role`|A module for a Teleport role that grants access to resources with a specific `env` label.|
   |`saml`|Teleport resources to configure a SAML authentication connector and require that users authenticate with it.|

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

1. Create a file called `rbac.tf` that includes the following `module` blocks: 

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="OIDC">

   ```hcl
   module "oidc" {
     source               = "./oidc"
     oidc_claims_to_roles = []
     oidc_client_id       = ""
     oidc_connector_name  = "Log in with OIDC"
     oidc_redirect_url    = ""
     oidc_secret          = ""
     teleport_domain      = ""
   }
   
   module "prod_role" {
     source        = "./env_role"
     env_label     = "prod"
     principals    = {}
     request_roles = []
   }

   module "dev_role" {
     source        = "./env_role"
     env_label     = "dev"
     principals    = {}
     request_roles = [module.prod_role.role_name]
   }
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="SAML">

   ```hcl
   module "saml" {
     source                   = "./saml"
     saml_connector_name      = "Log in with SAML"
     saml_attributes_to_roles = []
     saml_acs                 = ""
     saml_entity_descriptor   = ""
     teleport_domain          = ""
   }
   
   module "prod_role" {
     source        = "./env_role"
     env_label     = "prod"
     principals    = {}
     request_roles = []
   }
   
   module "dev_role" {
     source        = "./env_role"
     env_label     = "dev"
     principals    = {}
     request_roles = [module.prod_role.role_name]
   }
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

Next, we will show you how to configure the two child modules, and walk you
through the Terraform resources that they apply.

## Step 2/4. Configure role principals

Together, the `prod_role` and `dev_role` modules you declared in Step 1 create
three Teleport roles:

|Role|Description|
|---|---|
|`prod_access`|Allows access to infrastructure resources with the `env:prod` label.|
|`dev_access`|Allows access to infrastructure resources with the `env:dev` label, and Access Requests for the `prod_access` role.|
|`prod_reviewer`|Allows reviews of Access Requests for the `prod_access` role.|

When Teleport users connect to resources in your infrastructure, they assume a
principal, such as an operating system login or Kubernetes user, in order to
interact with those resources. In this step, you will configure the `prod_role`
and `dev_role` modules to grant access to principals in your infrastructure.

In `rbac.tf`, edit the `prod_role` and `dev_role` blocks so that the
`principals` field contains a mapping, similar to the example below. Use the
list of keys below the example to configure the principals.

```hcl
module "prod_role" {
  principals = {
    KEY = "value"
  }
  // ...
}

// ...
```

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|`aws_role_arns`|AWS role ARNs the user can access when authenticating to an AWS API.|
|`azure_identities`|Azure identities the user can access when authenticating to an Azure API.|
|`db_names`|Names of databases the user can access within a database server.|
|`db_roles`|Roles the user can access on a database when they authenticate to a database server.|
|`db_users`|Users the user can access on a database when they authenticate to a database server.|
|`gcp_service_accounts`|Google Cloud service accounts the user can access when authenticating to a Google Cloud API.|
|`kubernetes_groups`|Kubernetes groups the Teleport Database Service can impersonate when proxying requests from the user.|
|`kubernetes_users`|Kubernetes users the Teleport Database Service can impersonate when proxying requests from the user.|
|`logins`|Operating system logins the user can access when authenticating to a Linux server.|
|`windows_desktop_logins`|Operating system logins the user can access when authenticating to a Windows desktop.|

For example, the following configuration allows users with the `dev_access` role
to assume the `dev` login on Linux hosts and the `developers` group on
Kubernetes. `prod` users have more privileges and can assume the `root` login
and `system:masters` Kubernetes group:

```hcl
module "dev_role" {
  principals = {
    logins            = ["dev"]
    kubernetes_groups = ["developers"]
  }
  // ...
}

module "prod_role" {
  principals = {
    logins            = ["root"]
    kubernetes_groups = ["system:masters"]
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Step 3/4. [Optional] Configure the single sign-on connector

In this step, you will configure your Terraform module to enable authentication
through your organization's IdP. Configure the `saml` or `oidc` module you
declared in Step 1 by following the instructions.

<Admonition type="tip">

You can skip this step for now if you want to assign the `dev_access` and
`prod_access` roles to local Teleport users instead of single sign-on users. To
do so, you can:

- Import existing `teleport_user` resources and modify them to include the
  `dev_access` and `prod_access` roles (see the
  [documentation](../managing-resources/import-existing-resources.mdx)).
- Create a new `teleport_user` resource that includes the roles
  ([documentation](../managing-resources/user-and-role.mdx).

If you plan to skip this step, make sure to remove the `module "saml"` or
`module "oidc"` block from your Terraform configuration.

</Admonition>

1. Register your Teleport cluster with your IdP as a relying party. The
   instructions depend on your IdP. 

   The following guides show you how to set up your IdP to support the SAML or
   OIDC authentication connector. **Read only the linked section**, since these
   guides assume you are using `tctl` instead of Terraform to manage
   authentication connectors:

   - [AD FS](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/adfs.mdx#step-13-configure-adfs)
   - [GitLab](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/gitlab.mdx#step-14-configure-gitlab)
   - [Google
     Workspace](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/google-workspace.mdx#step-14-configure-google-workspace)
   - [OneLogin](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/one-login.mdx#step-13-create-teleport-application-in-onelogin)
   - [Azure
     AD](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/azuread.mdx#step-13-configure-microsoft-entra-id)
   - [Okta](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/okta.mdx#step-24-configure-okta)

1. Configure the redirect URL (for OIDC) or assertion consumer service (for SAML):

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="OIDC">

   Set `oidc_redirect_url` to
   `https://example.teleport.sh:443/v1/webapi/oidc/callback`, replacing
   `example.teleport.sh` with the domain name of your Teleport cluster. 

   Ensure that `oidc_redirect_url` matches match the URL you configured with
   your IdP when registering your Teleport cluster as a relying party.

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="SAML">

   Set `saml_acs` to `https://example.teleport.sh:443/v1/webapi/saml/acs`,
   replacing `example.teleport.sh` with the domain name of your Teleport
   cluster. 

   Ensure that `saml_acs` matches the URL you configured with your IdP when
   registering your Teleport cluster as a relying party.

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

1. After you register Teleport as a relying party, your identity provider will
   print information that you will use to configure the authentication
   connector. Fill in the information depending on your provider type:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="OIDC">

   Fill in the `oidc_client_id` and `oidc_secret` with the client ID and secret
   returned by the IdP.

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="SAML">

   Assign `saml_entity_descriptor` to the contents of the XML document that
   contains the SAML entity descriptor for the IdP.

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

1. Assign `teleport_domain` to the domain name of your Teleport Proxy Service,
   with no scheme or path, e.g., `example.teleport.sh`. The child module uses
   this to configure WebAuthn for local users. This way, you can authenticate as
   a local user as a fallback if you need to troubleshoot your single sign-on
   authentication connector.

1. Configure role mapping for your authentication connector. When a user
   authenticates to Teleport through your organization's IdP, Teleport assigns
   roles to the user based on your connector's role mapping configuration:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="OIDC">

   In this example, users with a `group` claim with the `developers` value
   receive the `dev_access` role, while users with a `group` claim with the
   value `admins` receive the `prod_reviewer` role:

   ```hcl
        oidc_claims_to_roles = [
          {
            claim = "group"
            value = "developers"
            roles = [
              module.dev_role.role_name
            ]
          },
          {
            claim = "group"
            value = "admins"
            roles = module.dev_role.reviewer_role_names
          }
        ]
   ```

   Edit the `claim` value for each item in `oidc_claims_to_roles` to match the
   name of an OIDC claim you have configured on your IdP. 

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="SAML">

   In this example, users with a `group` attribute with the `developers` value
   receive the `dev_access` role, while users with a `group` attribute with the
   value `admins` receive the `prod_reviewer` role:

   ```hcl
        saml_attributes_to_roles = [
          {
            name  = "group"
            value = "developers"
            roles = [
              module.dev_role.role_name
            ]
          },
          {
            name  = "group"
            value = "admins"
            roles = module.dev_role.reviewer_role_names
          }
        ]
   ```

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

## Step 4/4. Apply and verify changes

In this step, you will create a Teleport bot to apply your Terraform
configuration. The bot will exist for one hour and will be granted the default
`terraform-provider` role that can edit every resource the TF provider supports.

1. Navigate to your Terraform project directory and run the following command.
   The `eval`command assigns environment variables in your shell to credentials
   for the Teleport Terraform provider:

   ```code
   $ eval "$(tctl terraform env)"
   🔑 Detecting if MFA is required
   This is an admin-level action and requires MFA to complete
   Tap any security key
   Detected security key tap
   ⚙️ Creating temporary bot "tctl-terraform-env-82ab1a2e" and its token
   🤖 Using the temporary bot to obtain certificates
   🚀 Certificates obtained, you can now use Terraform in this terminal for 1h0m0s
   ```

1. Make sure your cloud provider credentials are available to Terraform using
   the standard approach for your organization.

1. Apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```code
   $ terraform init
   $ terraform apply
   ```

1. Open the Teleport Web UI in a browser and sign in to Teleport as a user on
   your IdP with the `groups` trait assigned to the value that you mapped to the
   role in your authentication connector. Your user should have the `dev_access`
   role.

   <Admonition type="tip">

   If you receive errors logging in using your authentication connector, log in
   as a local user with permissions to view the Teleport audit log. These is
   available in the preset `auditor` role. Check for error messages in events
   related with the "SSO Login" type.

   </Admonition>

1. Request access to the `prod_access` role through the Web UI. Visit the
   "Access Requests" tab and click "New Request".

1. Sign out of the Web UI and, as a user in a group that you mapped to the
   `prod_access` role, sign in. In the "Access Requests" tab, you should be able
   to see and resolve the Access Request you created.

## Further reading: How the module works

This section describes the resources managed by the `env_role`, `saml`, and
`oidc` child modules. We encourage you to copy and customize these
configurations in order to refine your settings and choose the best reusable
interface for your environment.

### The `env_access` role

The `env_role` child module creates Teleport roles with the ability to access
Teleport-protected resources with the `env` label:

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/env_role/env_role.tf!)
```

The role hardcodes an `allow` rule with the ability to access applications,
databases, Linux servers, Kubernetes clusters, and Windows desktops with the
user-configured `env` label. 

Since we cannot predict which principals are available in your infrastructure,
this role leaves the `aws_role_arns`, `logins`, and other principal-related role
attributes for the user to configure.

The role also configures an `allow` rule that enables users to request access
for the roles configured in the `request_roles` input variable.

An `output` prints the name of the role to allow us to create a dependency
relationship between this role and an authentication connector.

### The `env_access_reviewer` role

If `var.request_roles` in the `env_access` role is nonempty, the `env_role`
module creates a role that can review those roles. This is a separate role to
make permissions more composable:

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/env_role/reviewer.tf!)
```

As with the `env_access` role, there is an output to print the name of the
`env_access_reviewer` role to create a dependency relationship with the
authentication connector.

### Configuring an authentication connector

The authentication connector resources are minimal. Beyond providing the
attributes necessary to send and receive Teleport OIDC and SAML messages, the
connectors configure role mappings based on user-provided values:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="OIDC">

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/oidc/oidc_connector.tf!)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SAML">

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/saml/saml.tf!)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since the role mappings inputs are composite data types, we add a complex type
definition when declaring the input variables for the `oidc` and `saml` child
modules:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="OIDC">

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/oidc/inputs.tf!)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SAML">

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/saml/inputs.tf!)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For each authentication connector, we declare a cluster authentication
preference that enables the connector. The cluster authentication preference
enables local user login with WebAuthn as a secure fallback in case you need to
troubleshoot the single sign-on provider.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="OIDC">

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/oidc/auth_pref.tf!)
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SAML">

```hcl
(!examples/terraform-starter/saml/auth_pref.tf!)
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next steps

Now that you have configured RBAC in your Terraform demo cluster, fine-tune your
setup by reading the comprehensive [Terraform provider
reference](../../../reference/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx).
