title: Deploy Teleport on Kubernetes
description: This guide shows you how to deploy Teleport on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
---

Teleport can provide secure, unified access to your Kubernetes clusters. This
guide will show you how to deploy Teleport on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

While completing this guide, you will deploy one Teleport pod each for the Auth
Service and Proxy Service in your Kubernetes cluster, and a load balancer that
forwards outside traffic to your Teleport cluster. Users can then access your
Kubernetes cluster via the Teleport cluster running within it.

If you are already running the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service on
another platform, you can use your existing Teleport deployment to access your
Kubernetes cluster. [Follow our
guide](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/getting-started.mdx) to connect your Kubernetes
cluster to Teleport.

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

- A registered domain name. This is required for Teleport to set up TLS via
  Let's Encrypt and for Teleport clients to verify the Proxy Service host.

- A Kubernetes cluster hosted by a cloud provider, which is required for the
  load balancer we deploy in this guide. We recommend following this guide on a
  non-production cluster to start.

- A persistent volume that the Auth Service can use for storing cluster state.
  Make sure your Kubernetes cluster has one available:

  ```code
  $ kubectl get pv
  ```

  If there are no persistent volumes available, you will need to either provide
  one or enable [dynamic volume
  provisioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/#enabling-dynamic-provisioning)
  for your cluster. For example, in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, you can
  configure the [Elastic Block Store Container Storage Interface driver
  add-on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html).

  To tell whether you have dynamic volume provisioning enabled, check for the
  presence of a default `StorageClass`:

  ```code
  $ kubectl get storageclasses
  ```

  <summary>Launching a fresh EKS cluster with eksctl?</summary>

  If you are using `eksctl` to launch a fresh Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
  cluster in order to follow this guide, the following example configuration
  sets up the EBS CSI driver add-on.

  <Admonition type="danger">

  The example configuration below assumes that you are familiar with how `eksctl`
  works, are not using your EKS cluster in production, and understand that you
  are proceeding at your own risk.

  </Admonition>

  Update the cluster name, version, node group size, and region as required:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
  kind: ClusterConfig
  metadata:
    name: my-cluster
    region: us-east-1
    version: "1.23"

  iam:
    withOIDC: true

  addons:
  - name: aws-ebs-csi-driver
    version: v1.11.4-eksbuild.1
    attachPolicyARNs:
    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy

  managedNodeGroups:
    - name: managed-ng-2
      instanceType: t3.medium
      minSize: 2
      maxSize: 3
  ```

  </details>

- The `tsh` client tool v(=teleport.version=)+ installed on your workstation.
  You can download this from our [installation page](../../../installation.mdx).

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/helm-k8s.mdx!)

<Admonition type="warning">

It is worth noting that this guide shows you how to set up Kubernetes access
with the broadest set of permissions. This is suitable for a personal demo
cluster, but if you would like to set up Kubernetes RBAC for production usage,
we recommend getting familiar with the [Teleport Kubernetes RBAC
guide](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx) before you begin.

## Step 1/2. Install Teleport

To deploy a Teleport cluster on Kubernetes, you need to:

1. Install the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart, which deploys the Teleport Auth
   Service and Proxy Service on your Kubernetes cluster.
1. Once your cluster is running, create DNS records that clients can use to
   access your cluster.

### Install the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart

To deploy the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service on your Kubernetes
cluster, follow the instructions below to install the `teleport-cluster` Helm
chart.

1. (!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/helm/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

1. Create a namespace for Teleport and configure its Pod Security Admission,
   which enforces security standards on pods in the namespace:

   ```code
   $ kubectl create namespace teleport-cluster
   namespace/teleport-cluster created
   
   $ kubectl label namespace teleport-cluster 'pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=baseline'
   namespace/teleport-cluster labeled
   ```

1. Set the `kubectl` context to the namespace to save some typing:

   ```code
   $ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=teleport-cluster
   ```

1. Assign <Var name="clusterName" /> to a subdomain of your domain name, e.g.,
   `teleport.example.com`. 

1. Assign <Var name="email" /> to an email address that you will use to receive
   notifications from Let's Encrypt, which provides TLS credentials for the
   Teleport Proxy Service's HTTPS endpoint.

1. Create a Helm values file:

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Open Source" scope="oss">
   
       Write a values file (`teleport-cluster-values.yaml`) which will configure a single node Teleport cluster and
       provision a cert using ACME.
   
       ```code
       $ cat << EOF > teleport-cluster-values.yaml
       clusterName: <Var name="clusterName" />
       proxyListenerMode: multiplex
       acme: true
       acmeEmail: <Var name="email" />
       EOF
       ```
   
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Enterprise" scope={["enterprise"]}>
   
       (!docs/pages/includes/enterprise/obtainlicense.mdx!)
   
       Ensure that your license is saved to your terminal's working directory at
       the path `license.pem`.
   
       Using your license file, create a secret called "license" in the
       `teleport-cluster` namespace:
   
       ```code
       $ kubectl create secret generic license --from-file=license.pem
       secret/license created
       ```
   
       Write a values file (`teleport-cluster-values.yaml`) which will configure a single node Teleport cluster and
       provision a cert using ACME.
   
       ```code
       $ cat << EOF > teleport-cluster-values.yaml
       clusterName: <Var name="clusterName" />
       proxyListenerMode: multiplex
       acme: true
       acmeEmail: <Var name="email" />
       enterprise: true
       EOF
       ```
   
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

1. Install the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart using the values file you wrote:

   ```code
   $ helm install teleport-cluster teleport/teleport-cluster \
     --create-namespace \
     --version (=teleport.version=) \
     --values teleport-cluster-values.yaml
   ```

1. After installing the `teleport-cluster` chart, wait a minute or so and ensure
   that both the Auth Service and Proxy Service pods are running:

   ```code
   $ kubectl get pods
   NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   teleport-cluster-auth-000000000-00000     1/1     Running   0          114s
   teleport-cluster-proxy-0000000000-00000   1/1     Running   0          114s
   ```

### Set up DNS records

In this section, you will enable users and services to connect to your cluster
by creating DNS records that point to the address of your Proxy Service.

The `teleport-cluster` Helm chart exposes the Proxy Service to traffic from the
internet using a Kubernetes service that sets up an external load balancer with
your cloud provider.

Obtain the address of your load balancer by following the instructions below.

1. Get information about the Proxy Service load balancer:

   ```code
   $ kubectl get services/teleport-cluster
   NAME              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)                        AGE
   teleport-cluster  LoadBalancer   10.4.4.73    192.0.2.0        443:31204/TCP                  89s
   ```
   
   The `teleport-cluster` service directs traffic to the Teleport Proxy Service.
   Notice the `EXTERNAL-IP` field, which shows you the IP address or domain name of
   the cloud-hosted load balancer. For example, on AWS, you may see a domain name
   resembling the following:
   
   ```text
   00000000000000000000000000000000-0000000000.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
   ```

1. Set up two DNS records: `teleport.example.com` for all traffic and
   `*.teleport.example.com` for any web applications you will register with
   Teleport. We are assuming that your domain name is `example.com` and
   `teleport` is the subdomain you have assigned to your Teleport cluster.

   Depending on whether the `EXTERNAL-IP` column above points to an IP address or a
   domain name, the records will have the following details:
   
   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="IP Address">
   
   |Record Type|Domain Name|Value|
   |---|---|---|
   |A|`teleport.example.com`|The IP address of your load balancer|
   |A|`*.teleport.example.com`|The IP address of your load balancer|
   
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Domain Name">
   
   |Record Type|Domain Name|Value|
   |---|---|---|
   |CNAME|`teleport.example.com`|The domain name of your load balancer|
   |CNAME|`*.teleport.example.com`|The domain name of your load balancer|
   
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

1. Once you create the records, use the following command to confirm that your
   Teleport cluster is running:

   ```code
   $ curl https://<Var name="clusterName" />/webapi/ping
   {"auth":{"type":"local","second_factor":"on","preferred_local_mfa":"webauthn","allow_passwordless":true,"allow_headless":true,"local":{"name":""},"webauthn":{"rp_id":"teleport.example.com"},"private_key_policy":"none","device_trust":{},"has_motd":false},"proxy":{"kube":{"enabled":true,"listen_addr":"0.0.0.0:3026"},"ssh":{"listen_addr":"[::]:3023","tunnel_listen_addr":"0.0.0.0:3024","web_listen_addr":"0.0.0.0:3080","public_addr":"teleport.example.com:443"},"db":{"mysql_listen_addr":"0.0.0.0:3036"},"tls_routing_enabled":false},"server_version":"(=teleport.version=)","min_client_version":"12.0.0","cluster_name":"teleport.example.com","automatic_upgrades":false}
   ```

## Step 2/2. Create a local user

While we encourage Teleport users to authenticate via their single sign-on
provider, local users are a reliable fallback for cases when the SSO provider is
down. 

In this section, we will  create a local user who has access to Kubernetes group
`system:masters` via the Teleport role `member`. This user also has the built-in
`access` and `editor` roles for administrative privileges.

Paste the following role specification into a file called `member.yaml`:

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/member-role.mdx!)


1. Create the role:

   ```code
   $ kubectl exec -i deployment/teleport-cluster-auth -- tctl create -f < member.yaml
   role 'member' has been created
   ```

1. Create the user and generate an invite link, replacing <Var name="myuser" />
   with the name of the local Teleport user you want to create:

   ```code
   $ kubectl exec -ti deployment/teleport-cluster-auth -- tctl users add <Var name="myuser" /> --roles=member,access,editor
   User "myuser" has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to
   complete user setup, link is valid for 1h:
   
   https://tele.example.com:443/web/invite/(=presets.tokens.first=)
   
   NOTE: Make sure tele.example.com:443 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
   ```

1. Visit the invite link and follow the instructions in the Web UI to activate
   your user.

1. Try `tsh login` with your local user:

   ```code
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="clusterName" />:443 --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   ```

1. Once you're connected to the Teleport cluster, list the available Kubernetes
   clusters for your user:

   ```code
   $ tsh kube ls
   Kube Cluster Name Selected
   ----------------- --------
   tele.example.com
   ```

1. Log in to the Kubernetes cluster. The `tsh` client tool updates your local
kubeconfig to point to your Teleport cluster, so we will assign `KUBECONFIG` to
a temporary value during the installation process. This way, if something goes
wrong, you can easily revert to your original kubeconfig:

   ```code
   $ KUBECONFIG=$HOME/teleport-kubeconfig.yaml tsh kube login <Var name="clusterName" />
   
   $ KUBECONFIG=$HOME/teleport-kubeconfig.yaml kubectl get -n teleport-cluster pods
   NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   teleport-cluster-auth-000000000-00000     1/1     Running   0          26m
   teleport-cluster-proxy-0000000000-00000   1/1     Running   0          26m
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing errors connecting to the Teleport cluster, check the
status of the Auth Service and Proxy Service pods. A successful state should
show both pods running as below:

```code
$ kubectl get pods -n teleport-cluster
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
teleport-cluster-auth-5f8587bfd4-p5zv6    1/1     Running   0          48s
teleport-cluster-proxy-767747dd94-vkxz6   1/1     Running   0          48s
```
If a pod's status is `Pending`, use the `kubectl logs` and `kubectl describe`
commands for that pod to check the status. The Auth Service pod relies on being
able to allocate a Persistent Volume Claim, and may enter a `Pending` state if
no Persistent Volume is available.

The output of `kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp' -A` can
also be useful, showing the most recent events taking place inside the Kubernetes
cluster.

## Next steps

- **Set up Single Sign-On:** In this guide, we showed you how to create a local
  user, which is appropriate for demo environments. For a production deployment,
  you should set up Single Sign-On with your provider of choice. See our [Single
  Sign-On guides](../../access-controls/sso/sso.mdx) for how to do this.
- **Configure your Teleport deployment:** To see all of the options you can set
  in the values file for the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart, consult our
  [reference guide](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster.mdx).
- **Register resources:** You can register all of the Kubernetes clusters in
  your infrastructure with Teleport. To start, read our [Auto-Discovery
  guides](../../../enroll-resources/auto-discovery/kubernetes/kubernetes.mdx) to see how to automatically
  register every cluster in your cloud. You can also register servers,
  databases, applications, and Windows desktops.
- **Fine-tune your Kubernetes RBAC:** While the user you created in this guide
  can access the `system:masters` role, you can set up Teleport's RBAC to enable
  fine-grained controls for accessing Kubernetes resources. See our [Kubernetes
  Access Controls Guide](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx) for more
  information.
