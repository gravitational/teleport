The `teleport-cluster` Helm chart enables you deploy and manage a self-hosted,
high-availability Teleport cluster. This chart launches the Teleport Auth
Service, Teleport Proxy Service, and the Kubernetes infrastructure required to
support these services. The guides in this section show you how to use the
`teleport-cluster` Helm chart in your environment.

You do not need to deploy the Auth Service and Proxy Service on Kubernetes in
order to protect a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport, and it is possible to
enroll a Kubernetes cluster on Teleport Cloud or by running the Teleport
Kubernetes Service on a Linux server. For instructions on enrolling a Kubernetes
cluster with Teleport, read the [Kubernetes
Access](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) documentation.

These guides show you how to manage a self-hosted Teleport deployment using our
`teleport-cluster` Helm chart:
