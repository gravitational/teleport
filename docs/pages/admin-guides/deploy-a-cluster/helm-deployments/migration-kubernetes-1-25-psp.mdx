title: Kubernetes 1.25 and PSP removal
description: How to prepare for the PodSecurityPolicy removal happening in Kubernetes 1.25
---

PodSecurityPolicies (PSPs) were deprecated in Kubernetes 1.22 and are removed
in Kubernetes 1.25. This page explains the security implications of such changes
for Teleport users, and what actions are required.

The two Teleport charts `teleport-cluster` and `teleport-kube-agent` were relying
on PodSecurityPolicies to provide an additional security level for Teleport pods.
Their removal has two main consequences:

- After upgrading to 1.25, Helm can end up with a corrupted state referencing
  PSP objects. In this case, the Helm release state has to be manually fixed.
- Security policy enforcement is managed by PodSecurityAdmission (PSA) since 1.23.
  PSA security level is configured on the `namespace` resource, which Helm doesn't manage.
  You now have to set the security enforcement level as the chart can't do it.

To prepare for the 1.25 upgrade:

- Make sure you are running at least Kubernetes 1.23 (run `kubectl version`)

- Label the namespace you are deploying the chart in with the PSA enforcement level:

  ```code
  $ kubectl label namespace my-teleport-namespace 'pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=baseline'
  
  namespace/my-teleport-namespace labeled
  ```

- Explicitly disable PSP deployment from the chart by setting
  `podSecurityPolicy.enabled: false` and upgrading the Helm release.

Once all the Teleport namespaces are labeled with the adequate PodSecurityStandard,
and all Helm releases have been upgraded at least once with PSP disabled, you
can safely upgrade to 1.25.
