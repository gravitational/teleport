Migrating from a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise deployment to a cloud-hosted

Teleport Enterprise deployment offers scalability, reliability, and ease of
management. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can transition
your Teleport deployment to the cloud successfully while ensuring minimal
disruption to your operations.

## How it works

While in a cloud-hosted Enterprise Teleport account, Teleport manages the Auth
Service and Proxy Service for you, you need to migrate dynamic resources and
Teleport services yourself. 

To migrate a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster to a cloud-hosted Teleport
Enterprise cluster:

1. Set up a separate cloud-hosted Teleport account.
1. Retrieve dynamic Teleport resources from the Auth Service backend on the
   self-hosted cluster and apply them against the Auth Service backend on the
   cloud-hosted cluster.
1. Reconfigure Teleport agents and plugins to connect to the cloud-hosted
   Teleport cluster.
1. Verify that the migration has succeeded.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Teleport Enterprise (self-hosted) cluster.
- The `tsh` and `tctl` client tools. This guide assumes that you are using
  `tctl` to manage dynamic resources, but it is also possible to use [Teleport
  Terraform provider](../infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx) and
  [Kubernetes
  operator](../infrastructure-as-code/teleport-operator/teleport-operator-standalone.mdx), in
  addition to custom scripts that use the [Teleport API](../api/api.mdx)
  to manage the Teleport Auth Service backend.
- An account with no trusted clusters enrolled. Trusted clusters are not
  supported in cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise accounts. You will not be able
  to migrate trusted cluster resources.

## Step 1/4. Deploy your cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster

1. Determine the `teleport.sh` subdomain you would like to use for your new
   cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise account. 

1. If the license dashboard for your self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster is
   already using your desired subdomain, you can contact Teleport Support to
   free up the domain for re-use.

   [Reach out](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise/) to your Account
   Management team to set up your cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise tenant.

1. Ensure you are running Teleport Enterprise agents with versions that are
   lower than the cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise tenant version. To check the
   versions of your Teleport Enterprise agents, you can use the `tctl` command
   to list the inventory of connected agents and their version:

   ```code  
   $ tctl inventory ls --older-than=<version>
   ```

Validate connectivity to both the new cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster
and your self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster. You should be able to connect
to both Teleport clusters and execute `tctl` commands using your current
credentials.

1. Log in to the self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="enterprise.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   $ tctl status
   ```

1. Log in to the cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="example.teleport.sh" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   $ tctl status
   ```

1. Subscribe to the [Teleport Enterprise status
   website](https://status.teleport.sh/) to stay current on any issues impacting
   the performance of your cloud-hosted cluster.

  Ensure that the recovery codes displayed when you first set up your
  cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise tenant are saved securely, so as not to lose
  access. For your security, Teleport Support cannot assist with resetting
  passwords or recovering lost credentials.

</Admonition>

## Step 2/4. Migrate Teleport resources

After ensuring that both your self-hosted and cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise
clusters are up and running, you can migrate dynamic Teleport resources from one
cluster to the next.

Dynamic Teleport resources such as roles and local users are stored on the
Teleport Auth Service backend. Since your self-hosted Teleport Enterprise
cluster uses a separate Auth Service backend from your cloud-hosted cluster, you
must retrieve the resources on the first backend, then re-apply them against the
second backend.

Review the [dynamic resources](../../reference/resources.mdx)
list to see if any other resources need to be migrated. Some common dynamic
resources includes:

- `windows_desktop`
- `apps`
- `dbs`
- `login_rule`

If you are using infrastructure-as-code tools to 
To achieve this:

1. Log in to your existing Teleport Enterprise (self-hosted) cluster and export
   a collection of the above-mentioned dynamic resource configuration using the
   `tctl` administrative tool.  An example is shown below:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=admin@example.com
   $ tctl get roles > roles.yaml 
   $ tctl get users > users.yaml 
   ```

1. Once you have the resource configuration file from the above, proceed to log
   in to your cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise tenant with an admin user and
   create the resources from the exported files:

   ```code
   # Use the --auth flag instead of --user to log in with Single Sign-On.
   $ tsh login --proxy=example.teleport.sh --user=admin@example.com
   $ tctl create -f roles.yaml
   $ tctl create -f user.yaml
   ```

For your SSO auth connector, most SSO integrations only work for a single
configured endpoint. It is recommended to create a separate SSO connector in
your Identity Provider specifically for the cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise
endpoint, and configure a new Auth Connector in the cloud-hosted Teleport
Enterprise tenant.

## Step 3/4. Migrate Teleport services and plugins

To migrate services such as Teleport agents, Machine ID Bots, and plugins, start
by cataloging the various services you're managing with Teleport. The following
resources should be considered for migration:

 - Teleport agents 
 - Machine ID Bots
 - Access Request plugins
 - The Teleport Event Handler

Before migrating services, make sure you are logged in to your new cloud-hosted
Teleport Enterprise account.

You can migrate Teleport services all at once or gradually, depending on your
business requirements. If running Teleport at scale, you'll generally want to
use a configuration management tool to automate and streamline the process of
carrying out the actions involved in migrating agent configurations. 

### Migrate Teleport agents

To migrate Teleport agents:

1. For each agent and Machine ID bot, obtain a valid join token. We recommend
   using a [delegated join
   method](../../reference/join-methods.mdx).

1. If using ephemeral tokens, ensure you specify the appropriate token type to
   match the Teleport services. Token types can include `node`, `app`, `kube`,
   `db`, `windowsdesktop` and others depending on the service you wish to join
   to your Teleport Cluster.

1. In the following example, a new token is created with the TTL of fifteen
   minutes:

   ```code
   $ tctl tokens add --type node,app,db --ttl 15m
   ```

   In this command, we assigned the token the `node`, `app` and `db` type,
   indicating that it will allow an agent to join which is running the Teleport
   `ssh_service`, `db_service` and `app_service`.

   Copy the token so you can use it later in this guide.

1. Stop Teleport services on the agent (if applicable).

1. Update the `proxy_server` or `auth_servers` field in the agent configuration
   file to point to the address of your cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise
   cluster. By default, on Linux servers, the configuration is located in the
   `/etc/teleport.yaml` directory:

   ```yaml
   version: v3
   teleport:
      proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
   ```

   If your agent configuration does *not* include a `teleport.proxy_server`
   field, and instead has a `teleport.auth_server` or `teleport.auth_servers`
   field, we recommend migrating your configuration to `version: v3` and using
   `teleport.proxy_server`. 

   With the `teleport.proxy_server` field, the agent attempts to connect to the
   Teleport cluster using a single mode, rather than multiple modes, which takes
   less time and involves less functionality to troubleshoot.

1. Update the `auth_token` or `join_params.token_name` field with the newly
   generated token.

   ```yaml
   teleport:
     join_params:
       method: token
       token_name: new-token-goes-here
   ```

1. On Linux servers, delete the local agent cache to force the agent to rejoin
   the new cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster. By default, the data is
   located in the  `/var/lib/teleport` directory:

   ```code
   rm -rf /var/lib/teleport
   ```

1. On Linux servers, restart the Teleport process on each agent or, if you are
   using the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart, recycle the Kubernetes pod to
   apply the new configuration. This will cause the agents to re-register with
   the cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster and obtain new certificates
   signed by the new cluster's certificate authority.

### Migrate Machine ID bots

In general, you can migrate a Machine ID bot using the following steps:

1. Obtain a new join token.
1. In the `tbot` configuration file, edit the `proxy_server` configuration field
   to point to the new Teleport cluster address and port `443`.
1. Restart `tbot`.

To learn how to restart and configure a Machine ID bot in your infrastructure,
read the [full documentation](../../index.mdx) on deploying a
Machine ID Bot.

### Access Request plugins and the Event Handler

In general, you can migrate Teleport plugins using the following steps:

1. If you are using Machine ID to produce credentials for the plugin,
   reconfigure the Machine ID Bot to connect to the new Teleport cluster and
   restart the Bot.

   Otherwise, connect to the new Teleport cluster with `tctl` and produce an
   identity file manually, then make it available to the plugin.

1. Reconfigure the plugin by editing the `teleport.address` field of the plugin
   configuration file to point to the address of the new Teleport cluster, with
   port `443`.

1. Restart the plugin.

For specific plugins running in your infrastructure, read the full documentation
on:
- [Access Request plugins](../access-controls/access-request-plugins/access-request-plugins.mdx)
- The [Teleport Event Handler](../management/export-audit-events/export-audit-events.mdx)

## Step 4/4. Verify end user access and performance

Once you have migrated dynamic resources and reconfigured services to connect to
your new Teleport cluster, ensure that the setup is complete.

1. Validate that all expected resources are present in the Teleport cluster and
   verify their status and connectivity to ensure they are properly registered
   and available for connections. You can either check via the Web UI, or use
   `tctl` to get a list of all resources and verify their registration and
   status. 

   For example, to list all nodes registered with the Teleport Cluster, you can run the command below:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl nodes ls
   ```
   
   Similarly, to list all other registered resources, you can run the commands below:
   
   
   List all registered Kubernetes clusters:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl kube ls
   ```
   
   List all registered databases:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl db ls
   ```
   
   List all registered applications:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl apps ls
   ```
   
   List all registered Windows desktops:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl desktop ls
   ```

1. Ensure that end users have the expected SSO access to your infrastructure.

1. Establish break-glass access procedures to ensure access to infrastructure in
   case your cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster becomes unavailable.

   For example, you can run OpenSSH with a limited key following our best
   practices on [How to SSH
   properly](https://goteleport.com/blog/how-to-ssh-properly/).
  
  We recommend configuring systemd to start OpenSSH for 5 minutes at boot, then
  shut it down. The master keys should be stored in a secure vault. To break the
  glass, obtain the master key, reboot the server, and connect using an OpenSSH
  client within 5 minutes.
