h1: Store Teleport Private Keys in Google Cloud KMS
---

This guide will show you how to set up your Teleport Cluster to use the Google
Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) to store and handle the CA private key
material used to sign all certificates issued by your Teleport cluster.

## How it works

Teleport generates private key material for its internal Certificate Authorities
(CAs) during the first Auth Service instance's initial startup.
These CAs are used to sign all certificates issued to clients and hosts in the
Teleport cluster.
When configured to use Google Cloud KMS, all private key material for these CAs
will be generated, stored, and used for signing inside of Google Cloud KMS.
Instead of the actual private key, Teleport will only store the ID of the KMS
key.
In short, private key material will never leave Google Cloud KMS.

If launching a new Teleport cluster this will all be handled during initial
startup with no specific interventions required after configuration.
For existing Teleport clusters that already have already generated software
private keys, a CA rotation must be performed.
Read on to [migrating an existing cluster](#migrating-an-existing-cluster) to
learn more.

## Prerequisites

- Teleport v(=teleport.version=) Enterprise (self-hosted).
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A Google Cloud account.

(!docs/pages/includes/enterprise/hsm-warning.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Create a key ring in GCP

Each Teleport Auth Service instance will need to be configured to use a GCP key
ring which will hold all keys generated and used by that Auth Service instance.
If running a High-Availability Teleport cluster with two or more Auth Servers,
every Auth Service instance can be configured to use the same key ring, or if
desired each can be configured to use a unique key ring in a different region
(for redundancy or to decrease latency).

It is recommended to create a dedicated key ring for use by Teleport to logically
separate it from any other keys in your cloud account.
Choose a supported
[KMS location](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/locations)
for the key ring which is geographically near to your Teleport Auth Servers.

You can create a key ring from the Google Cloud Console or from the `gcloud` CLI
tool. Follow
[this guide](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-asymmetric-keys#create_a_key_ring)
or run the following command if you have the `gcloud` CLI configured:

```code
$ gcloud kms keyrings create "<Var name="teleport-keyring" description="The name for your teleport-specific keyring"/>" --location <Var name="location" description="The GCP location for your Teleport keyring"/>
```

## Step 2/5. Create a GCP service account

Teleport needs permissions to create, list, destroy, sign with, and view KMS
keys in your key ring. Start by defining the following custom IAM role.

```yaml
# teleport_kms_role.yaml
title: teleport_kms_role
description: 'Teleport permissions for using KMS keys'
stage: ALPHA
includedPermissions:
- cloudkms.cryptoKeys.create
- cloudkms.cryptoKeys.list
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.create
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.destroy
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.useToSign
- cloudkms.cryptoKeyVersions.viewPublicKey
```

Create the role, assigning <Var name="GCP-Project-ID" /> to your Google Cloud project ID:

```code
$ gcloud iam roles create teleport_kms_role \
    --project <Var name="GCP-Project-ID" description="Your GCP project ID"/> \
    --file teleport_kms_role.yaml \
    --format yaml
```

Note the `name` field in the output which is the fully qualified name for the
custom role and must be used in later steps.

```code
$ export IAM_ROLE=<role name output from above>
```

If you don't already have a GCP service account for your Teleport Auth Service
you can create one with the following command, otherwise use your existing
service account.

```code
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create teleport-auth-server \
    --description="Service account for Teleport Auth Server" \
    --display-name="Teleport Auth Server" \
    --format=yaml
```

Note the `email` field in the output, this must be used as the identifier for
the service account.

```code
$ export SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<email output from above command>
```

Create the IAM policy binding to grant the role to the service account for this
keyring.

```code
$ gcloud kms keyrings add-iam-policy-binding <Var name="teleport-keyring"/> \
    --location <Var name="location"/> \
    --member "serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
    --role "${IAM_ROLE}"
```

<Admonition type="warning">
Be aware that anyone with access to this service account will be able to create
signatures as if they are the Teleport CA.
It should be considered highly privileged and access should be restricted as
much as possible.
</Admonition>

## Step 3/5. Provide the service account credentials to the Auth Service

The Teleport Auth Service will use Application Default Credentials to make
requests to the GCP KMS service.
Provide credentials for the `teleport-auth-server` service account created in
step 2 to the Application Default Credentials of the environment you are running
your Teleport Auth Service in.
Supported environments include GCE VMs, GKE pods, and others.

See the GCP docs for
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc)
to learn how to provide them for your preferred environment.

<Details title="Manually checking permissions">

To make sure the credentials have been configured correctly, you can run the
`gcloud` CLI tool from your Teleport Auth Service's environment. Some example
commands you could use to debug are listed here:

```code
$ gcloud kms keys list --location <Var name="location"/> --keyring "<Var name="teleport-keyring"/>"
Listed 0 items.
$ gcloud kms keys create --location <Var name="location"/> --keyring "<Var name="teleport-keyring"/>" \
    --purpose asymmetric-signing \
    --default-algorithm rsa-sign-pkcs1-4096-sha512 \
    test-key
$ gcloud kms keys list --location <Var name="location"/> --keyring "<Var name="teleport-keyring"/>"
NAME                                                                                   PURPOSE          ALGORITHM                   PROTECTION_LEVEL
projects/my-gcp-account/locations/global/keyRings/teleport-keyring/cryptoKeys/test-key ASYMMETRIC_SIGN  RSA_SIGN_PKCS1_4096_SHA512  SOFTWARE
$ echo hello > /tmp/hello.txt
$ gcloud kms asymmetric-sign --keyring "<Var name="teleport-keyring"/>" --location <Var name="location"/> \
    --key "test-key" --version 1 \
    --input-file /tmp/hello.txt --signature-file /tmp/hello.sig
$ gcloud kms keys versions destroy --keyring "<Var name="teleport-keyring"/>" --location <Var name="location"/> --key "test-key" 1
```

</Details>

## Step 4/5. Configure the Auth Service to use KMS keys

CA key parameters are statically configured in the `teleport.yaml` configuration
file of the Teleport Auth Service instances in your cluster.

Find the fully qualified name of the KMS key ring you created in
[step 1](#step-15-create-a-key-ring-in-gcp)
in the GCP Console or by running:

```code
$ gcloud kms keyrings list --location <Var name="location"/>
```

<Details title="Choosing a protection level">

Supported KMS protection levels are `SOFTWARE` and `HSM`.
If you choose `SOFTWARE`, GCP KMS will performs all cryptographic operations in
software (Teleport performs no cryptographic operations).
If you choose `HSM`, GCP KMS will perform all cryptographic operations in a
Hardware Security Module.

Both protection levels are considered secure by Google and Teleport, you should
evaluate your own organization's requirements and security policies when making
your decision.

One relevant difference is the usage quotas available to keys of each protection
level.
At the time of writing, software keys have a project-wide quota of 60k
cryptographic operations per minute, while asymmetric HSM keys have a quota of
3k operations per minute.
See the [KMS docs](https://cloud.google.com/kms/quotas) for updated numbers.
If your cluster will have many thousands of hosts or active users, the higher
quota software keys have may help to avoid any potential throttling, especially
during CA rotations where many new certificates must be signed.

</Details>

Include the following `ca_key_params` configuration in the `auth_service` section.

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
auth_service:
  # ...
  ca_key_params:
    gcp_kms:
      keyring: "projects/<your-gcp-project>/locations/<location>/keyRings/<your-teleport-keyring>"
      protection_level: "SOFTWARE"
```

If configuring this before the first start of a new Teleport cluster, the
initial CA keys will be generated in GCP and no additional steps are necessary.
If you wish to migrate an existing Teleport cluster from software keys to GCP
KMS keys, read on to
[migrating an existing cluster](#migrating-an-existing-cluster).

## Step 5/5. Make sure everything is working

After starting up your Auth Service with the `gcp_kms` configuration, you can
confirm that Teleport has generated keys in your keyring in the GCP Console or
by running:

```code
$ gcloud kms keys list --keyring "<Var name="teleport-keyring"/>" --location <Var name="location"/>
```

Try logging in to the cluster with a Teleport user to make sure that new
certificates can be signed without error.

`tctl status` should also show `GCP KMS` as the `storage` method for all
Certificate Authority keys.

## Migrating an existing cluster

If you have an existing Teleport cluster it will have already created software
CA keys during its first start.
Those existing CA keys will have been used to sign all existing user and host
certificates, and will be trusted by all other services in your cluster.

In order for the Teleport Auth Service to generate new keys in GCP KMS and have
them trusted by the rest of the cluster, you will need to rotate all of your
Teleport CAs.

`teleport start` will print a warning during startup if any CA needs to be rotated.
Any users allowed the `update` verb for `cert_authority` resources in any of
their Teleport roles will also see a cluster alert reminding them to rotate the
CAs.

CA rotation can be performed manually or semi-automatically, see our admin guide
on [Certificate rotation](../management/operations/ca-rotation.mdx).
All CAs listed in the output of `tctl status` must be rotated.
