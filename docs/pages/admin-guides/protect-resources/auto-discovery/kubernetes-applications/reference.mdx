## Configuring Teleport agent Helm chart

You can configure scope of services discovery by setting value `kubernetesDiscovery` of the chart. For more information
please see [helm chart documentation](../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx#kubernetesdiscovery).

`values.yaml` example:

```yaml
kubernetesDiscovery:
- types: ["app"]
  namespaces: [ "toronto", "porto" ]
  labels:
    env: staging
- types: ["app"]
  namespaces: [ "seattle", "oakland" ]
  labels:
    env: testing
```

## Configuring Kubernetes Apps Discovery manually

While the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart will set up configuration for you
automatically, you can also configure the required services manually. To do so,
adjust the configuration files for the Teleport Application Service and Teleport
Discovery Service, then restart the agents running these services.

Configuration for the Discovery Service is controlled by the `kubernetes` field,
example:

```yaml
# This section configures the Discovery Service
discovery_service:
  enabled: yes
  discovery_group: main-cluster
  kubernetes:
  - types: ["app"]
    namespaces: [ "toronto", "porto" ]
    labels:
      env: staging
  - types: ["app"]
    namespaces: [ "seattle", "oakland" ]
    labels:
      env: testing
```

Configuration for the Application Service is controlled by the `resources` field, example:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: yes
  resources:
  - labels:
    "teleport.dev/kubernetes-cluster": "main-cluster"
    "teleport.dev/origin": "discovery-kubernetes"
```

Label `teleport.dev/kubernetes-cluster` should match value of `discovery_group` field in the Discovery Service config.

For more information you can take a look at [`discovery_service`](../../reference/config.mdx#discovery-service) and [`app_service`](../../reference/config.mdx#application-service) configuration references.

## Annotations

Kubernetes annotations on services can be used to fine tune transformation of services to apps.
All annotations are optional - they will override default behaviour, but they are not required for import of services.

### `teleport.dev/discovery-type`

Controls what type this service is considered to be. If annotation is missing,
by default all services are considered to be of "app" type. If matchers in the Discovery Service
config match service type it will be imported. Currently the only supported value is
`app`, which means Teleport application will be imported from this service. In the future there are plans to expand to database importing.

### `teleport.dev/protocol`

Controls protocol for the uri of the Teleport app we create. If annotation is not set,
heuristics will be used to try to determine protocol of an exposed port.
If all heuristics didn't work, the port will be skipped. For app to be imported with `tcp` protocol, the
service should have explicit annotation `teleport.dev/protocol: "tcp"`

### `teleport.dev/port`

Controls preferred port for the Kubernetes service, only this one will be used even if service
has multiple exposed ports. Its value should be one of the exposed service ports; otherwise, the app will not be imported.
Value can be matched either by numeric value or by the name of the port defined on the service.

### `teleport.dev/name`

Controls resulting app name. If present it will override default app name pattern
`$SERVICE_NAME-$NAMESPACE-$KUBE_CLUSTER_NAME`. If multiple ports are exposed, resulting apps will have port names added
as a suffix to the annotation value, as `$APP_NAME-$PORT1_NAME`, `$APP_NAME-$PORT2_NAME` etc, where `$APP_NAME` is the name
set by the annotation.

### `teleport.dev/insecure-skip-verify`

Controls whether TLS certificate verification should be skipped for this app.
If present and set to `true`, TLS certificate verification will be skipped.

```yaml
annotations:
  teleport.dev/insecure-skip-verify: "true"
```

### `teleport.dev/ignore`

Controls whether this service should be ignored by the Discovery Service.
This annotation is useful when you want to exclude a service from being imported as an app
when it matches the Discovery Service config. For example, you may want to exclude a service
that shares the same labels as another services that you want to import as apps.

```yaml
annotations:
  teleport.dev/ignore: "true"
```

### `teleport.dev/app-rewrite`

Controls rewrite configuration for Teleport app, if needed. It should
contain full rewrite configuration in YAML format, same as one would use when configuring an app with dynamic registration syntax (see [documentation](../../application-access/guides/connecting-apps.mdx#rewrite-redirect)).

```yaml
annotations:
  teleport.dev/app-rewrite: |
    redirect:
    - "localhost"
    - "jenkins.internal.dev"
    headers:
    - name: "X-Custom-Header"
      value: "example"
    - name: "Authorization"
      value: "Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
```
