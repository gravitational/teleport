(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/db-introduction.mdx dbType="Microsoft SQL Server" dbConfigure="with PKINIT authentication"!)

## How it works

The Teleport Database Service joins the same Active Directory domain as the SQL
Server database and uses the Kerberos protocol to authenticate with SQL Server.
An Active Directory domain is configured to trust the Teleport certificate
authority. When a user connects to SQL Server via Teleport, the Database Service
uses [PKINIT](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/pkinit.html) to
obtain a ticket-granting ticket from Active Directory. After authenticating, the
Teleport Database Service forwards user traffic to the database.

This guide will focus on SQL Servers using self-hosted Active Directory
authentication.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A SQL Server database with Active Directory authentication enabled.

- A SQL Server network listener configured with a certificate using Subject Alternative Names.

- A Windows machine joined to the same Active Directory domain as the database.

- A Linux node with network access to an Active Directory installation and
  `kinit` command with PKINIT extensions installed:

## Step 1/7. Create a Teleport user

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/create-user.mdx!)

## Step 2/7. Configure a GPO to allow Teleport connections

We need to configure a GPO to allow Teleport database sessions. This includes
telling your computers to trust Teleport's CA and allowing certificate-based
smart card authentication.

### Export Teleport CA and CRL


<Admonition type="note" title="Database CA Rotation">
You will need to repeat these steps if you rotate Teleport's database certificate authority.
</Admonition>

1. Get the Teleport database CA certificate by running:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth export --type=db-client-der > db-ca.cer
   ```

1. Get the Teleport database CRL by running:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth crl --type=db_client > db-ca.crl
   ```

1. Transfer the `db-ca.cer` and `db-ca.crl` files to a Windows machine where you can manage your group policy.

### Create a GPO and import the Teleport CA

<Admonition type="note" title="Domain Wide Policy">
  For the purposes of this guide, we apply the GPO we are about to create to our
  entire AD domain. In the case where you wish for only a subset of computers
  within your AD domain to be accessible via Teleport, you should apply the GPO
  to an OU that includes only these computers.
</Admonition>

1. Create a GPO named `Teleport DB Access`.

   ```powershell
   $GPOName="Teleport DB Access"
   New-GPO -Name $GPOName | New-GPLink -Target $((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)
   ```

1. Open the `Group Policy Management` program, and on the left pane,
   navigate to `$FOREST > Domains > $DOMAIN > Group Policy Objects`.

1. Right click on the GPO you just made (`Teleport DB Access`), and select `Edit...`.

1. In the group policy editor, select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Public Key Policies
   ```

1. Right click on `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` and select `Import`.

1. Click through the wizard, selecting your CA file (`db-ca.cer`).

</Figure>

### Enable smart card service

Teleport performs certificate-based authentication by emulating a smart card.

1. Still editing your `Teleport DB Access`, select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > System Services
   ```

1. Double click on `Smart Card`, select `Define this policy setting` and switch
   to `Automatic` then click `OK`.

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Enable the Smart Card service">
  ![Enable Smartcard](../../../img/desktop-access/smartcard.png)
</Figure>

<Admonition type="note" title="gpupdate.exe">
  You will be modifying GPOs, and sometimes GPO modifications can take some time
  to propagate to all hosts. You can force your changes to take effect
  immediately on your current host at any time by opening a PowerShell prompt
  and running `gpupdate.exe /force` (though the effects of your changes may still take time to
  propagate to other machines on the domain).
</Admonition>

### Publish the Teleport CA

This step enables the domain controllers to trust the Teleport CA, which will
allow smart card logins via Teleport to succeed.

On a machine that is joined to your domain and logged in as an account in the
`Domain Administrators` group, run the two commands below at a PowerShell prompt
to publish the Teleport CA to your Active Directory domain (using the path
to the exported Teleport `db-ca.cer` file that you copied above):

```powershell
certutil –dspublish –f <PathToCertFile.cer> RootCA
certutil -dspublish -f <PathToCertFile.cert> NTAuthCA
```

### Publish the Teleport CRL

On the same machine, run the command below at a PowerShell prompt to publish the
Teleport CRL to your Active Directory domain (using the path to the exported
`db-ca.crl` file that you copied above).

```powershell
certutil -dspublish -f <PathToCRLFile.crl> TeleportDB
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  To avoid waiting until the certificate propagates, you can force the CA
  retrieval from LDAP after importing the CA and CRL with the command:

  ```powershell
  certutil -pulse
  ```
</Admonition>

## Step 3/7. Export the LDAP CA certificate

Teleport uses LDAPS to authenticate users, which requires specifying the LDAP CA
certificate on the database configuration. To ensure that Teleport trusts the
certificate sent by the server during the initial SSL connection, you must export
the certificate from your AD. You can export the certificate by running the
following PowerShell script on your Windows instance:

```powershell
$WindowsDERFile = $env:TEMP + "\windows.der"
$WindowsPEMFile = $env:TEMP + "\windows.pem"
certutil "-ca.cert" $WindowsDERFile 
certutil -encode $WindowsDERFile $WindowsPEMFile

$CA_CERT_PEM = Get-Content -Path $WindowsPEMFile
Write-Output $CA_CERT_PEM

Remove-Item $WindowsDERFile -Recurse
Remove-Item $WindowsPEMFile -Recurse
```

The script will write the LDAP CA contents in PEM format to the terminal, and
from there, you can copy and use it on your database configuration.

## Step 4/7. Set up the Teleport Database Service

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/token.mdx!)

Install Teleport on the host where you will run the Teleport Database Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

Copy the join token to a file on the instance where you will run the Database
Service, and then use the following configuration, replacing the fields on the
database section below as appropriate:

- `uri`: The server address, including the port.
- `domain`: The Active Directory domain (Kerberos realm) DNS/Address to which SQL Server is joined.
- `spn`: Service Principal Name (SPN) for SQL Server to fetch Kerberos tickets.
- `kdc_host_name`: SPN of the domain controller responsible for providing the LDAP CA.
- `ldap_cert`: The contents of the LDAP CA previously exported.

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  auth_token: abcd123-insecure-do-not-use-this
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443

auth_service:
  enabled: no
ssh_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no

db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
    - name: my-sqlserver
      protocol: sqlserver
      uri: SQL-SERVER-INSTANCE.ad.teleport.dev:1433
      ad:
        domain: ad.teleport.dev
        spn: MSSQLSvc/SQL-SERVER-INSTANCE.ad.teleport.dev:1433
        kdc_host_name: DOMAIN-CONTROLLER.ad.teleport.dev
        ldap_cert: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          ...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  You can look SPNs up in the Attribute Editor of the Active Directory Users and
  Computers dialog on your AD-joined Windows machine.

  If you don't see the Attribute Editor tab, make sure that the "View > Advanced Features"
  toggle is enabled.
</Admonition>

## Step 5/7. Start the Database Service

Start the Teleport Database Service in your environment:

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Database Service"!)

## Step 6/7. Create SQL Server AD users

<Admonition type="note">
  You can skip this step if you already have Active Directory logins in your
  SQL Server.
</Admonition>

Connect to your SQL Server as an administrative account (e.g. `sa`) and create
logins that will use Active Directory authentication:

```sql
master> CREATE LOGIN [EXAMPLE\alice] FROM WINDOWS WITH DEFAULT_DATABASE = [master], DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = [us_english];
```

## Step 7/7. Connect

Log in to your Teleport cluster. Your SQL Server database should appear in the
list of available databases:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=alice
$ tsh db ls
# Name      Description         Labels
# --------- ------------------- -------
# sqlserver                     env=dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=alice
$ tsh db ls
# Name      Description         Labels
# --------- ------------------- -------
# sqlserver                     env=dev
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

To retrieve credentials for a database and connect to it:

```code
$ tsh db connect --db-user=teleport sqlserver
```

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/sql-server-connect-note.mdx!)

To log out of the database and remove credentials:

```code
$ tsh db logout sqlserver
```

## Troubleshooting

### Teleport CA and CRL not imported correctly

When connecting to your database, you get an error `Error message: authentication
failed` and Teleport Database Service logs have the error message `Failed to
authenticate with KDC: kinit: Client not trusted while getting initial
credentials`. This happens when the Teleport Database CA is not imported
correctly or propagated yet. You can force the propagation by running
`certutil -pulse` and trying to connect to your database.

### Invalid KDC hostname

If you’re connecting to your database and receive the error `Error message:
authentication failed` and on Teleport Database Service logs, there is the error
entry `Failed to authenticate with KDC: Password for user@AD.TELEPORT.DEV:
\nkinit: Cannot read password while getting initial credentials`, which means
that the KDC hostname is wrong. You can verify your domain controller’s SPN to
see if they’re set correctly and update the value on the field `kdc_hostname` on
your database's configuration.

### Teleport cannot verify database CA

If your database has a CA that Teleport doesn’t know about, it will return the
following error when connecting to it: `Error message: TLS Handshake failed:
x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "x509:
invalid signature: parent certificate cannot sign this kind of certificate"
while trying to verify candidate authority certificate
"SSL_Self_Signed_Fallback")`.

To solve this, you can add the following configuration to your Teleport Database Service instance:

```diff
...
db_service:
  databases:
    - name: sqlserver
      protocol: sqlserver
+     tls:
+       # Point it to your Database CA PEM certificate.
+       ca_cert_file: "rdsca.pem"
+       # If your database certificate has an empty CN filed, you must change
+       # the TLS mode to only verify the CA.
+       mode: verify-ca
      ad:
       ...
```

If you’re unable to acquire the database CA, you can skip TLS verification by
providing the configuration `tls.mode: "insecure"`. However, we do not recommend
skipping TLS verification in production environments.
