title: MySQL Automatic User Provisioning
description: Configure automatic user provisioning for MySQL.
---

## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster v14.1 or higher with a configured [self-hosted
  MySQL](../enroll-self-hosted-databases/mysql-self-hosted.mdx) or [RDS MySQL](../enroll-aws-databases/rds.mdx)
  database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.
- Automatic user provisioning is not compatible with MySQL versions lower than
  8.0.
- Automatic user provisioning is not compatible with RDS Aurora reader
  endpoints.

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/configure-admin.mdx!)

Teleport uses the same authentication mechanism when connecting as an admin user
as for regular user connections: X.509 for self-hosted databases and AWS IAM
for RDS.

The admin user must have privileges within the database to create users and
grant them privileges. The admin user must also have privileges to monitor user
processes and role assignments.

In addition, a schema is required for the admin user to log into by default.
Stored procedures are also created and executed from this schema.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="RDS MySQL">
The RDS MySQL admin user must use `AWSAuthenticationPlugin` to allow IAM
authentication:
```sql
CREATE USER 'teleport-admin' IDENTIFIED WITH AWSAuthenticationPlugin AS 'RDS';
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.role_edges TO 'teleport-admin' ;
GRANT PROCESS, ROLE_ADMIN, CREATE USER ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `teleport`;
GRANT ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE ROUTINE, EXECUTE ON `teleport`.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Self-hosted MySQL">
The self-hosted MySQL admin user must have X.509 authentication configured:
```sql
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" REQUIRE SUBJECT "/CN=teleport-admin";
GRANT SELECT ON mysql.role_edges TO 'teleport-admin' ;
GRANT PROCESS, ROLE_ADMIN, CREATE USER ON *.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `teleport`;
GRANT ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE ROUTINE, EXECUTE ON `teleport`.* TO 'teleport-admin' ;
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Users created by Teleport will be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role in the
database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/db-definition.mdx protocol="mysql" uri="localhost:3306" !)

## Step 2/3. Configure a Teleport role

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/common-teleport-role.mdx!)

Users created within the database will:

- Be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/username-hash.mdx database="MySQL" limit="32" !)

<Details title="Tracking the name mapping">
The original Teleport username will be saved as user attributes within the
databases.

User can find its own attributes in an auto-provisioned database session by:
```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES WHERE CONCAT(USER, '@', HOST) = current_user();
```

Database admins can search a particular Teleport username by:
```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_ATTRIBUTES WHERE ATTRIBUTE->"$.user" = "teleport-user-name";
```

In addition, the "hashed" in-database name will be recorded as `db_user` for
database queries in the Teleport Audit Logs, when the Teleport username is over
32 characters.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/connect.mdx gui="MySQL Workbench"!)

## Troubleshooting

### Access denied to database error

By default, the newly created users won't have permissions to access any particular database. These permissions should be
granted through database-specific roles, such as `reader`.

Otherwise you may see errors like the following:

```shell
$ tsh db connect --db-name <database> example
ERROR 1105 (HY000): ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user '<your-teleport-username>'@'%' to database '<database>'
```

### Table is read only error

You may encounter the following error when connecting to an AWS RDS Aurora
reader endpoint:
```shell
$ tsh db connect --db-name <database> example
ERROR 3501 (HY000): The ACL operation failed due to the following error from SE: errcode 165 - Table is read only
```

Database auto-user provisioning is not compatible with RDS Aurora reader
endpoints. Please use auto-user provisioning on the primary endpoints.

### Use your mapped remote username error

## Next steps

- Connect using your [GUI database client](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).
- Learn about [role templating](../../access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx#interpolation-rules).
- Read automatic user provisioning [RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0113-automatic-database-users.md).
