title: Deploying Machine ID on Linux (TPM)
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on a Linux host and use a TPM 2.0 for authentication
---

This page explains how to deploy Machine ID on a Linux host, and use the
secure identify of the onboard TPM 2.0 chip for authenticating with the
Teleport cluster.

The `tpm` join method requires a valid Teleport Enterprise license to be
installed on the cluster's Auth Service.

## How it works

(!docs/pages/includes/tpm-joining-background.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A Linux host that you wish to install Machine ID onto, with a TPM2.0
  installed.
- A Linux user on that host that you wish Machine ID to run as. In the guide,
we will use `teleport` for this.

## Step 1/5. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the Linux host.**

First, `tbot` needs to be installed on the VM that you wish to use Machine ID
on.

Download the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Granting `tbot` access to the TPM device

If the user that will run `tbot` is not `root`, you will also need to configure
Linux to allow the user to access the TPM device.

The simplest way to solve this is to check if your distro ships with the `tss`
group and assign it the user. If that is not possible, or you are looking
for a different solution, we recommend creating udev rules similar to the ones
shipped by the [TPM2 Software Stack](
https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/ede63dd1ac1f0a46029d457304edcac2162bfab8/dist/tpm-udev.rules#L4).

## Step 2/5. Create a Bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/5. Create a `tpm` join token

With the Bot created, we now need to create a token. The token will be used by
`tbot` to authenticate as the Bot to the Teleport cluster.

### Determining the EKPub Hash or EKCert Serial for your TPM

First, you need to determine the characteristics of the TPM on the host that
you wish to use Machine ID on. These characteristics will then be used within
the allow rules of the join token to grant access to this specific host.

On the machine, run `tbot tpm identify`:

```code
$ tbot tpm identify
TPM Information
EKPub Hash: 6c5aada1c5abee6d869369a0example2fd2beb41c850d3f0227f029c4fffc4ba
EKCert Detected: true
EKCert Serial: 5e:cd:5f:8e
```

Take the long hexadecimal string after `EKPub Hash` and assign it to
<Var name="ek-public-hash" />. This uniquely identifies this TPM and will be
used in the join token.

### Obtaining the manufacturer CA

If in the previous step, `EKCert Detected` was `false`, then you can disregard
this section.

If in the previous step, `EKCert Detected` was `true`, then it is recommended
to obtain the manufacturer's CA certificate. This will allow the TPM to be
validated as legitimately manufactured as part of the join process.

Instructions for obtaining the EKCert CA will vary from TPM to TPM. Consult
your TPM's documentation for more information or contact your supplier.

### Creating the join token

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name identifies the token. Try to ensure that this is descriptive.
  name: <Var name="my-bot-token" />
spec:
  # For Machine ID and TPM joining, roles will always be "Bot" and
  # join_method will always be "tpm".
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: tpm

  # bot_name specifies the name of the bot that this token will grant access to
  # when it is used.
  bot_name: <Var name="my-bot" />

  # tpm specifies the TPM join method specific configuration for this token.
  tpm:
    # ekcert_allowed_cas is a list of CA certificates that will be used to
    # validate TPM EKCerts. These should be PEM wrapped.
    #
    # When specified, joining TPMs must present an EKCert signed by one of the
    # specified CAs. TPMs that do not present an EKCert will be not permitted to
    # join.
    ekcert_allowed_cas:
      - |
        -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
        ... CA Certificate Data ...
        -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    # allow is a list of Rules, the presented TPM must match one allow rule to
    # be permitted to join using this token.
    allow:
        # description is a human-readable description of the rule. It has no
        # bearing on whether a TPM is allowed to join, but can be used to
        # associate a rule with a specific host (e.g the asset tag of the server
        # in which the TPM resides).
      - description: "example-server-100"
        # ek_public_hash is the SHA256 hash of the EKPub marshaled in PKIX format
        # and encoded in hexadecimal. This value will also be checked when a TPM
        # has submitted an EKCert, and the public key in the EKCert will be used
        # for this check.
        ek_public_hash: "<Var name="ek-public-hash" />"
```

If your TPM includes an EKCert and you have obtained the manufacturer's CA,
replace the `ekcert_allowed_cas` section with the PEM wrapped CA certificate.
Otherwise, remove this section.

If you have multiple hosts that you wish to authenticate as the same Bot, you
can add additional rules the `allow` list, one for each host.

Apply this to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 4/5. Configure `tbot`

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: tpm
  token: <Var name="my-bot-token" />
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy.

### Prepare the storage directory

The `tbot` service requires a way to store its state, such as internal
credentials, across restarts. This is known as the storage destination.

For this example, we will use the directory `/var/lib/teleport/bot`.

As this directory will store the bots sensitive credentials, it is important
to protect it. To do this, you will configure the directory to only be
accessible to the Linux user which `tbot` will run as.

Execute the following, replacing `teleport` with the Linux user that you will
run `tbot` as:

```code
# Make the bot directory and assign ownership to teleport user
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/teleport/bot
$ sudo chown teleport:teleport /var/lib/teleport/bot
```

### Create a systemd service
