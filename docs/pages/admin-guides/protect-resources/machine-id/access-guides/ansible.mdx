title: Machine ID with Ansible
description: How to use Machine ID with Ansible
---

Ansible is a common tool for managing fleets of Linux hosts via SSH. In order to
connect to the hosts, it requires a form of authentication. Machine ID can be
used to provide short-lived certificates to Ansible that allow it to connect
to SSH nodes enrolled in Teleport in a secure and auditable manner.

In this guide, you will configure the Machine ID agent, `tbot`, to produce
credentials and an OpenSSH configuration, and then configure Ansible to use
these to connect to your SSH nodes through the Teleport Proxy Service.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools to use Teleport with Ansible.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- `ssh` OpenSSH tool

- `ansible` >= (=ansible.min_version=)

- Optional: [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to process `JSON` output

- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the machine that will
  run Ansible. For more information, see the
  [deployment guides](../deployment.mdx).

- If you followed the above guide, note the `--destination-dir=/opt/machine-id`
  flag, which defines the directory where SSH certificates and OpenSSH configuration
  used by Ansible will be written.

  In particular, you will be using the `/opt/machine-id/ssh_config` file in your
  Ansible configuration to define how Ansible should connect to Teleport Nodes.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Configure RBAC

As Ansible will use the credentials produced by `tbot` to connect to the SSH
nodes, you first need to configure Teleport to grant the bot access. This is
done by creating a role that grants the necessary permissions and then assigning
this role to a Bot.

In this example, access will be granted to all SSH nodes for the username
<Var name="root" />. Ensure that you set this to a username that is available
across your SSH nodes and that will have the appropriate privileges to manage
your nodes.

Create a file called `role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    # Allow login to the user 'root'.
    logins: ['<Var name="root" />']
    # Allow connection to any node. Adjust these labels to match only nodes
    # that Ansible needs to access.
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Replace `example-role` with a descriptive name related to your use case.

For production use, you should use labels to restrict this access to only the
hosts that Ansible will need to access. This is known as the principal of
least privilege and reduces damage that exfiltrated credentials can do.

Use `tctl create -f ./role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and `example-role`
with the name of the role you just created:

```bash
$ tctl bots update example --add-roles example-role
```

## Step 2/4. Configure the `tbot` output

Now, `tbot` needs to be configured with an output that will produce the
credentials and SSH configuration that is needed by Ansible. For SSH,
we use the `identity` output type.

Outputs must be configured with a destination. In this example, the `directory`
destination will be used. This will write these credentials to a specified
directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can be written to by the Linux
user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by the Linux user that Ansible
will run as.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to execute the Ansible
playbook.

You should now see several files under `/opt/machine-id`:

- `ssh_config`: this can be used with Ansible or OpenSSH to configure them to
use the Teleport Proxy Service with the correct credentials when making connections.
- `known_hosts`: this contains the Teleport SSH host CAs and allows the SSH
client to validate a host's certificate.
- `key-cert.pub`: this is an SSH certificate signed by the Teleport SSH user
CA.
- `key`: this is the private key needed to use the SSH certificate.

Next, Ansible will be configured to use these files when making connections.

## Step 3/4. Configure Ansible

Create a folder named `ansible` where all Ansible files will be collected.

```code
$ mkdir -p ansible
$ cd ansible
```

Create a file called `ansible.cfg`. We will configure Ansible
to run the OpenSSH client with the configuration file generated
by Machine ID, `/opt/machine-id/ssh_config`. Note, `example.com` here is the
name of your Teleport cluster.

```code
[defaults]
host_key_checking = True
inventory=./hosts
remote_tmp=/tmp

[ssh_connection]
scp_if_ssh = True
ssh_args = -F /opt/machine-id/ssh_config
```

You can then create an inventory file called `hosts`. This should refer to the
hosts using their hostname as registered in Teleport and the name of your
Teleport cluster should be appended to this. For example, if your cluster is
called `teleport.example.com` and your host is called `node1`, the entry in
`hosts` would be `node1.teleport.example.com`.

You can generate an inventory file for all your nodes that meets this
requirement with a script like the following:

```code
# Source tsh env to get the name of the current Teleport cluster.
$ eval "$( tsh env )"
# You can modify the `tsh ls` command to filter nodes based ont he label.
$ tsh ls --format=json | jq --arg cluster $TELEPORT_CLUSTER -r '.[].spec.hostname + "." + $cluster' > hosts
```

</Details>

## Step 4/4. Run a playbook

Finally, let's create a simple Ansible playbook, `playbook.yaml`. The example
playbook below runs `hostname` on all hosts.

```yaml
- hosts: all
  remote_user: <Var name="root" />
  tasks:
    - name: "hostname"
      command: "hostname"
```

From the folder `ansible`, run the Ansible playbook:

```code
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yaml

# PLAY [all] *****************************************************************************************************************************************
# TASK [Gathering Facts] *****************************************************************************************************************************
#
# ok: [terminal]
#
# TASK [hostname] ************************************************************************************************************************************
# changed: [terminal]
#
# PLAY RECAP *****************************************************************************************************************************************
# terminal                   : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

You are all set. You have provided your machine with short-lived certificates
tied to a machine identity that can be rotated, audited, and controlled with
all the familiar Teleport access controls.

## Troubleshooting

In case if Ansible cannot connect, you may see error like this one:

```txt
example.host | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh: ssh: Could not resolve hostname node-name: Name or service not known",
    "unreachable": true
}
```

You can examine and tweak patterns matching the inventory hosts in `ssh_config`.

Try the SSH connection using `ssh_config` with verbose mode to inspect the error:

```code
$ ssh -vvv -F /opt/machine-id/ssh_config <Var name="root" />@node-name.example.com
```

If `ssh` works, try running the playbook with verbose mode on:

```code
$ ansible-playbook -vvv playbook.yaml
```
