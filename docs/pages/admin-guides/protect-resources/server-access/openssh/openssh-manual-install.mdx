title: Using Teleport with OpenSSH in agentless mode (manual installation)
description: This guide shows you how to set up Teleport to enable secure access to OpenSSH servers so you can protect legacy systems that do not run a Teleport binary.

---

In this guide, we will show you how to configure the OpenSSH server `sshd` to
join a Teleport cluster. Existing fleets of OpenSSH servers can be configured to
accept SSH certificates dynamically issued by a Teleport CA.

Using Teleport and OpenSSH has the advantage of getting you up
and running, but in the long run, we would recommend replacing `sshd` with `teleport`.
`teleport` SSH servers have support for multiple features that are incompatible with OpenSSH:

- RBAC and resource filtering based on [dynamically updated labels](../../management/admin/labels.mdx)
- [Session recording without SSH connection termination](../guides/recording-proxy-mode.mdx)
- [Session sharing](../../connect-your-client/tsh.mdx)
- [Advanced session recording](../guides/bpf-session-recording.mdx)

Teleport supports OpenSSH by proxying SSH connections through the Proxy Service. When a Teleport user requests to connect to an OpenSSH node, the Proxy Service checks the user's Teleport roles.

If the RBAC checks succeed, the Proxy Service authenticates to the OpenSSH node with a dynamically generated certificate signed by a Teleport CA. This allows the
Proxy Service to record and audit connections to OpenSSH nodes.

The Proxy Service prevents Teleport users from bypassing auditing by requiring
a certificate signed by a Teleport CA that only the Auth Service possesses.

In this setup, the Teleport SSH Service performs RBAC checks as well as audits and records sessions on its host, which eliminates the need for connection termination when recording SSH sessions.

  This guide shows you how to register an OpenSSH node by creating a node resource
  and configuring OpenSSH to trust the Teleport CA. If you can copy the
  `teleport` binary onto your OpenSSH node and execute it however, you can follow
  the [standard registration guide](openssh.mdx) instead, which has fewer steps.
  Teleport is able to perform many of the steps we show in this guide automatically.

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- OpenSSH version 6.9 or above on your local machine. View your OpenSSH version
  with the command:

  ```code
  $ ssh -V
  ```

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux host with the OpenSSH server `sshd` version 7.4 or above installed,
  but not Teleport. The SSH port on this host must be open to traffic from the
  Teleport Proxy Service host.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

### Upgrading to v14 from legacy OpenSSH nodes

  If you have previously configured OpenSSH nodes to trust a Teleport CA without
  registering them and you upgrade your Teleport cluster to Teleport 14, you won't
  be able to connect to them anymore by default. This is because open dialing to
  OpenSSH servers not registered with the cluster is no longer allowed in Teleport 14.
  To ensure that you will retain access to your OpenSSH nodes you will need to follow
  this guide to register every OpenSSH node with Teleport that you previously
  configured. This must be done *before* your Teleport cluster is upgraded to Teleport 14.

  If you are having issues registering OpenSSH nodes or need to upgrade your
  Teleport cluster to Teleport 14 before registering all of your OpenSSH nodes, you can 
  pass the `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_UNLISTED_AGENT_DIALING` environment variable to your
  Proxy Service and set it to `yes`. This will allow connections to unregistered
  OpenSSH nodes but will be removed in Teleport v15.


## Step 1/5. Add a node resource to your Teleport cluster

When you request an SSH connection to a OpenSSH node, Teleport needs to be able
to find the node's IP address so it can establish a connection to it.

Declare a `node` resource so Teleport knows how to reach your OpenSSH server.
On your local machine, create a file called `openssh-node-resource.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: node
version: v2
sub_kind: openssh
metadata:
  name: a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a
  labels:
    env: prod
spec:
  addr: 1.2.3.4:22
  hostname: openssh-node
```

`spec.addr` and `spec.hostname` are mandatory. Assign `spec.addr` to the address and port of your node
and `spec.hostname` to the name of the node as you would like users to see it in Teleport.

The `metadata.labels` field labels the SSH Service instance so you can apply RBAC rules to it.

The `metadata.name` field isn't mandatory, but setting it here will save you some work later.

To generate a new universal unique identifier (UUID) suitable for a `node` name, use the `uuidgen`
on Linux or MacOS, or use the `New-Guid` cmdlet in Powershell on Windows.

Create the node resource:

```code
$ tctl create openssh-node-resource.yaml
```

<Admonition type="note">
  This step can be done with Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools (tctl,
  Terraform, or Kubernetes Operator). This is described [in the OpenSSH server
  IaC guide](../../management/dynamic-resources/agentless-ssh-servers.mdx).
</Admonition>

## Step 2/5. Configure `sshd` to trust the Teleport CA

Later in this guide, we will generate an SSH client configuration that will use
a certificate signed by the Teleport Auth Service to authenticate to your SSH
server. For this to work, `sshd` must be told to allow users to log in with
certificates generated by the Teleport Auth Service.

Start by exporting the Teleport CA public key.

On the host where you are running `sshd`, run the following commands, assigning <Var name="proxy" /> to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```code
$ export KEY=$(curl 'https://<Var name="proxy"/>/webapi/auth/export?type=openssh' | sed "s/cert-authority\ //")
```

Make the public key accessible to `sshd`:

```code
$ sudo bash -c "echo \"$KEY\" > /etc/ssh/teleport_openssh_ca.pub"
$ sudo bash -c "echo 'TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/teleport_openssh_ca.pub' >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config"
```

Restart `sshd`. For systemd-enabled hosts, run the following command:

```code
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Now, `sshd` will trust users who present a Teleport-issued certificate.

## Step 3/5. Configure host authentication

Next, ask Teleport to issue a valid host certificate for your `sshd` host. Later
in this guide, we will configure your SSH client to trust the certificate,
authenticating your `sshd` host for your SSH client. Like the user certificate
we created earlier, the host certificate will be signed by the Teleport Auth
Service.

### Ensure that your user has the correct privileges

Your user must be authorized to read and write host certificates.

On your local machine, create a file called `host-certifier.yaml` with the
following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: host-certifier
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources:
          - host_cert
        verbs:
          - list
          - create
          - read
          - update
          - delete
```

Create the role resource:

```code
$ tctl create host-certifier.yaml
# role 'host-certifier' has been created
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="host-certifier"!)

You will now have the required permissions to export a host key for your `sshd`
host.

### Issue a host certificate

<Details title="Find your node's UUID">

When you created a `node` resource and if you didn't set the `metadata.name` field earlier,
the Teleport Auth Service generated a universal unique identifier (UUID) for that node.
Teleport Proxy Services uses the UUID to differentiate nodes with the same hostname, so
it must be added to the host certificate. To find your node's UUID, first determine if its hostname is unique:

```code
$ tctl get node/openssh-node --format text
```

If only one node is displayed and you have `jq` installed, you can run the
following command to get your node's UUID:

```code
$ tctl get node/openssh-node --format=json | jq -r ".[0].metadata.name"
```

Otherwise, find your node's UUID in the `metadata.name` field of the YAML
output of this command:

```code
$ tctl get node/openssh-node
```

</Details>

#### Create the host certificate

When creating host certificates, it is important to specify all the domain names
and addresses that refer to your node. If you try to connect to a node with a
name or address that was not specified when creating it's host certificate,
Teleport will reject the SSH connection.

On your local machine, assign the IP address, fully qualified domain name of
your node, and the node's UUID to an environment variable. If you won't be
connecting to your node with its hostname, you can safely omit it.

```code
$ ADDR=1.2.3.4,openssh-node,a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a
```

Run the following `tctl` command to generate a host certificate:

```code
$ tctl auth sign \
      --host=${ADDR?} \
      --format=openssh \
      --out=myhost

# The credentials have been written to myhost, myhost-cert.pub
```

The above command will result in a private key and certificate.

<Details title="Issuing certificates for multiple hosts">

To generate certificates for multiple hosts, assign the `host` flag to a
comma-separated list of addresses. Certificates for wildcard domains are not
supported by OpenSSH, so each domain must be fully qualified.

</Details>

Use `ssh-keygen` to verify the contents of the certificate:

```code
$ ssh-keygen -L -f myhost-cert.pub
```

The `Principals` section should contain the address you assigned to `ADDR`
earlier:

```
myhost-cert.pub:
        Type: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com host certificate
        Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:nHkp6SnrAW4AV00VUaqPgR6SgdyvV9MmjUrYnwZ779A
        Signing CA: RSA SHA256:euqx2Y8Pq+r0c94GKVNXAklBVTmAJtaQUn3/ehrfEJE (using rsa-sha2-512)
        Key ID: ""
        Serial: 0
        Valid: after 2022-04-22T11:14:16
        Principals:
                1.2.3.4
                openssh-node
                a100fdd0-52db-4eca-a7ab-c3afa7a1564a
        Critical Options: (none)
        Extensions:
                x-teleport-authority UNKNOWN OPTION (len 33)
                x-teleport-role UNKNOWN OPTION (len 8)
```

Copy the host key and certificate to your `sshd` host, placing them in the
directory `/etc/ssh`.

Make sure these files have the correct permissions:

```code
$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/myhost
$ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/myhost-cert.pub
```

Then add the following lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on your `sshd` host:

```yaml
HostKey /etc/ssh/myhost
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/myhost-cert.pub
```

Restart `sshd`.

## Step 4/5. Generate an SSH client configuration

The next step is to configure your OpenSSH client to connect to your `sshd` host
using credentials managed by Teleport. This configuration will use your user's
Teleport-issued certificate to authenticate to the `sshd` host. It will also
authenticate the `sshd` host using the host certificate you generated earlier.

First, make sure you have logged in to your Teleport cluster:

On your local machine, run the following `tsh` command. This will print a
configuration block that tells your SSH client to use credentials managed by
Teleport to connect to hosts in your cluster.

```code
$ tsh config > ssh_config_teleport
```

This command creates an SSH configuration file at a nonstandard location in
order to make it easier to clean up, but you can append the output of
`tsh config` to the default SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`) if you wish.

<Details title="How does the config work?">

Teleport implements an SSH server that includes several **subsystems**, or
predefined commands that are run when the server handles a connection. The Proxy
Service implements a `proxy` subsystem that forwards SSH traffic to remote hosts
and trusted clusters.

Here is a brief explanation of the configuration that `tsh config` generates:

```
# Common flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts
Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} {{ .ProxyHost }}
    UserKnownHostsFile "{{ .KnownHostsPath }}"
    IdentityFile "{{ .IdentityFilePath }}"
    CertificateFile "{{ .CertificateFilePath }}"
```

If the host you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster (i.e., its
address is a subdomain of your cluster's domain), use a Teleport-managed known
hosts file, private key, and certificate that are stored in the `.tsh`
directory.

```
# Flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts except the proxy
Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} !{{ .ProxyHost }}
    Port 3022
    ProxyCommand "{{ .TSHPath }}" proxy ssh --cluster={{ .ClusterName }} --proxy={{ .ProxyHost }} %r@%h:%p
```

If the host that you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster, the
OpenSSH client will first execute a command, the `ProxyCommand`, that
establishes an SSH connection to the Proxy Service. This command,
`tsh proxy ssh`, requests the `proxy` subsystem in order to forward SSH traffic
through the Proxy Service to your chosen host (including a host in a Trusted
Cluster).

The `tsh proxy ssh` command requests the `proxy` subsystem through a command
similar to the following, which assumes you are logging in to a node called
`mynode` as `root` with a cluster called `teleport.example.com`:

```code
$ /usr/bin/ssh -l root -A -o UserKnownHostsFile=/root/.tsh/known_hosts -p 11105 teleport.example.com -s proxy:mynode:3022@teleport.example.com
```

Notice that the `known_hosts` file used by the command is managed by `tsh`.
Since the `sshd` host's information is listed in this file, your SSH client can
authenticate the host via the certificate we generated earlier.

</Details>

<Details title="Using PowerShell on Windows?">

  If using PowerShell on Windows, note that normal shell redirection may write
  the file with the incorrect encoding. To ensure it's written properly, try the
  following:

  ```code
  $ tsh.exe config | out-file .ssh\config -encoding utf8 -append
  ```

</Details>

<Details title="Dialing uppercase hostnames with OpenSSH">
Routing in Teleport clusters is case-sensitive by default, but OpenSSH always lowercases hostnames. If you
are using an OpenSSH client and have hosts with uppercase letters in their hostnames, you may need to set
`case_insensitive_routing: true` in either the `auth_service` block of your Teleport config, or in the
`cluster_networking_config` resource.
</Details>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Multiple Clusters"
>

  If you switch between multiple Teleport Proxy Servers, you'll need to re-run
  `tsh config` for each to generate the cluster-specific configuration.

  Similarly, if trusted clusters are added or removed, be sure to re-run
  `tsh config` and replace the previous configuration.

</Admonition>

## Step 5/5. Connect to your `sshd` host

Once you have appended the new text to your OpenSSH client configuration file,
you can log in to your `sshd` host using the configuration we generated earlier.

First, define environment variables for the address of your Teleport cluster,
the username you will use to log in to your `sshd` host, and the port on your
`sshd` host you are using for SSH traffic:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss"]} label="Teleport Community Edition/Enterprise">

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=teleport.example.com
$ PORT=22
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=mytenant.teleport.sh
$ PORT=22
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, SSH in to your remote host:

```code
$ ADDR_NODE=openssh-node
$ ssh -p ${PORT?} -F ssh_config_teleport "${USER?}@${ADDR_NODE?}.${CLUSTER?}"
```

This name does not need to be resolvable via DNS as the connection will be
routed through your Teleport Proxy Service.

<Details title="Why are we overriding the port here?">

By default, the OpenSSH client configuration generated by `tsh config` directs
the Teleport Proxy Service to dial port 3022 of a node in your Teleport cluster.
This works if the node's SSH Service is listening on port 3022, and means that
you can connect to the Teleport SSH Service via your OpenSSH client.

 When you join a Teleport node to a cluster, the node creates a reverse tunnel
 to the cluster's Proxy Service. When you run an `ssh` command to access a host
 in your Teleport cluster using the configuration we generated, the Teleport
 Proxy Service will attempt to connect to the host via this reverse tunnel and,
 if that fails, try directly dialing the address.

In our case, the `sshd` host is not running Teleport, so no reverse tunnel will
exist. Instead, the Proxy Service will establish a direct connection on the
host's SSH port.

</Details>

<Details title="Using trusted clusters?">

You can log in to a host in a trusted leaf cluster by placing the name of the cluster
between the name of the node and the name of your root cluster:

```code
$ ssh -F ssh_config_teleport ${USER?}@node2.leafcluster.${CLUSTER}
```

</Details>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Note"
>

  Teleport uses OpenSSH certificates instead of keys. When you connect to a
  remote host, OpenSSH verifies that the address of the host is listed under the
  `Principals` section of the OpenSSH certificate. Usually, this is a fully
  qualified domain name, rather than an IP address.
