description: Troubleshooting and Collecting Metrics of Teleport Processes
---

In this guide, we will explain how to address issues or unexpected behavior in your
Teleport cluster.

You can use these steps to get more visibility into the `teleport` process so
you can troubleshoot the Auth Service, Proxy Service, and Teleport agent
services such as the Application Service and Database Service.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Enable verbose logging

To change log levels in Teleport, you can use either of the following methods:

- Debug Service: Allows on-the-fly log level adjustments without restarting the
  instance, which is ideal for troubleshooting sessions.
- Updating configuration: Involves updating the Teleport configuration file and
  restarting the instance.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Debug Service">
The Teleport Debug Service allows administrators to dynamically manage log levels
without restarting the instance. The service, enabled by default, ensures
local-only access and must be consumed from inside the same instance.

To change the instance log level use the `teleport debug set-log-level` command:

```code
$ teleport debug set-log-level DEBUG
Changed log level from "INFO" to "DEBUG".

$ kubectl -n teleport exec my-pod -- teleport set-log-level DEBUG 
Changed log level from "INFO" to "DEBUG".
```

If you're unsure what is the current level you can retrieve it using
`teleport debug get-log-level`.

After troubleshooting, remember to turn the log level back to avoid generating
unnecessary logs.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Updating configuration">
To diagnose problems, you can configure the `teleport` process to run with
verbose logging enabled by passing it the `-d` flag. `teleport` will write logs
to stderr.

Alternatively, you can set the log level from the Teleport configuration file:

```yaml
teleport:
  log:
    severity: DEBUG
```

Restart the `teleport` process to apply the modified log level. Logs will resemble
the following (these logs were printed while joining a server to a cluster, then
terminating the `teleport` process on the server):

</Tabs>

Debug logs include the file and line number of the code that emitted the log, so
you can investigate (or report) what a `teleport` process was doing before it ran into
problems. Here's an example:

```
DEBU [NODE:PROX] Agent connected to proxy: [aee1241f-0f6f-460e-8149-23c38709e46d.tele.example.com aee1241f-0f6f-460e-8149-23c38709e46d teleport-proxy-us-west-2-6db8db844c-ftmg9.tele.example.com teleport-proxy-us-west-2-6db8db844c-ftmg9 localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 tele.example.com 100.92.90.42 remote.kube.proxy.teleport.cluster.local]. leaseID:4 target:tele.example.com:11106 reversetunnel/agent.go:414

DEBU [NODE:PROX] Pool is closing agent. leaseID:3 target:tele.example.com:11106 reversetunnel/agentpool.go:238
```

<Notice

  It is not recommended to run Teleport in production with verbose logging as it
  generates a substantial amount of data.

</Notice>

## Step 2/3. Generate a debug dump

The `teleport` binary is a Go program. Go programs assign work to CPU threads
using an abstraction called a **goroutine**. You can get a goroutine dump of a
running `teleport` process by sending it a `USR1` signal.

This is especially useful for troubleshooting a `teleport` process that appears
stuck, since you can see which a goroutine is blocked and and why. For example,
goroutines often communicate using **channels**, and a goroutine dump indicates
whether a goroutine is waiting to send or receive on a channel.

To generate a goroutine dump, send a `USR1` signal to a `teleport` process:

```code
$ kill -USR1 $(pidof teleport)
```

Teleport will print the debug information to `stderr`. Here what you will see in
the logs:

```txt
INFO [PROC:1]    Got signal "user defined signal 1", logging diagnostic info to stderr. service/signals.go:99
Runtime stats
goroutines: 64
OS threads: 10
GOMAXPROCS: 2
num CPU: 2
...
goroutines: 84
...
Goroutines
goroutine 1 [running]:
runtime/pprof.writeGoroutineStacks(0x3c2ffc0, 0xc0001a8010, 0xc001011a38, 0x4bcfb3)
	/usr/local/go/src/runtime/pprof/pprof.go:693 +0x9f
...
```

<Notice type="tip">

You can print a goroutine dump without enabling verbose logging.

## Step 3/3. Ask for help

Once you have collected verbose logs and a goroutine dump from your `teleport`
binary, you can use this information to get help from the Teleport community and
Support team.

### Collect your Teleport version

Determine the version of the `teleport` process you are investigating.

```code
$ teleport version
Teleport v8.3.7 git:v8.3.7-0-ga8d066935 go1.17.3
```

You can also collect the versions of the Teleport Auth Service, Proxy
Service, and client tools to rule out version compatibility issues.

To see the version of the Auth Service and Proxy Service, run the following
command:

```code
$ tctl status
Cluster  mytenant.teleport.sh
Version  (=cloud.version=)
Host CA  never updated
User CA  never updated
Jwt CA   never updated
CA pin   (=presets.ca_pin=)
```

Get the versions of your client tools:

```code
$ tctl version
Teleport v9.0.4 git: go1.18
$ tsh version
Teleport v9.0.4 git: go1.18
```

## Common Issues

### `teleport.cluster.local`

It is common to see references to `teleport.cluster.local` within logs and
errors in Teleport. This is a special value that is used within Teleport for two
purposes and seeing it within your logs is not necessarily an indication that
anything is incorrect.

Firstly, Teleport uses this value within certificates (as a DNS Subject
Alternative Name) issued to the Auth and Proxy Service. Teleport clients can
then use this value to validate the service's certificates during the TLS
handshake regardless of the service address as long as the client already has a
copy of the cluster's certificate authorities. This is important as there are
often multiple different ways that a client can connect to the Auth Service and
these are not always via the same address.

Secondly, this value is used by clients as part of the URL when making gRPC or
HTTP requests to the Teleport API. This is because the Teleport API client uses
special logic to open the connection to the Auth Service to make the request,
rather than connecting to a single address as a typical client may do. This
special logic is necessary for the client to be able to support connecting to a
list of Auth Services or to be able to connect to the Auth Service through a
tunnel via the Proxy Service. This means that `teleport.cluster.local` appears
in log messages that show the URL of a request made to the Auth Service, and
does not explicitly indicate that something is misconfigured.
