title: Running Teleport on IBM Cloud
description: How to install and configure Gravitational Teleport on IBM cloud for SSH and Kubernetes access.
---

We've created this guide to give customers an overview of how to use Teleport on
[IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud). This guide provides a high-level
introduction to setting up and running Teleport in production.

We have split this guide into:

- [Teleport on IBM FAQ](#teleport-on-ibm-cloud-faq)
- [IBM Teleport Introduction](#ibm-teleport-introduction)

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Teleport on IBM Cloud FAQ

### Why would you want to use Teleport with IBM Cloud?

Teleport provides privileged access management for cloud-native infrastructure that
doesnâ€™t get in the way. Infosec and systems engineers can secure access to their
infrastructure, meet compliance requirements, reduce operational overhead, and have
complete visibility into access and behavior.

By using Teleport with IBM you can easily unify all access for both IBM Cloud and
Softlayer infrastructure.

### Which Services can I use Teleport with?

You can use Teleport for all the services that you would SSH into. This guide is
focused on IBM Cloud. 

We plan on expanding our guide to eventually include using Teleport with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.

## IBM Teleport Introduction

This guide will cover how to set up, configure and run Teleport on IBM Cloud.

IBM Services required to run Teleport in High Availability:

- [IBM Cloud: Virtual Servers with Instance Groups](#ibm-cloud-virtual-servers-with-instance-groups)
- [Storage: Database for etcd](#storage-database-for-etcd)
- [Storage: IBM Cloud Object Storage](#storage-ibm-cloud-object-storage)
- [Network Services: Cloud DNS](#network-ibm-cloud-dns-services)

Other things needed:

- [SSL Certificate](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/ssl-certificates)

We recommend setting up Teleport in High Availability mode (HA). In High Availability mode [etcd](https://etcd.io/)
stores the state of the system and [IBM Cloud Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/storage)
stores the audit logs.

### IBM Cloud: Virtual Servers with Instance Groups

We recommend Gen 2 Cloud IBM [Virtual Servers](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/virtual-servers) and [Auto Scaling](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-faqs-auto-scale)

- For Staging and POCs we recommend using `bx2-2x8` machines with 2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM, 4 Gbps.
- For Production we would recommend `cx2-4x8` with 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, 8 Gbps.

### Storage: Database for etcd

IBM offers [managed etcd](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/databases-for-etcd) instances.
Teleport uses etcd as a scalable database to maintain High Availability and provide 
graceful restarts. The service has to be turned on from within the [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/databases-for-etcd).

We recommend picking an etcd instance in the same region as your planned Teleport
cluster.

- Deployment region: Same as rest of Teleport Cluster
- Initial Memory allocation: 2GB/member (6GB total)
- Initial disk allocation: 20GB/member (60GB total)
- CPU allocation: Shared
- etcd version: 3.3

#### Saving Credentials

![Creating IBM Server](../../../img/IBM/etcd-pass.png)
![etcd cert and host](../../../img/IBM/etcd-cert-and-host.png)

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
    type: etcd
    # list of etcd peers to connect to:
    # Showing IBM example host and port.
    peers: ["https://a9e977c0-224a-40bb-af51-21893b8fde79.b2b5a92ee2df47d58bad0fa448c15585.databases.appdomain.cloud:30359"]
    # optional password based authentication
    # See https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/authentication/ for setting
    # up a new user. IBM Defaults to `root`
    username: 'root'
    # The password file should just contain the password.
    password_file: '/var/lib/etcd-pass'
    # TLS certificate Name, with file contents from Overview
    tls_ca_file: '/var/lib/teleport/797cfsdf23e-4027-11e9-a020-42025ffb08c8.pem'
    # etcd key (location) where teleport will be storing its state under.
    # make sure it ends with a '/'!
    prefix: '/teleport/'
```

### Storage: IBM Cloud Object Storage

We recommend using [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage) to store Teleport recorded sessions.

- Create New Object Storage Resource. [IBM Catalog - Object Storage Quick Link](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/object-storage)
- Create a new bucket.
- Set up [HMAC Credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-uhc-hmac-credentials-main)
- Update audit sessions URI: `audit_sessions_uri: 's3://BUCKET-NAME/readonly/records?endpoint=s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud&region=ibm'`

When setting up `audit_sessions_uri` use `s3://` session prefix.

The credentials are used from `~/.aws/credentials` and should be created with HMAC option:

![Creating Service Creds](../../../img/IBM/cloud.ibm.com_object-store-service-creds.png)

```json
{
  "apikey": "LU9VCDf4dDzj1wjt0Q-BHaa2VEM7I53_3lPff50d_uv3",
  "cos_hmac_keys": {
    "access_key_id": "e668d66374e141668ef0089f43bc879e",
    "secret_access_key": "d8762b57f61d5dd524ccd49c7d44861ceab098d217d05836"
  },
  "endpoints": "https://control.cloud-object-storage.cloud.ibm.com/v2/endpoints",
  "iam_apikey_description": "Auto-generated for key e668d663-74e1-4166-8ef0-089f43bc879e",
  "iam_apikey_name": "Service credentials-1",
  "iam_role_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Writer",
  "iam_serviceid_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam-identity::a/0328d127d04047548c9d4bedcd24b85e::serviceid:ServiceId-c7ee0ee9-ea74-467f-a49e-ef60f6b27a71",
  "resource_instance_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/0328d127d04047548c9d4bedcd24b85e:32049c3c-207e-4731-8b8a-53bf3b4844e7::"
}
```

Save these settings to `~/.aws/credentials`

```yaml
# Example keys from example service account to be saved into ~/.aws/credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id="(=aws.aws_access_key=)"
aws_secret_access_key="(=aws.aws_secret_access_key=)"
```

Example `/etc/teleport.yaml`

```yaml
...
storage:
    ...
    # Note
    #
    # endpoint=s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud | This URL will
    # differ depending on which region the bucket is created. Use the  public
    # endpoints.
    #
    # region=ibm | Should always be set as IBM.
    audit_sessions_uri: 's3://BUCKETNAME/readonly/records?endpoint=s3.us-east.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud&region=ibm'
    ...
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  When starting with `teleport start --config=/etc/teleport.yaml -d` you can confirm that the
  bucket has been created.
</Admonition>

```code
$ sudo teleport start --config=/etc/teleport.yaml -d
# DEBU [SQLITE]    Connected to: file:/var/lib/teleport/proc/sqlite.db?_busy_timeout=10000&_sync=OFF, poll stream period: 1s lite/lite.go:173

# DEBU [KEYGEN]    SSH cert authority is going to pre-compute 25 keys. native/native.go:104

# INFO [S3]        Setup bucket "ben-teleport-test-cos-standard-b98" completed. duration:356.958618ms s3sessions/s3handler.go:147
```

### Network: IBM Cloud DNS Services

We recommend using [IBM Cloud DNS](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/dns-services) for
the Teleport Proxy public address.

```yaml
    # The DNS name the proxy HTTPS endpoint as accessible by cluster users.
    # Defaults to the proxy's hostname if not specified. If running multiple
    # proxies behind a load balancer, this name must point to the load balancer
    # (see public_addr section below)
    public_addr: proxy.example.com:3080
```
