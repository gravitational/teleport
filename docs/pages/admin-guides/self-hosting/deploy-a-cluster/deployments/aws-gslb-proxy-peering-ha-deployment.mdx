title: "AWS Multi-Region Proxy Deployment"
description: "Deploying a high-availability Teleport cluster using Proxy Peering and Route 53 to create global server load balancing."
---

This deployment architecture features two important design decisions:

- AWS Route 53 latency-based routing is used for global server load balancing 
   ([GSLB](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/global-server-load-balancing-gslb/)).
   This allows for efficient distribution of traffic across resources that are globally distributed.
- Teleport's [Proxy Peering](../../architecture/proxy-peering.mdx) is used to reduce the total number of tunnel connections in the Teleport cluster.

This deployment architecture isn't recommended for use cases where your users or resources are 
clustered in a single region, or for Managed Service Providers needing to provide separate clusters 
to customers.

This architecture is best suited for globally distributed resources and end-users that prefer a single point of
entry while also ensuring minimal latency when accessing connected resources.

## Key deployment components

- Deployed exclusively in the AWS ecosystem
- High-availability Auto Scaling group of Auth Service instances that must remain in a single region
- High-availability Auto Scaling group of Proxy Service instances deployed across multiple regions
- [AWS Route 53 latency-based routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-latency.html) 
- [GSLB](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/global-server-load-balancing-gslb/)
- [Teleport TLS Routing](../../architecture/tls-routing.mdx) to reduce the number of ports needed to use Teleport
- [Teleport Proxy Peering](../../architecture/proxy-peering.mdx) for reducing the number of resource connections
- [AWS Network Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html)
- [AWS DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) for cluster state storage
- [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) for session recording storage

## Advantages of this deployment architecture

- Eliminates the complexity and cost of maintaining multiple Teleport clusters across multiple regions.
- Uses the lowest-latency path to connect users to resources.
- Provides a highly resilient, redundant HA architecture for Teleport that can quickly 
  scale with an organization's needs.
- All required Teleport components can be provisioned within the AWS ecosystem.
- Using load balancers for the Proxy and Auth Services allows for increased availability 
  during Teleport cluster upgrades.

## Disadvantages of this deployment architecture

- When Teleport Auth Service instances are limited to a single region, there is a higher likelihood 
  of decreased availability during an AWS regional outage.
- More technically complex to deploy than a single region Teleport cluster.

## AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB)
AWS NLBs are required for this highly available deployment architecture. 
The NLB forwards traffic from users and services to an available Teleport Proxy Service instance. This must not 
terminate TLS, and must transparently forward the TCP traffic it receives. 
In other words, this must be a Layer 4 load balancer, not a Layer 7 
(e.g., HTTP) load balancer. 

<Admonition

Cross-zone load balancing is required for the Auth and Proxy service NLB configurations to route 
traffic across multiple zones. Doing this improves resiliency against localized AWS zone outages.

### Configure the Proxy Service NLBs

Configure the load balancer to forward traffic from the following ports on the
load balancer to the corresponding port on an available Teleport instance.

<TabItem label="NLB Proxy ports">

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| `443` | ALPN port for TLS Routing, HTTPS connections to authenticate `tsh` users into the cluster, and to serve Teleport's Web UI |

</TabItem>

### Configure the Auth Service NLB

Configure the load balancer to forward traffic from the following ports on the
load balancer to the corresponding port on an available Teleport instance.

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Note"

Proxies must have network access to the Auth Service NLB. You can accomplish this
in the Route53 GSLB architecture using [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) 
or [Transit Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html).

Internal NLB Auth Service ports

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| `3025` | TLS port used by the Auth Service to serve its API to Proxies in a cluster |

## TLS credential provisioning 

High-availability Teleport deployments require a system to fetch TLS
credentials from a certificate authority like Let's Encrypt, AWS Certificate
Manager, Digicert, or a trusted internal authority. The system must then
provision Teleport Proxy Service instances with these credentials and renew them
periodically. 

For high-availability deployments that use Let's Encrypt to supply TLS
credentials to Teleport instances running behind a load balancer, you need
to use the [ACME
DNS-01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge)
challenge to demonstrate domain name ownership to Let's Encrypt. In this
challenge, your TLS credential provisioning system creates a DNS TXT record with
a value expected by Let's Encrypt.

## Global Server Load Balancing with Route 53

[Latency-based routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-latency.html) 
in a public hosted zone must be used to ensure traffic from Teleport 
resources are routed to the closest or lowest latency path Proxy NLB based on the region of 
the VPC the resource is connecting from.

To create GSLB routing, create a CNAME record for each region where you have VPCs containing Teleport connected resources.
It is recommended to add a wildcard record for every region if you plan to
register applications with Teleport.

The following CNAME record values need to be set:
- **Value:** The domain name of the NLB where `example-region-1` located Teleport resource traffic should be routed
- **Routing policy:** Latency
- **Region:** The AWS region from which traffic should be routed to the NLB listed in **Value**
- **Health Check ID:** It is recommended that you set this so that traffic is always routed to a healthy NLB

Example Hosted Zone using AWS Route53 Latency Routing to create GSLB:

### Root GSLB record for Teleport

|Record name|Type|Value|
|---|---|---|
|```*.teleport.example.com```|CNAME|AWS Route 53 nameservers|

### Teleport Proxy DNS records for GSLB

|Record name|Type|Routing Policy|Region|Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|```teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|us-west-1| ```elb.us-west-1.amazonaws.com``` |
|```*.teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|us-west-1| ```elb.us-west-1.amazonaws.com``` |
|```teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|eu-central-1| ```elb.eu_central-1.amazonaws.com```|
|```*.teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|eu-central-1| ```elb.eu_central-1.amazonaws.com```|

<Admonition title="Required permissions">

If you are using Let's Encrypt to provide TLS credentials to your Teleport
instances, the TLS credential system we mentioned earlier needs permissions to
manage Route53 DNS records in order to satisfy Let's Encrypt's DNS-01 challenge. 

</Admonition>

### Teleport resource agent configuration for GSLB

To facilitate latency-based routing, resource agents must be configured to point ```proxy_server:``` to 
the GSLB domain configured in Route53, **not** the specific proxy NLB address.

For example:

```
version: v3
teleport:
    nodename: ssh-node
    ...
    proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
    ...
    ssh_service:
        enabled: yes
    ...
```
Review the [configuration reference](../../reference/config.mdx) page for 
additional settings.       

## Configure Proxy Peering

In this deployment architecture, [Proxy Peering](../../architecture/proxy-peering.mdx) is used to restrict the number of connections made from 
resources to proxies in the Teleport Cluster.

This guide covers the necessary Proxy Peering settings for deploying an HA Teleport Cluster routing resource
traffic with GSLB. 

### Auth Service Proxy Peering configuration 

The Teleport Auth Service must be configured to use the `proxy_peering` tunnel strategy as shown in the example below:

```
auth_service:
 ...
 tunnel_strategy:
  type: proxy_peering
  agent_connection_count: 2
```
Reference the [Auth Server configuration](../../reference/config.mdx#auth-service) reference page 
for additional settings.

### Proxy Service Proxy Peering configuration 

Proxies must advertise a peer address for proxy peers to establish connections to each other.
The ports exposed on the Teleport Proxy Instances depends on whether you route Proxy Peering traffic over 
the public internet:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Public Proxy Peering ports">

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| `443` | ALPN port for TLS Routing, HTTPS connections to authenticate `tsh` users into the cluster, and to serve Teleport's Web UI |
| `3021`| Proxy Peering gRPC Stream  |

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="VPC peering Proxy Peering ports">

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| `443` | ALPN port for TLS Routing, HTTPS connections to authenticate `tsh` users into the cluster, and to serve Teleport's Web UI |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Set `peer_public_addr` to the specific name of that proxy. This is the recommended 
method for lowest latency and most reliable connection.

```
version: v3
teleport:
...
proxy_service:
  ...
  peer_public_addr: teleport-proxy-eu-west-1-host1.example.com:3021
  ...
```
<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Note"
>
`agent_connection_count` on the Auth service should be set to a value >=2 to decrease
the likelihood of agents being unavailable.
</Admonition>

Reference the [Proxy Service configuration](../../reference/config.mdx#proxy-service) reference page 
for additional settings.
