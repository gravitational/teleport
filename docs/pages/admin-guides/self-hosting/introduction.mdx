Teleport Enterprise is a commercial product built around Teleport's open source
core.

Like Teleport Enterprise Cloud, Teleport Enterprise includes advanced features
such as support for SAMLâ€“ and OIDC-based single sign-on providers as well as
Just-in-Time Access Requests through integrations with Slack, PagerDuty, and
more. Unlike Teleport Enterprise Cloud, Teleport Enterprise is self hosted,
giving you control over the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service for large
organizations with particular security needs and compliance requirements.

 You can compare editions in [How to Choose a Teleport
 Edition](../introduction.mdx).

## Get started with Teleport Enterprise

Teleport Enterprise Cloud offers most of the functionality available in
self-hosted deployments of Teleport Enterprise. If you are interested in trying
Teleport for the first time, we recommend signing up for a [free
trial](https://goteleport.com/signup) of Teleport Enterprise Cloud, which
manages the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service for you.

Once you have determined that your organization would benefit most from Teleport
Enterprise, [contact sales](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise/) to
discuss the best way to proceed with your self-hosted Teleport Enterprise
deployment.

For documentation on deploying a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster on your
platform, read  our [self-hosted production deployment
guides](../../deploy-a-cluster/introduction.mdx).
