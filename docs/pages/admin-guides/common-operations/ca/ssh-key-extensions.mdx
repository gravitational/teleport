title: Using Teleport's Certificate Authority with GitHub
description:  How to use Teleport's short-lived SSH certificates with the GitHub Certificate Authority.
---

Teleport supports exporting user SSH certificates with configurable key extensions. This allows the Teleport CA to be used in conjunction with GitHub's support for SSH Certificate Authorities. This way, users can access their organizations' repositories with short-lived, signed SSH certificates.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- Access to GitHub Enterprise and permissions to modify GitHub's SSH Certificate Authorities.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Import the Teleport CA into GitHub

In order to export the Teleport CA, execute the following command, assigning <Var name="proxy" /> to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```code
$ curl 'https://<Var name="proxy"/>/webapi/auth/export?type=user' | sed 's/^cert-authority //g'
```

Next, follow the instructions in the guide below to import your Teleport CA into GitHub:

[Managing your organization's SSH certificate authorities](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-your-organizations-ssh-certificate-authorities)

The contents of the exported `teleport.ca` file should by pasted into the "Key" field after clicking "New CA".

## Step 2/3. Configure the GitHub key extension

Create or update a role to include the `cert_extensions` option. The value of `name` must be `login@github.com`.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  options:
     cert_extensions:
       - type: ssh
         mode: extension
         name: login@github.com # required to be `login@github.com`.
         value: "{{ external.logins }}"
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="developer"!)

## Step 3/3. Issue a user certificate

A user certificate may be issued with the following command, where `<USERNAME>` is the Teleport user to generate the SSH certificate for:
```code
$ tctl auth sign --out out.cer --user=<USERNAME>
```

To test that authentication with this signed certificate is working correctly, SSH into `github.com` with your organization's user:
```code
$ ssh -i out.cer org-<ID>@github.com
```
If authentication is successful,  a "You've successfully authenticated" message should be displayed in the terminal.

This newly generated certificate may then be used when interacting with GitHub over SSH by adding the following to the `~/.ssh/config` file:

```code
Host github.com
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile path/to/out.cer
```

When using SSH Certificate Authorities, you should retrieve your GitHub repository's SSH URL from the GitHub UI so the correct SSH user is used for authentication. For more information, see [About SSH URLs with SSH certificates](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-git-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/about-ssh-certificate-authorities#about-ssh-urls-with-ssh-certificates).
