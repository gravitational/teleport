description: How to migrate from self-hosted Teleport to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.
h1: Migrate to Teleport cloud
---

This guide outlines the steps required to migrate your Teleport deployment from a self-hosted Teleport cluster to Teleport Cloud. 
The migration process involves transferring configurations, migrating Teleport agents, and ensuring successfully transition and performance on Teleport Cloud.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Teleport Self Hosted Cluster

- Determine the `teleport.sh` subdomain you would like to use for your new Cloud tenant. If your existing self-hosted Teleport Enterprise license dashboard is already using that subdomain, contact Teleport Support to facilitate the change.

- Ensure you are running compatible Teleport enterprise agent versions with the Teleport cloud tenant version.

- Validate connectivity to both the newly deployed Teleport enterprise cloud and existing self-hosted Cluster: You should be able to connect to your Teleport cluster and execute tctl commands using your current credentials. To verify connectivity, follow these steps:
  - Sign in to your Teleport cluster using `tsh login`.
  - Verify connectivity by running `tctl status`



## Next Steps:

### Deploy your Teleport Enterprise cloud tenant
- Reach out to your Account Management team to setup your Teleport Enterprise Cloud Tenant, [Contact Us](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise/). For more information, you may refer to our documentation on [signing up for a Teleport Enterprise Cloud account](https://goteleport.com/docs/choose-an-edition/teleport-cloud/introduction/)

  Ensure recovery codes are saved securely in order not to lose access! For your security, Teleport support cannot assist with resetting passwords or recovering lost credentials.

- Subscribe to the [Teleport Cloud status website](https://status.teleport.sh/) to stay current on any issues impacting Teleport Cloud performance.

### Validate connectivity  

To check that you can connect to your Teleport cloud tenant, using the tsh command-line tool sign in with tsh login, then verify that you can run tctl commands using your current credentials. tctl is supported on macOS and Linux machines. 
For example:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=example.teleport.sh --user=admin@example.com
$ tsh status && tctl status
```

If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your current credentials to run subsequent tctl commands from your workstation.

### Migrate Teleport Configurations.

Migrating Teleport configurations involves transferring essential resource configurations from your self-hosted cluster to Teleport Cloud. Teleport uses YAML configuration for these resources, hence, it is required to grab a backup of the dynamic resource configurations from the existing self-hosted cluster and restore the resource on the Teleport cloud. These resources include:  

- Roles
- Local users
- SSO authentication connectors

Review the [dynamic resources](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/resources/) list to see if any other resources need to be migrated.  Some common dynamic resources includes:
- windows_desktop
- apps
- dbs
- login_rule

  Trusted Clusters are no longer supported in Teleport Cloud.  You will not be able to migrate trusted cluster resources.

</Admonition>


To achieve this:
- Log in to your existing self-hosted Teleport cluster and export a collection of the above-mentioned dynamic resource configuration using the tctl administrative tool.  An example is shown below:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=admin@example.com
$ tctl get roles > roles.yaml 
$ tctl get users > users.yaml 
```

- Once you have the resource configuration file from the above, proceed to log in to your Teleport Cloud tenant with an admin user and create the resources from the exported files

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=example.teleport.sh --user=admin@example.com
$ tctl create -f  roles.yaml
$ tctl create -f  user.yaml
```

For your SSO auth connector, most SSO integrations only work for a single configured endpoint. It is recommended to create a separate SSO connector in your Identity Provider specifically for the Teleport Cloud endpoint, and configure a new Auth Connector in the Teleport Cloud tenant.


### Migrate Teleport Agents.

To ensure a successful migration process across your infrastructure, start by cataloging the various services you're managing with Teleport, The following resources should be considered for migration:
Teleport Agents (SSH, Kubernetes, Databases, Applications, Desktops)
Machine ID Bots
Access Request Plugins

The following procedure is required to successfully migrate your Teleport agents:

- Log in to your Teleport Enterpise cloud Tenant, You'll need to authenticate to access your Teleport Cloud resources and management interfaces.

- Obtain a valid join token: We recommend using a [Delegated Join Method](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/join-methods/#delegated-join-methods)

If using ephemeral tokens, ensure you specify the appropriate token type to match the Teleport services. Token types can include `node`, `app`, `Kube`, `DB`, `WindowsDesktop`, and others depending on the service you wish to join to your Teleport cluster.

In the following example, a new token is created with the TTL of fifteen minutes:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type node,app,db --ttl 15m
```

In this command, we assigned the token the `node`, `app` and `db` type, indicating that it will belong to an SSH Service, Database Service and Application Service instance.

Copy the token so you can use it later in this guide.

- Stop the Teleport service on the agent (if applicable)

- Update the `proxy_server` or `auth_server` field in the agent configuration file to point to the address of your Teleport cloud proxy. By default, the configuration is located in the `/etc/teleport.yaml` directory

```code
proxy_server:
- example.teleport.sh:443
```

- Update the auth_token field with the newly generated token. 

- Delete the local agent cache to force the agent to rejoin the new Teleport Cloud cluster. By default, the data is located in the  `/var/lib/teleport` directory

- Start the Teleport process on each agent or recycle the pod to apply the new configuration. This will cause the agents to re-register with the Teleport cloud cluster and obtain new certificates signed by the cloud cluster's certificate authority.

As new services come online, they start sending heartbeat requests every few seconds to the Auth Service. This allows users to explore cluster membership. 

Note: ​​Migration of agents can be done all at once or gradually, depending on your business requirements. If running teleport at scale, you'll generally want to leverage the use of a configuration management tool to automate and streamline the process of carrying out the actions involved in migrating agent configurations. 


### Verify end User Access and performance.

Once the migration is complete, validate that the resources are present in the Teleport cluster and verify their status and connectivity to ensure they are properly registered and available for connections. You can either check via the Web UI or use tctl to get a list of all resources and verify their registration and status. 
For example, to list all nodes registered with the Teleport cluster, you can run the command below

```
tctl nodes ls
```

Similarly, to list all registered Kubernetes clusters, you can run the command below:

```
tctl get kube_services
```

These tctl commands will show you the resources registered within your Teleport cluster, and you can verify their availability for connections

- Ensure that end users have the expected SSO access to your infrastructure and workflow.

Additionally, establish break glass access procedures to ensure access to infrastructure in case of Teleport Cloud unavailability.

### Conclusion

Migrating from a self-hosted Teleport deployment to Teleport Cloud offers scalability, reliability, and ease of management. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can transition your Teleport self-hosted deployment to the cloud successfully while ensuring minimal disruption to your operations.
