description: Explains the sections of the documentation.

This page provides a tour of the major sections of the Teleport documentation.

We maintain a separate version of the Teleport documentation for each major
version of Teleport that we support. If you are running a version earlier than
v(=teleport.major_version=), or want a preview of the next version's
documentation, adjust the dropdown menu at the top of the page.

## Get started

If you are curious to see how Teleport works, you can get started by [spinning
up a demo cluster](./index.mdx) on a Linux server. After seeing how your demo
Teleport cluster lets you securely access a server and play back your SSH
sessions, you can configure RBAC, add resources, and protect your infrastructure
with Teleport.

Once you are ready to learn more about Teleport, read our [Core Concepts
guide](./core-concepts.mdx), which introduces the components of a Teleport
cluster. You can refer to this glossary as you continue through the
documentation.

## Critical guides

Guides in the "Home" section include information that all Teleport users will
probably need to consult at some point:

- [Installation](./installation.mdx): How to install Teleport binaries on your
  environment. If you are just getting started with Teleport, we recommend
  spinning up a [demo cluster](./index.mdx) or signing up for a [Teleport
  Enterprise Cloud trial](https://goteleport.com/signup).
- [Frequently Asked Questions](./faq.mdx): If this page does not answer your
  question, try our AI-assisted search box on the left sidebar.
- [Usage Reporting and Billing](./usage-billing.mdx): How Teleport calculates
  usage metrics to determine customer billing.
- [Upcoming Releases](./upcoming-releases.mdx): Features to be introduced in
  future versions of Teleport.
- [Changelog](./changelog.mdx): A comprehensive collection of release notes.
- [Teleport Assist](./ai-assist.mdx): How to use the AI-guided Teleport client.

## Choose an edition

After trying out Teleport, you are ready to deploy a cluster to your
infrastructure. Teleport has three editions: 

- Teleport Enterprise Cloud
- Teleport Enterprise
- Teleport Community Edition

You can compare these in our [Choose an
Edition](./choose-an-edition/introduction.mdx) section.

## Deploy a cluster

Once you know which edition you would like to deploy, read our [Deploy a
Cluster](./deploy-a-cluster/introduction.mdx) documentation for how to launch a
fully fledged Teleport cluster in production. (If you are using Teleport
Enterprise Cloud, you can skip this step.) This section shows you the best
practices to follow for a high-availability Teleport cluster, and how to deploy
Teleport on your cloud provider of choice.

## Manage access

Now that you have a running Teleport cluster, set up role-based access controls
to enable secure access to your infrastructure. You can define roles with
granular permissions and use Teleport's integrations with Single Sign-On
providers to automatically map these roles to users. You can also set up Access
Requests to enable just-in-time access to your infrastructure. Read [Manage
Access](./access-controls/introduction.mdx) to get started.

## Manage your cluster

With your Teleport cluster configured, you can now begin Day Two operations
such as upgrades, adding agents to the cluster, and integrating Teleport with
third-party tools. Read [Manage your
Cluster](./management/introduction.mdx) for more information.

## Add your infrastructure

Teleport is protocol aware and provides functionality that is unique to each
protocol it supports. To enable access to a protocol, deploy the appropriate
Teleport service and configure it to communicate with resources in your
infrastructure. 

Set up the [Teleport Discovery
Service](./enroll-resources/auto-discovery/auto-discovery.mdx) to automatically
enroll infrastructure resources in your Teleport cluster.

Read about how to enable access to:

- [Servers](./enroll-resources/server-access/getting-started.mdx), including OpenSSH servers that
  [do not have Teleport installed](./enroll-resources/server-access/openssh/openssh.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](./enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Databases](./enroll-resources/database-access/database-access.mdx)
- [Applications](./enroll-resources/application-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Remote desktops](./enroll-resources/desktop-access/introduction.mdx)

You can also set up [Machine ID](./enroll-resources/machine-id/introduction.mdx) to enable
service accounts to access resources in your infrastructure with short-lived
credentials.

## Extend Teleport for your organization

Teleport is highly customizable, exposing much of its functionality via a gRPC
API. For example, you can build API clients to register infrastructure
automatically or manage Access Requests using your organization's unique
workflows. Read how to build applications that interact with Teleport's API in
our [API guides](./api/introduction.mdx).

## Learn more about Teleport

Get more information about Teleport by reading our library of architecture,
reference, and developer guides. See the
[Upcoming Releases](./upcoming-releases.mdx) section for a glimpse of features we
will release in the next Teleport version. Consult our
[Reference](./reference/introduction.mdx) guides for comprehensive lists of
configuration options, CLI flags, and more. For detailed explanations of how
Teleport works, see the [Architecture](./architecture/introduction.mdx) section.
