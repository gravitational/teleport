## Active Directory as an SSO provider for SSH authentication

This guide will cover how to configure Active Directory Federation Services
[ADFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services) to be
a single sign-on (SSO) provider to issue
SSH credentials to specific groups of users. When used in combination with role
based access control (RBAC) it allows SSH administrators to define policies
like:

- Only members of "DBA" group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.
- ... and many others.

  This guide requires a commercial edition of Teleport. The open source
  edition of Teleport only supports [Github](../../admin-guide.mdx#github-oauth-20) as
  an SSO provider.

## Enable ADFS Authentication

First, configure Teleport auth server to use ADFS authentication instead of the local
user database. Update `/etc/teleport.yaml` as shown below and restart the
teleport daemon.

```yaml
auth_service:
    authentication:
        type: saml
```

## Configure ADFS

You'll need to configure ADFS to export claims about a user (Claims Provider
Trust in ADFS terminology) and you'll need to configure AD FS to trust
Teleport (a Relying Party Trust in ADFS terminology).

For Claims Provider Trust configuration you'll need to specify at least the
following two incoming claims: `Name ID` and `Group`. `Name ID` should be a
mapping of the LDAP Attribute `E-Mail-Addresses` to `Name ID`. A group
membership claim should be used to map users to roles (for example to
separate normal users and admins).

![Group Configuration](../../../img/adfs-2.png)

In addition if you are using dynamic roles (see below), it may be useful to map
the LDAP Attribute `SAM-Account-Name` to `Windows account name` and create
another mapping of `E-Mail-Addresses` to `UPN`.

![UPN Configuration](../../../img/adfs-4.png)

You'll also need to create a Relying Party Trust, use the below information to
help guide you through the Wizard. Note, for development purposes we recommend
using `https://localhost:3080/v1/webapi/saml/acs` as the Assertion Consumer
Service (ACS) URL, but for production you'll want to change this to a domain
that can be accessed by other users as well.

- Create a claims aware trust.
- Enter data about the relying party manually.
- Set the display name to something along the lines of "Teleport".
- Skip the token encryption certificate.
- Select *"Enable support for SAML 2.0 Web SSO protocol"* and set the URL to `https://localhost:3080/v1/webapi/saml/acs`.
- Set the relying party trust identifier to `https://localhost:3080/v1/webapi/saml/acs` as well.
- For access control policy select *"Permit everyone"*.

Once the Relying Party Trust has been created, update the Claim Issuance Policy
for it. Like before make sure you send at least `Name ID` and `Group` claims to the
relying party (Teleport). If you are using dynamic roles, it may be useful to
map the LDAP Attribute `SAM-Account-Name` to *"Windows account name"* and create
another mapping of `E-Mail-Addresses` to *"UPN"*.

Lastly, ensure the user you create in Active Directory has an email address
associated with it. To check this open Server Manager then
*"Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers"* and select the user and right
click and open properties. Make sure the email address field is filled out.

## Create Teleport Roles

Lets create two Teleport roles: one for administrators and the other is for
normal users. You can create them using `tctl create {file name}` CLI command
or via the Web UI.

```yaml
# admin-role.yaml
kind: "role"
version: "v3"
metadata:
  name: "admin"
spec:
  options:
    max_session_ttl: "8h0m0s"
  allow:
    logins: [ root ]
    node_labels:
      "*": "*"
    rules:
      - resources: ["*"]
        verbs: ["*"]
```

```yaml
# user-role.yaml
kind: "role"
version: "v3"
metadata:
  name: "dev"
spec:
  options:
    # regular users can only be guests and their certificates will have a TTL of 1 hour:
    max_session_ttl: "1h"
  allow:
    # only allow login as either ubuntu or the 'windowsaccountname' claim
    logins: [ '{{external["http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"]}}', ubuntu ]
    node_labels:
      "access": "relaxed"
```

This role declares:

- Devs are only allowed to login to nodes labelled with `access: relaxed` label.
- Developers can log in as `ubuntu` user
- Notice `{{external["http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"]}}` login. It configures Teleport to look at
  *"[http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname"](http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname")* ADFS claim and use that field as an allowed login for each user.
  Also note the double quotes (`"`) and square brackets (`[]`) around the claim name - these are important.
- Developers also do not have any "allow rules" i.e. they will not be able to
  see/replay past sessions or re-configure the Teleport cluster.

Next, create a SAML connector [resource](../../setup/reference/resources.mdx):

```yaml
(!examples/resources/adfs-connector.yaml!)
```

The `acs` field should match the value you set in ADFS earlier and you can
obtain the `entity_descriptor_url` from ADFS under *"ADFS -> Service -> Endpoints -> Metadata"*.

The `attributes_to_roles` is used to map attributes to the Teleport roles you
just created. In our situation, we are mapping the *"Group"* attribute whose full
name is `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group` with a value of *"admins"*
to the *"admin"* role. Groups with the value *"users"* is being mapped to the
*"users"* role.

## Export the Signing Key

For the last step, you'll need to export the signing key:

```bsh
$ tctl saml export adfs
```

Save the output to a file named `saml.crt`, return back to ADFS, open the
"Relying Party Trust" and add this file as one of the signature verification
certificates.

## Testing

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with MS Active Directory". The CLI is
the same as before:

```bsh
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL (and will try to open it
automatically in a browser).

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  Teleport can use multiple SAML connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=connector_name`
</Admonition>

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="IMPORTANT"
>
  Teleport only supports sending party initiated flows for SAML 2.0. This
  means you can not initiate login from your identity provider, you have to
  initiate login from either the Teleport Web UI or CLI.
</Admonition>

## Troubleshooting

If you get "access denied errors" the number one place to check is the audit
log on the Teleport auth server. It is located in `/var/lib/teleport/log` by
default and it will contain the detailed reason why a user's login was denied.

Some errors (like filesystem permissions or misconfigured network) can be
diagnosed using Teleport's `stderr` log, which is usually available via:

```bsh
$ sudo journalctl -fu teleport
```

If you wish to increase the verbosity of Teleport's syslog, you can pass
`--debug` flag to `teleport start` command.
