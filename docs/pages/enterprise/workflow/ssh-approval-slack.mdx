h1: Teleport Slack Plugin Setup

This guide will talk through how to setup Teleport with Slack. Teleport to Slack integration allows you to treat Teleport access and permission requests via Slack message and inline interactive components.

<Admonition type="tip">
  The Access Request workflow is now supported in both the Teleport Open Source and Enterprise Editions.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have:

- Teleport Enterprise 4.2.8 or newer
- Admin privileges with access to `tctl`
- Slack Admin Privileges to create an app and install it to your workspace.

#### Create User and Role for access

Log into Teleport Authentication Server, this is where you normally run `tctl`. Create a
new user and role that only has API access to the `access_request` API. The below script
will create a yaml resource file for a new user and role.

Create a non-interactive bot `access-plugin` user and role.

```bash
kind: user
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  roles: ['access-plugin']
version: v2
---
kind: role
version: v3
metadata:
  name: access-plugin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['access_request']
        verbs: ['list', 'read']
      - resources: ['access_plugin_data']
        verbs: ['update']
    # teleport currently refuses to issue certs for a user with 0 logins,
    # this restriction may be lifted in future versions.
    logins: ['access-plugin-not-used']
```

Here and below follow along and create yaml resources using `tctl create -f`:

```
$ tctl create -f access.yaml
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you're using other plugins, you might want to create different users and roles for different plugins
</Admonition>

#### Export access-plugin Certificate

Teleport Plugin use the `access-plugin` role and user to perform the approval. We export the identity files, using [`tctl auth sign`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl-auth-sign).

```bash
sudo tctl auth sign --format=tls --user=access-plugin --out=auth --ttl=1h
# ...
```

The above sequence should result in three PEM encoded files being generated: auth.crt, auth.key, and auth.cas (certificate, private key, and CA certs respectively).  We'll reference the auth.crt, auth.key, and auth.cas files later when [configuring the plugins](#configuring-teleport-slack).

<Admonition

  By default, [`tctl auth sign`](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/cli-docs/#tctl-auth-sign) produces certificates with a relatively short lifetime. For production deployments, the `--ttl` flag can be used to ensure a more practical certificate lifetime. `--ttl=8760h` exports a 1 year token
</Admonition>

### Create Slack App

We'll create a new Slack app and setup auth tokens and callback URLs, so that Slack knows how to notify the Teleport plugin when Approve / Deny buttons are clicked.

You'll need to:

1. Create a new app, pick a name and select a workspace it belongs to.
2. Add OAuth Scopes. This is required by Slack for the app to be installed — we'll only need a single scope to post messages to your Slack account.
3. Obtain OAuth token

#### Creating a New Slack app

Visit [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) to create a new Slack App.

**App Name:** Teleport<br/>
**Development Slack Workspace:** Pick the workspace you'd like the requests to show up in. <br/>
**App Icon:** <a href="../../../img/enterprise/plugins/teleport_bot@2x.png" download>Download Teleport Bot Icon</a>

![Create Slack App](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/slack/Create-a-Slack-App.png)

#### Selecting OAuth Scopes

On the App screen, go to “OAuth and Permissions” under Features in the sidebar menu. Then scroll to Scopes, and add `chat:write, incoming-webhook, users:read, users:read.email` scopes so that our plugin can post messages to your Slack channels.

#### Obtain OAuth Token

#### Add to Workspace

After adding to the workspace, you still need to invite the bot to the channel. Do this by using the @ command,
and inviting them to the channel.

## Installing the Teleport Slack Plugin

We recommend installing the Teleport Plugins alongside the Teleport Proxy. This is an ideal
location as plugins have a low memory footprint, and will require both public internet access
and Teleport Auth access.  We currently only provide linux-amd64 binaries, you can also
compile these plugins from [source](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins/tree/master/access/slack).

**Install the plugin**

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Download">
  ```bash
  $ curl -L https://get.gravitational.com/teleport-access-slack-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ tar -xzf teleport-access-slack-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
  $ cd teleport-access-slack
  $ ./install
  ```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="From Source">
  To install from source you need `git` and `go >= (=teleport.golang=)` installed.

  ```bash
  # Checkout teleport-plugins
  $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/teleport-plugins.git
  $ cd teleport-plugins/access/slack
  $ make
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Run `./install` in from 'teleport-slack' or place the executable in the appropriate `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` on the server installation.

### Configuring Teleport Slack

Teleport Slack uses a config file in TOML format. Generate a boilerplate config by
running the following command:

```bash
$ teleport-slack configure > teleport-slack.toml
$ sudo mv teleport-slack.toml /etc
```

Then, edit the config as needed.

```yaml
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-slack.toml!)
```

#### Editing the config file

In the Teleport section, use the certificates you've generated with `tctl auth sign` before. The plugin installer creates a folder for those certificates in `/var/lib/teleport/plugins/slack/` — so just move the certificates there and make sure the config points to them.

In Slack section, use the OAuth token, signing token, setup the desired channel name. The listen URL is the URL the plugin will listen for Slack callbacks.


```conf
(!examples/resources/plugins/teleport-slack.toml!)
```

## Test Run

Assuming that Teleport is running, and you've created the Slack app, the plugin config,
and provided all the certificates — you can now run the plugin and test the workflow!

```bash
$ teleport-slack start
```

If everything works fine, the log output should look like this:

```bash
$ teleport-slack start
INFO   Starting Teleport Access Slack (=teleport.plugin.version=).1-0-slack/main.go:145
INFO   Starting a request watcher... slack/main.go:330
INFO   Starting insecure HTTP server on 0.0.0.0:8081 utils/http.go:64
INFO   Watcher connected slack/main.go:298
```

### Testing the approval workflow

You can create a test permissions request with `tctl` and check if the plugin works as expected like this:

#### Create a test permissions request behalf of a user

```bash
# Replace USERNAME with a Teleport local user, and TARGET_ROLE with a Teleport Role
$ tctl request create USERNAME --roles=TARGET_ROLE
```

A user can also try using `--request-roles` flag.

```bash
# Example with a user trying to request a role DBA.
$ tsh login --request-roles=dba
```

#### Approve or deny the request on Slack

The messages should automatically get updated to reflect the action you just clicked. You can also check the request status with `tctl`:

```bash
$ tctl request ls
```

### TSH User Login and Request Admin Role

You can also test the full workflow from the user's perspective using `tsh`:

```bash
# tsh login --request-roles=REQUESTED_ROLE
Seeking request approval... (id: 8f77d2d1-2bbf-4031-a300-58926237a807)
```

You should now see a new request in Teleport, and a message about the request on Slack. You can
approve or deny it and `tsh` should login successfully or error out right after you click an action button on Slack.

### Setup with SystemD

In production, we recommend starting teleport plugin daemon via an init system like systemd .
Here's the recommended Teleport Plugin service unit file for systemd:

```bash
(!examples/systemd/plugins/teleport-slack.service!)
```

Save this as `teleport-slack.service`.

## Audit Log

The plugin will let anyone with access to the Slack Channel so it's
important to review Teleport' audit log.

## Feedback
