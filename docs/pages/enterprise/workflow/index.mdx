---

Teleport Just-in-time Access Requests allow any developer to request access to
a resource or role depending on need. The request can then be approved or
denied based on a configurable number of approvers.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss"]}>

Just-in-time Access Requests are a feature of Teleport Enterprise.
Open-source Teleport users can get a preview of how Access Requests work by
requesting a role via the Teleport CLI. Full access request functionality,
including Resource Access Requests and an intuitive and searchable UI are
available in Teleport Enterprise.

## Resource Access Requests

Resource Access Requests follow the principle of least privilege. On teams
leveraging Teleport, engineers can easily get access to only the individual
resources they need, when they need it.

[Get started with Resource Access Requests](./resource-requests.mdx).

## Role Access Requests

Role Access Requests balance security and flexibility. Engineers can request
temporary credentials with elevated roles in order to perform critical
system-wide tasks.

[Get started with Role Access Requests](./role-requests.mdx).
