h1: Single Sign-On (SSO) for SSH

Users of the Enterprise edition of Teleport can login with SSH, Kubernetes, Databases and Web applications
through a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider used the rest of the organization.

## How does SSO work?

Users need to execute the following command login in the CLI or login using UI:

```bsh
# this command will automatically open the default web browser and take a user
# through the login process with an SSO provider:
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --auth=github

# output:
If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
http://127.0.0.1:45235/055a310a-1099-43ea-8cf6-ffc41d88ad1f
```

Teleport will wait for up to 3 minutes for a user to authenticate. If authentication
succeeds, Teleport will retrieve an SSH and X.509 certificates and will store them in
`~/.tsh/keys/proxy.example.com` directory. The tool will also will add SSH cert to an
SSH agent if there's one running.

## Configuring SSO

Teleport works with SSO providers by relying on a concept called
*"authentication connector"*. An auth connector is a plugin which controls how
a user logs in and which group he or she belongs to.

The following connectors are supported:

- `local` connector type uses the built-in user database. This database can be
  manipulated by the `tctl users` command.
- `saml` connector type uses the [SAML protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)
  to authenticate users and query their group membership.
- `oidc` connector type uses the [OpenID Connect protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)
  to authenticate users and query their group membership.

To configure SSO, a Teleport administrator must:

- Update `/etc/teleport.yaml` on the auth server to set the default
  authentication connector.
- Define the connector [resource](../setup/reference/resources.mdx) and save it into
  a YAML file (like `connector.yaml`)
- Create the connector using `tctl create connector.yaml`.

```yaml
# snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml on the auth server:
auth_service:
    # defines the default authentication connector type:
    authentication:
        type: saml
```

An example of a connector:

```yaml
# connector.yaml
kind: saml
version: v2
metadata:
  name: corporate
spec:
  # display allows to set the caption of the "login" button
  # in the Web interface
  display: "Okta"

  acs: https://teleport-proxy.example.com:3080/v1/webapi/saml/acs
  attributes_to_roles:
    - {name: "groups", value: "okta-admin", roles: ["access"]}
    - {name: "groups", value: "okta-dev", roles: ["dev"]}

     # note that wildcards can also be used. the next line instructs Teleport
     # to assign "access" role to any user who has the SAML attribute that begins with "admin":
     - { name: "group", value: "admin*", roles: ["access"] }
     # regular expressions with capture are also supported. the next line instructs Teleport
     # to assign users to roles `admin-1` if his SAML "group" attribute equals 'ssh_admin_1':
     - { name: "group", value: "^ssh_admin_(.*)$", roles: ["admin-$1"] }

  entity_descriptor: |
    <paste SAML XML contents here>
```

- See [examples/resources](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/resources)
  directory in the Teleport Github repository for examples of possible connectors.
- You may use `entity_descriptor_url`, in lieu of `entity_descriptor`, to fetch the entity descriptor from
  your IDP. Though, we recommend "pinning" the entity descriptor by including the XML rather than fetching from a URL.

### User Logins

Often it is required to restrict SSO users to their unique UNIX logins when they
connect to Teleport nodes. To support this:

- Use the SSO provider to create a field called *"unix_login"* (you can use another name).
- Make sure it's exposed as a claim via SAML/OIDC.
- Update a Teleport SSH role to include `{{external.unix_login}}` variable into the list of allowed logins:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: sso_user
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    - '{{external.unix_login}}'
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

### Provider-Specific Workarounds

Certain SSO providers may require or benefit from changes to Teleport's SSO
flow. These provider-specific changes can be enabled by setting the
`spec.provider` property of the connector definition to one of the following
values to match your identity provider:

- `adfs` (SAML): Required for compatibility with Active Directory (ADFS); refer
  to the full [ADFS guide](./sso/adfs.mdx#create-teleport-roles) for details.
- `netiq` (OIDC): Used to enable NetIQ-specific ACR value processing; refer to
  the [OIDC guide](./sso/oidc.mdx#optional-acr-values) for details.
- `ping` (SAML and OIDC): Required for compatibility with Ping Identity (including
  PingOne and PingFederate).

At this time, the `spec.provider` field should not be set for any other identity providers.

## Working with External Email Identity

Along with sending groups, an SSO provider will also provide a user's email address.
In many organizations, the username that a person uses to log into a system is the
same as the first part of their email address - the 'local' part. For example, `dave.smith@acme.com` might log in with the username `dave.smith`. Teleport provides an easy way to extract the first part of an email address so it can be used as a username - this is the `{{email.local}}` function.

If the email claim from the identity provider (which can be accessed via `{{external.email}}`) is sent and contains an email address, you can extract the 'local' part of the email address before the @ sign like this: `{{email.local(external.email)}}`

Here's how this looks in a Teleport role:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: sso_user
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    # Extracts the local part of dave.smith@acme.com, so the login will
    # now support dave.smith.
    - '{{email.local(external.email)}}'
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

## Multiple SSO Providers

Teleport can also support multiple connectors, i.e. a Teleport administrator
can define and create multiple connector resources using `tctl create` as shown above.

To see all configured connectors, execute this on the auth server:

```bash
$ tctl get connectors
```

To delete/update connectors, use the usual `tctl rm` and `tctl create` commands
as described in the [Resources Reference](../setup/reference/resources.mdx).

If multiple authentication connectors exist, the clients must supply a
connector name to `tsh login` via `--auth` argument:

```bsh
# use "okta" SAML connector:
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login --auth=okta

# use local Teleport user DB:
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login --auth=local --user=admin
```

Refer to the following guides to configure authentication connectors of both
SAML and OIDC types:

- [SSH Authentication with Okta](./sso/okta.mdx)
- [SSH Authentication with OneLogin](./sso/one-login.mdx)
- [SSH Authentication with ADFS](./sso/adfs.mdx)
- [SSH Authentication with OAuth2 / OpenID Connect](./sso/oidc.mdx)

## SSO Customization

| Provider | YAML | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Github | `display: Github` | ![github](../../img/teleport-sso/github@2x.png) |
| Microsoft | `display: Microsoft` | ![microsoft](../../img/teleport-sso/microsoft@2x.png) |
| Google | `display: Google` | ![google](../../img/teleport-sso/google@2x.png) |
| BitBucket | `display: Bitbucket` | ![bitbucket](../../img/teleport-sso/bitbucket@2x.png) |
| OpenID | `display: Okta` | ![Okta](../../img/teleport-sso/openId@2x.png) |

## Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting SSO configuration can be challenging. Usually a Teleport administrator
must be able to:

- Ensure that HTTP/TLS certificates are configured properly for both Teleport
  proxy and the SSO provider.
- Be able to see what SAML/OIDC claims and values are getting exported and passed
  by the SSO provider to Teleport.
- Be able to see how Teleport maps the received claims to role mappings as defined
  in the connector.

If something is not working, we recommend to:

- Double-check the host names, tokens and TCP ports in a connector definition.
- Look into Teleport's audit log for claim mapping problems. It is usually stored on the
  auth server in the `/var/lib/teleport/log` directory.ad
