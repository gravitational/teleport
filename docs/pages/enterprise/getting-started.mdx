h1: Teleport Enterprise Quick Start
---

Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for Teleport Enterprise.

The goal of this document is to show off the basic capabilities of Teleport.
There are three types of services Teleport nodes can run: `nodes`, `proxies`
and `auth servers`.

- **Auth servers** store user accounts and
  provide authentication and authorization services for every node and every
  user in a cluster.
- **Proxy servers** route client connection requests to the appropriate node and serve a
  Web UI which can also be used to log into SSH nodes. Every client-to-node
  connection in Teleport must be routed via a proxy.
- **Nodes** provide access to resources including SSH, Kubernetes, web applications
  and databases.  In this quick start guide we are highlighting the SSH service. This SSH service
  is similar to the `sshd` daemon you may be familiar
  with. When a node receives a connection request, the request is authenticated
  through the cluster's auth server.

The `teleport` daemon runs all three of these services by default. This Quick
Start Guide will be using this default behavior to create a cluster and
interact with it using Teleport's client-side tools:

| Tool | Description |
| - | - |
| tctl | Cluster administration tool used to invite nodes to a cluster and manage user accounts. |
| tsh | Allows users to authenticate and access resources via their local machine. `tsh`'s ssh functionality is similar in principle to OpenSSH's `ssh`. Users can login into remote SSH nodes, list and search for nodes in a cluster, securely upload/download files, etc. |
| browser | You can use your web browser to login into any Teleport node by opening `https://<proxy-host>:3080`. |

## Prerequisites

You will need to have access to the [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login)
to download the software. You will also need three computers: two servers and
one client (probably a laptop) to complete this tutorial. Let's assume the servers have
the following DNS names and IPs:

| Server Name | IP Address | Purpose |
| - | - | - |
| *"auth.example.com"* | 10.1.1.10 | This server will be used to run all three Teleport services: auth, proxy and ssh. |
| *"node.example.com"* | 10.1.1.11 | This server will only run the SSH service. |

This Quick Start Guide assumes that both servers are running a [systemd-based](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/)
Linux distribution such as Debian, Ubuntu or a RHEL derivative.  The *node.example.com* must be able to connect to the *auth.example.com* `3025` port and the *auth.example.com* must be able to connect to the 3022 port on *node.example.com*.

## Optional: Quickstart using Docker

The instructions below describe how to install Teleport Enterprise directly onto your test system. You can also [run Teleport Enterprise using Docker](#run-teleport-enterprise-using-docker)
if you don't want to install Teleport Enterprise binaries straight away.

## Installing

To start using Teleport Enterprise, you will need to Download the binaries and the license file from the [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login).
After downloading the binary tarball, run:

```bsh
$ tar -xzf teleport-ent-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
$ cd teleport-ent
```

- Copy `teleport` and `tctl` binaries to a bin directory (we suggest `/usr/local/bin`) on the auth server.
- Copy `teleport` binary to a bin directory on the node server.
- Copy `tsh` binary to a bin directory on the client computer.

### License File

The Teleport license file contains a X.509 certificate and the corresponding
private key in [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhanced_Electronic_Mail).

Download the license file from the [customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login)
and save it as `/var/lib/teleport/license.pem` on the auth server.

### Systemd Unit File

Next, download the systemd service unit file from [examples directory](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/systemd)
on Github and save it as `/etc/systemd/system/teleport.service` on both servers.

```bsh
# run this on both servers:
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable teleport
```

### Configuration File

Save the following configuration file as `/etc/teleport.yaml` on the *auth.example.com*:

```yaml
teleport:
  nodename: auth.example.com
  auth_token: dogs-are-much-nicer-than-cats
  auth_servers: [ "localhost:3025" ]

proxy_service:
  # enable the proxy service
  enabled: true

auth_service:
  # enable the auth service:
  enabled: true

  tokens:
  # this static token is used for other nodes to join this Teleport cluster
  - proxy,node:dogs-are-much-nicer-than-cats
  # this token is used to establish trust with other Teleport clusters
  - trusted_cluster:trains-are-superior-to-cars

  # by default, local authentication will be used with 2FA
  authentication:
      second_factor: otp

  # SSH is also enabled on this node:
ssh_service:
  enabled: "yes"
```

## Start Teleport on *auth.example.com*

Start the Teleport service and confirm the service has started. After it has started you can get the Certificate Authority (CA) pin that has been generated.

```bsh
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
# confirm Teleport started
$ sudo systemctl status teleport
# after successful start retrieve the CA pin for using in the node
$ sudo tctl status
Cluster  teleport
Version  (=version=)
Host CA  never updated
User CA  never updated
Jwt CA   never updated
CA pin   sha256:58b1c5cb8885d84ce08f3e3a47acb33d49841f12dd7648c0c1dd31bd501628
```

Save the following configuration file as `/etc/teleport.yaml` on the *node.example.com*:

!!! note "Note"

Make sure to replace the ca_pin with the above `tctl status` output and the right auth server address.

```yaml
teleport:
  nodename: node.example.com
  auth_token: dogs-are-much-nicer-than-cats
  # you can also use auth server's IP, i.e. "10.1.1.10:3025"
  auth_servers: [ "auth.example.com:3025" ]
  # Set the ca_pin value so it can verify the Teleport server
  ca_pin: sha256:58b1c5cb8885d84ce08f3e...

  # enable ssh service and disable auth and proxy:
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Start Node service

```bsh
# run this on node server:
$ sudo systemctl start teleport
# Confirm node has started successfully and connected
$ sudo systemctl status teleport
```

## Teleport Status and Networking

You can review the logs of the Teleport service with `journalctl -fu teleport` and see its current status
with `sudo systemctl status teleport`.

You can use `netstat -lptne` to review the port that Teleport is
listening on  on [TCP/IP ports](../setup/reference/networking.mdx#ports). On *auth.example.com*, it should
look something like this:

```bsh
$ auth.example.com ~: sudo netstat -lptne
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address   State       User       PID/Program name
tcp6       0      0 :::3024         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3025         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3080         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3022         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
tcp6       0      0 :::3023         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
```

and *node.example.com* should look something like this:

```bsh
$ node.example.com ~: sudo netstat -lptne
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address   State       User       PID/Program name
tcp6       0      0 :::3022         LISTEN      0          337/teleport
```

See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the bottom if something is not working.

## Adding Users

This portion of the Quick Start Guide should be performed on the auth server, i.e.
on *auth.example.com*

Every user in a Teleport cluster must be assigned at least one role. By default,
Teleport comes with several pre-configured roles known as
["presets"](../access-controls/reference.mdx#preset-roles). You can see
these roles by executing `sudo tctl get roles`.

Pay attention to the *allow/logins* field in the role definition: by default, this
role only allows SSH logins as `root@host`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: access
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    - '{{internal.logins}}'
    - root
```

You probably want to replace "root" with something else. Let's assume there will
be a local UNIX account called "admin" on all hosts. In this case you can
dump the role definition YAML into a file and update "allow/logins"
to look like this:

```yaml
allow:
   logins: [admin]
```

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Note"
>
  See the [Kubernetes Guide](../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) and [Application Guide](../application-access/introduction.mdx) for enabling access to additional resources.
</Admonition>

Then send it back into Teleport:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl create -f role.yaml
```

Now, lets create a new Teleport user "joe" with "access" role:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl users add --roles=access --logins=joe,ubuntu,ec2-user joe

Signup token has been created and is valid for 1 hours. Share this URL with the user:
https://auth.example.com:3080/web/newuser/22e3acb6a0c2cde22f13bdc879ff9d2a
```

Share the generated sign-up URL with Joe and let him pick a password and configure
the second factor authentication. We recommend [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator)
which is available for both Android and iPhone.

## Assigning Roles

To update user's roles, dump the user resource into a file:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl get users/joe > joe.yaml
```

Edit the YAML file and update the "roles" array.
Then, re-insert it back:

```bsh
$ sudo tctl create -f joe.yaml
```

## Logging In

Joe now has a local account on a Teleport cluster. The local account is good for
administrative purposes but regular users of Teleport Enterprise should be using
a Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism.

But first, lets see how Joe can log into the Teleport cluster. He can do this
on his client laptop:

```bsh
$ tsh --proxy=auth.example.com --insecure login --user=joe
```

Note that "--user=joe" part can be omitted if `$USER` environment variable is "joe".

Notice that `tsh` client always needs `--proxy` flag because all client connections
in Teleport always must to go through an SSH proxy, sometimes called an "SSH bastion".

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  For the purposes of this quickstart we are using the `--insecure` flag which allows
  us to skip configuring the HTTPS/TLS certificate for Teleport proxy. Your browser will
  throw a warning **Your connection is not private**. Click Advanced, and **Proceed to 0.0.0.0 (unsafe)**
  to preview the Teleport UI.

  Never use `--insecure` in production unless you terminate SSL at a load balancer. This will
  apply to most cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure). You must configure a HTTP/TLS certificate for the Proxy.
  This process has been made easier with Let's Encrypt. [We've instructions here](https://goteleport.com/blog/letsencrypt-teleport-ssh/).
</Admonition>

If successful, `tsh login` command will receive Joe's user certificate and will
store it in `~/.tsh/keys/<proxy>` directory.

With a certificate in place, Joe can now interact with the Teleport cluster:

```bsh
# SSH into any host behind the proxy (Unix user 'joe' should already exist on the node):
$ tsh ssh joe@node.example.com

# See what hosts are available behind the proxy:
$ tsh ls

# Log out (this will remove the user certificate from ~/.tsh)
$ tsh logout
```

## Configuring SSO

The local account is good for administrative purposes but regular users of
Teleport Enterprise should be using a Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism that use SAML or OIDC protocols.

Take a look at the [Single Sign-on](sso.mdx) chapter to learn the basics of
integrating Teleport with SSO providers. We have the following detailed guides for
configuring SSO providers:

- [Okta](sso/okta.mdx)
- [Active Directory](sso/adfs.mdx)
- [One Login](sso/one-login.mdx)
- [Github](../setup/admin/github-sso.mdx)

Any SAML-compliant provider can be configured with Teleport by following the
same steps.  There are Teleport Enterprise customers who are using Oracle IDM,
SailPoint and others.

## Run Teleport Enterprise using Docker

We provide pre-built Docker images for every version of Teleport Enterprise. These images are hosted on quay.io.

- [All tags under `quay.io/gravitational/teleport-ent` are Teleport Enterprise images](https://quay.io/repository/gravitational/teleport-ent?tag=latest\&tab=tags)

We currently only offer Docker images for `x86_64` architectures.

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=\&type=edition\&offering=community) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning">
  This setup will not let you 'SSH into' the node that is running Teleport without additional configuration.
</Admonition>

### Pick your image

This table gives an idea of how our image naming scheme works. We offer images which point to a static version of Teleport Enterprise, as well as images which are
automatically rebuilt every night. These nightly images point to the latest version of Teleport Enterprise from the three most recent release branches.
They are stable, and we recommend their use to easily keep your Teleport Enterprise installation up to date.

| Image name | Open Source or Enterprise? | Teleport version | Image automatically updated? | Image base |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| `(=teleport.latest_ent_docker_image=)` | Enterprise | The latest version of Teleport Enterprise (=version=) | Yes | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu) |
| `(=teleport.latest_ent_docker_image=)-fips` | Enterprise FIPS | The latest version of Teleport Enterprise (=version=) FIPS | Yes | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu) |
| `quay.io/gravitational/teleport-ent:(=teleport.version=)` | Enterprise | The version specified in the image's tag (i.e. (=teleport.version=)) | No | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu) |
| `quay.io/gravitational/teleport-ent:(=teleport.version=)-fips` | Enterprise FIPS | The version specified in the image's tag (i.e. (=teleport.version=)) | No | [Ubuntu 20.04](https://hub.docker.com/\_/ubuntu) |

For testing, we always recommend that you use the latest release version of Teleport Enterprise, which is currently `(=teleport.latest_ent_docker_image=)`.

### Quickstart using docker-compose

<Admonition type="note">
  You will need a recent version of [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed to follow this section of the quick start guide.
</Admonition>

The easiest way to start Teleport Enterprise quickly is to use `docker-compose` with our [`teleport-ent-quickstart.yml`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/docker/teleport-ent-quickstart.yml) file:

```code
# download the quickstart file from our Github repo
$ curl -Lso teleport-ent-quickstart.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/master/docker/teleport-ent-quickstart.yml

# start teleport quickstart using docker-compose
$ docker-compose -f teleport-ent-quickstart.yml up
```

- The `docker-compose` quickstart will automatically create a config file for you at `./docker/teleport/config/teleport.yaml`
- This config is mounted into the container under `/etc/teleport/teleport.yaml`
- It will also start `teleport` using this config file, with Teleport's data directory set to `./docker/teleport/data` and mounted under `/var/lib/teleport`
- It will mount your license file (named `license.pem`) from the current directory into the Docker container
- By default, `docker-compose` will output Teleport's logs to the console for you to observe.
  - If you would rather run the Teleport container in the background, use `docker-compose -f teleport-ent-quickstart.yml up -d`
  - You can stop the Teleport container using `docker-compose -f teleport-ent-quickstart.yml down`

### Quickstart using docker run

If you'd prefer to complete these steps manually, here's some sample `docker run` commands:

```code
# create local config and data directories for teleport, which will be mounted into the container
$ mkdir -p ~/teleport/config ~/teleport/data

# download your license file from the Gravitational dashboard and put it in the correct directory
# the file needs to be named license.pem
$ cp ~/downloads/downloaded-license.pem ~/teleport/data/license.pem

# generate a sample teleport config and write it to the local config directory
# this container will write the config and immediately exit - this is expected
$ docker run --hostname localhost --rm \
  --entrypoint=/bin/sh \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  (=teleport.latest_ent_docker_image=) -c "teleport configure > /etc/teleport/teleport.yaml"

# change the path to the license file in the sample config
$ sed -i 's_/path/to/license-if-using-teleport-enterprise.pem_/var/lib/teleport/license.pem_g' ~/teleport/config/teleport.yaml

# start teleport with mounted license, config and data directories, plus all ports
$ docker run --hostname localhost --name teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/data:/var/lib/teleport \
  -p 3023:3023 -p 3025:3025 -p 3080:3080 \
  (=teleport.latest_ent_docker_image=)
```

### Creating a Teleport user when using Docker quickstart

To create a user inside your Teleport Enterprise container, use `docker exec`.

This example command will create a Teleport user called `testuser` which has the
`access` role. Feel free to change these to suit your needs.

```code
$ docker exec teleport tctl users add --roles=access --logins=root,ec2-user,ubuntu testuser
```

When you run this command, Teleport will output a URL which you must open to complete the user signup process:

```txt
User testuser has been created but requires a password. Share this URL with the user to complete user setup, link is valid for 1h0m0s:
https://localhost:3080/web/invite/4f2718a52ce107568b191f222ba069f7

NOTE: Make sure localhost:3080 points at a Teleport proxy which users can access.
```

You can now [follow this guide from "Adding Users"](#adding-users) onwards to create your user and log into Teleport Enterprise.

## Troubleshooting

If Teleport services do not start, take a look at the syslog:

```code
$ sudo journalctl -fu teleport
```

Usually the error will be reported there. Common reasons for failure are:

- Mismatched tokens, i.e. "auth_token" on the node does not match "tokens/node" value on the auth server.
- Network issues: port `3025` is closed via iptables.
- Network issues: ports `3025` or `3022` are occupied by another process.
- Disk issues: Teleport fails to create `/var/lib/teleport` because the volume is read-only or not accessible.
