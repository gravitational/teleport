This section will give an overview of Teleport Enterprise, the commercial product built around
 Teleport Open Source core. For those that want to jump right in, you can play
with the [Getting Started Guide for Teleport Enterprise](getting-started.mdx).

The table below gives a quick overview of the benefits of Teleport Enterprise.

| Teleport Enterprise Feature | Description |
| - | - |
| [Single Sign-On (SSO)](#sso) | Allows Teleport to integrate with existing enterprise identity systems. Examples include Active Directory, Github, Google Apps and numerous identity middleware solutions like Auth0, Okta, and so on. Teleport supports SAML and OAuth/OpenID Connect protocols to interact with them. |
| [Access Requests](workflow/index.mdx) | User interface for teams to create and review requests to access infrastructure with escalated privileges. |
| [FedRAMP/FIPS](#fedrampfips) | Access controls to meet the requirements in a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP). This includes a FIPS 140-2 friendly build of Teleport Enterprise as well as a variety of improvements to aid in complying with security controls even in FedRAMP High environments. |
| Commercial Support | Support SLA with guaranteed response times. |

## SSO

The commercial edition of Teleport allows users to retrieve their SSH
credentials via a single sign-on (SSO) system used by the rest of the organization.

Examples of supported SSO systems include commercial solutions like Okta,
Auth0, SailPoint, OneLogin Active Directory, as well as open source products like Keycloak.
Other identity management systems are supported as long as they provide an
SSO mechanism based on either SAML or OpenID Connect.

### How does SSO work with SSH?

From the user's perspective they need to execute the following command to retrieve their SSH certificate.

```code
$ tsh login
```

Teleport can be configured with a certificate TTL to determine how often a user needs to log in.

`tsh login` will print a URL into the console, which will open an SSO login
prompt, along with the 2FA, as enforced by the SSO provider. If a user supplies
valid credentials, Teleport will issue an SSH certificate.

Moreover, SSO can be used in combination with role-based access control (RBAC)
to enforce SSH access policies like *"developers must not touch production data"*.
See the [SSO](sso.mdx) chapter for more details.

## FedRAMP/FIPS

With Teleport we have built the foundation to meet FedRAMP requirements for the purposes of accessing infrastructure. This includes support for [FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS\_140-2), also known as the Federal Information Processing Standard, which is the US government approved standard for cryptographic modules.

Enterprise customers can download the custom FIPS package from the [Gravitational Dashboard](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/).
Look for `Linux 64-bit (FedRAMP/FIPS)`.

Using `teleport start --fips` Teleport will start in FIPS mode, Teleport will
configure the TLS and SSH servers with FIPS compliant cryptographic algorithms.
In FIPS mode, if non-compliant algorithms are chosen, Teleport will fail to start.
In addition, Teleport checks if the binary was compiled against an approved
cryptographic module (BoringCrypto) and fails to start if it was not.

See our [FedRAMP for SSH and Kubernetes](fedramp.mdx) guide for more infromation.

## Access Requests

With Teleport we've introduced the ability for users to request additional roles. The Access Request API makes it easy to dynamically approve or deny these requests.

See [Access Requests Guide for more information](workflow/index.mdx)

## License file

Commercial Teleport subscriptions require a valid license. See [Enterprise License File](./license.mdx) for how to manage the file in your Teleport Enterprise deployment.
