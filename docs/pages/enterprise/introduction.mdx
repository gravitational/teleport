This section will give an overview of Teleport Enterprise, the commercial product built around
the Teleport Open Source Edition core. For those that want to jump right in, start
with the [Quick Start Guide for Teleport Enterprise](quickstart-enterprise.mdx).

The table below summarizes the benefits of the Teleport Enterprise Edition.

| Teleport Enterprise Feature | Description |
| - | - |
| [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](#role-based-access-control) | Allows Teleport administrators to define User Roles and restrict each role to specific actions. RBAC also allows administrators to partition cluster nodes into groups with different access permissions. |
| [Single Sign-On (SSO)](#single-sign-on) | Allows Teleport to integrate with existing enterprise identity systems. Examples include Active Directory, Github, Google Apps, and numerous identity middleware solutions like Auth0, Okta, and so on. Teleport supports SAML and OAuth/OpenID Connect protocols to interact with them. |
| [Approval Plugins](workflow/index.mdx) | Plugins to approve or deny escalated RBAC requests. |
| [FedRAMP/FIPS](#fedrampfips) | With Teleport 4.0, we have built out the foundation to help Teleport Enterprise customers build and meet the requirements in a FedRAMP System Security Plan (SSP). This includes a FIPS 140-2 friendly build of Teleport Enterprise as well as a variety of improvements to aid in complying with security controls even in FedRAMP High environments. |
| Commercial Support | In addition to these features, Teleport Enterprise also comes with a premium support SLA with guaranteed response times. |

## Role-Based Access Control

RBAC allows Teleport administrators to grant granular access permissions to users following the security best practice that: *users should be given access only what their role requires*.

A typical scenario where RBAC is used might limit roles in the following way: 

1. *admins* can do anything
2. *developers* must never touch production servers
3. *interns* can only SSH into staging servers as guests

Each role is defined by specific permissions and limits on access. 

### How does it work?

Every user in Teleport is **always** assigned a set of roles. The open-source Teleport Comunity Edition 
automatically assigns every user to the built-in `admin`
role. Teleport Enterprise allows administrators to define their roles with far greater control over user permissions.

For example, let's assume a company is using Active Directory to authenticate users and place
them into groups. A typical enterprise deployment of Teleport in this scenario
would comprise:

1. Teleport configured to use existing user identities stored in Active
   Directory.
2. Active Directory users placed in certain groups or claims like `interns`,
   `developers`, `admins`, `contractors`, etc.
3. The Teleport administrator will have to define Teleport *Roles*. For
   example: `users`, `developers`, and `admins`.
4. The last step will be to define mappings from the Active Directory groups (claims)
   to the Teleport Roles so every Teleport user will be assigned a role based on group membership.

## Single Sign-On

The Enterprise Edition of Teleport allows users to retrieve their SSH
credentials via a [SSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on) system used by the rest of the organization.

Examples of supported SSO systems include:

1. Commercial solutions like [Okta](https://www.okta.com), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [SailPoint](https://www.sailpoint.com/), [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) or [Active Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services)
2. Open source products like [Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org).
3. Other identity management systems are supported as long as they provide an
SSO mechanism based on either [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)
or [OAuth2/OpenID Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect).

### How does SSO work with SSH?

A user will only need to execute the following command to retrieve their SSH certificate.

```bash
$ tsh login
```

Teleport can be configured with a certificate TTL to determine how often a user needs to log in.

The command `tsh login` will print a URL into the console, which will open an SSO login
prompt, along with the 2FA, as enforced by the SSO provider. If a user supplies
valid credentials, Teleport will issue an SSH certificate.

Moreover, SSO can be used in combination with RBAC to enforce SSH access policies like *developers must not touch production data*.

## FedRAMP/FIPS

With Teleport 4.0 we have built the foundation to meet FedRAMP requirements for
the purposes of accessing infrastructure. 

This includes support for [FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS\_140-2),
also known as the Federal Information Processing Standard, the US
government-approved standard for cryptographic modules.

Enterprise customers can download the custom FIPS package from the [Gravitational Dashboard](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/).

Look for `Linux 64-bit (FedRAMP/FIPS)`.

Using `teleport start --fips` Teleport will start in FIPS mode, Teleport will
configure the TLS and SSH servers with FIPS-compliant cryptographic algorithms.

In FIPS mode, if non-compliant algorithms are chosen, Teleport will fail to start.

Teleport also checks if the binary was compiled against an approved
cryptographic module (BoringCrypto) and fails to start if it was not.

See our [FedRAMP for SSH and Kubernetes](ssh-kubernetes-fedramp.mdx) guide for more infromation.

## Access Requests

With Teleport 4.2 we've introduced the ability for users to request additional roles. The Access Requests API makes it easy to dynamically approve or deny these requests.
