title: Desktop Access with Active Directory (Manual)
description: Manually connect Teleport to an Active Directory domain.
videoBanner: YvMqgcq0MTQ
---

This guide demonstrates how to connect an Active Directory domain to Teleport using the
Desktop Service and log into a Windows desktop from that domain.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Use The Wizard">

Starting with Teleport 10.2.6, you can install Active Directory and configure
the Teleport Desktop Service through the Teleport Web UI. See [Desktop Access with Active
Directory](active-directory.mdx) for more information.

Teleport Enterprise users can configure Windows Access for local users by
following [Getting Started with Windows Access](getting-started.mdx).

Continue with this guide if:

- You're running an older version of Teleport and can't upgrade.
- You want to install the Desktop Service using the same instance of `teleport`
  running the Proxy/Auth Services.

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

This guide requires you to have:

- An Active Directory domain, configured for LDAPS (Teleport requires an
  encrypted LDAP connection). Typically this means installing
  [AD CS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-cs/)

<Admonition title="Azure AD" type="warning">

Microsoft's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) offering does not support the
Kerberos authentication protocol, which is required for the certificate-based 
authentication described in this section.

At this time, Teleport does not support integration with Azure AD, however
Teleport Enterprise customers can access Windows desktops (including those
joined to Azure AD) using local accounts via the process described in [Getting
Started with Desktop Access](./getting-started.mdx).
</Admonition>

- Access to a Domain Controller

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux server to run the Teleport Desktop Service on.

  You can reuse an existing server running any other Teleport instance.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/7. Create a restrictive service account

Teleport requires a service account to connect to your Active Directory domain.
We recommend creating a dedicated service account with restrictive permissions
for maximum security.

To create the service account, open a PowerShell prompt and copy-paste in the
commands below. A password for this service account will be randomly generated,
but immediately discarded. Teleport does not need this password, as it uses x509
certificates for LDAP authentication. You can reset the password for this
account should you need to perform password authentication.

```powershell
$Name="Teleport Service Account"
$SamAccountName="svc-teleport"

# Generate a random password that meets the "Password must meet complexity
# requirements" security policy setting.
# Note: if the minimum complexity requirements have been changed from the
# Windows default, this part of the script may need to be modified.
Add-Type -AssemblyName 'System.Web'
do {
   $Password=[System.Web.Security.Membership]::GeneratePassword(15,1)
} until ($Password -match '\d')
$SecureStringPassword=ConvertTo-SecureString $Password -AsPlainText -Force

New-ADUser `
  -Name $Name `
  -SamAccountName $SamAccountName `
  -AccountPassword $SecureStringPassword `
  -Enabled $true
```

Next, in the same PowerShell prompt, enter the following commands to limit your
service account's permissions.

```powershell
# Save your domain's distinguished name to a variable.
$DomainDN=$((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)

# Create the CDP/Teleport container.
# If the command fails with "New-ADObject : An attempt was made to add an object
# to the directory with a name that is already in use", it means the object
# already exists and you can move on to the next step.
New-ADObject -Name "Teleport" -Type "container" -Path "CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN"

# Gives Teleport the ability to create LDAP containers in the CDP container.
dsacls "CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):CC;container;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to create and delete cRLDistributionPoint objects in the CDP/Teleport container.
dsacls "CN=Teleport,CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):CCDC;cRLDistributionPoint;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to write the certificateRevocationList property in the CDP/Teleport container.
dsacls "CN=Teleport,CN=CDP,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN " /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):WP;certificateRevocationList;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to create and delete certificationAuthority objects in the NTAuthCertificates container.
dsacls "CN=NTAuthCertificates,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):CCDC;certificationAuthority;"
# Gives Teleport the ability to write the cACertificate property in the NTAuthCertificates container.
dsacls "CN=NTAuthCertificates,CN=Public Key Services,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,$DomainDN" /I:T /G "$($SamAccountName):WP;cACertificate;"

```

To save yourself time later, you can use the same prompt to get the security
identifier of your new service account by running this command:

```powershell
Get-AdUser -Identity $SamAccountName | Select SID
```

Note this value (beginning with "S-") down, as it will be used as the `sid` field
in the `ldap` section of your configuration file in a later step.

## Step 2/7. Prevent the service account from performing interactive logins

<Admonition type="note" title="gpupdate.exe">
  Throughout this step and the next one, you will be modifying GPOs, and
  sometimes GPO modifications can take some time to propagate to all hosts. You
  can force your changes to take effect immediately on your current host at any
  time by opening a PowerShell prompt and running `gpupdate.exe /force` (though
  their effects may still take time to propagate to other machines on the
  domain).
</Admonition>

The Teleport service account is only needed to authenticate over LDAP, meaning
that it needn't be able to log in to Windows machines like an ordinary user.
Restrict it from doing so by creating a new Group Policy Object (GPO) linked to
your entire domain, and then deny it interactive login.

### Create a GPO

1. Open a PowerShell prompt and change the `$GPOName` variable below to your
   desired GPO name, or leave the recommended name:

```powershell
$GPOName="Block teleport-svc Interactive Login"
```

1. Create the new GPO by running (from the same prompt):

```powershell
New-GPO -Name $GPOName | New-GPLink -Target $((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)
```

### Deny interactive login

1. Open the program named `Group Policy Management` and find the GPO you just
   created
   (`$FOREST > Domains > $DOMAIN > Group Policy Objects > Block teleport-svc Interactive Login`),
   right-click on it and select `Edit...` from the context menu.

1. Select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment
   ```

1. Double click `Deny log on locally` and in the popup, check `Define these policy settings`.

1. Then click `Add User or Group...`, `Browse ...`, enter the SAM account name
   of the user you created above (`svc-teleport`) and hit `Check Names` select
   your Group, and then hit `OK` on all the windows.

1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for `Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services` (in
   lieu of `Deny log on locally`).

</Figure>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Disabling Password Authentication">
  For added security, consider disabling username/password authentication completely via the GPO,
  requiring access via Teleport's virtual smart card.
</Admonition>

## Step 3/7. Configure a GPO to allow Teleport connections

Next, we need to configure a GPO to allow Teleport desktop sessions. This
includes telling your computers to trust Teleport's CA, allowing the
certificate-based smart card authentication, and ensuring RDP is enabled.

### Export the Teleport CA

The following step requires an existing cluster. If you don't already have a
Teleport cluster up and running, see our general [Getting
Started](../index.mdx) guide to set up a demo cluster.

<Admonition type="note" title="User CA Rotation">
These steps will need to be repeated if Teleport's user certificate authority is rotated.
</Admonition>

Get the Teleport user CA certificate by running the following in the Windows
machine where you can manage your group policy, assigning <Var name="proxy" />
to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```code
$ curl -o user-ca.cer https://<Var name="proxy"/>/webapi/auth/export?type=windows
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Take note of the location">
Take note of the path to the `user-ca.cer` file, as you will need this in the next step.
</Admonition>

### Create another GPO and import the Teleport CA

<Admonition type="note" title="Domain Wide Policy">
For the purposes of this guide, we apply the GPO we are about to create to our
entire AD domain. In the case where you wish for only a subset of computers
within your AD domain to be accessible via Teleport, you should apply the GPO
to an OU that includes only such computers.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Differences when using AWS Managed Active Directory">
When using AWS Managed Active Directory, AWS Delegated Domain Administrator accounts are not granted permissions
to apply GPOs at the domain level.

Instead, you should apply this GPO to the automatically-created OU with the NetBIOS domain name containing `Computers`
and `Users` which is nested one level beneath the domain root.

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="AWS Managed AD OU Location">
![AWS Managed AD OU Location](../../img/desktop-access/aws-managed-ad.png)
</Figure>
</Admonition>

1. Create another new GPO, this time giving it a name like `Teleport Access Policy`:

   ```powershell
   $GPOName="Teleport Access Policy"
   New-GPO -Name $GPOName | New-GPLink -Target $((Get-ADDomain).DistinguishedName)
   ```

1. Open the `Group Policy Management` program, and on the left pane,
   navigate to `$FOREST > Domains > $DOMAIN > Group Policy Objects`.

1. Right click on the GPO you just made (`Teleport Access Policy`), and select `Edit...`.

1. In the group policy editor, select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Public Key Policies
   ```

1. Right click on `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` and select `Import`.

1. Click through the wizard, selecting your CA file.

   <Figure align="left" bordered caption="Import Teleport CA">
   ![Import Teleport CA](../../img/desktop-access/ca.png)
   </Figure>

### Publish the Teleport CA to the Active Directory domain

<Admonition type="note" title="Differences when using AWS Managed Active Directory">
When using AWS Managed Active Directory, you should run this command using an
account which is part of the `AWS Delegated Domain Administrators` group, such
as the AWS-provided `admin` account.
</Admonition>

On a machine which is joined to your domain and logged in as an account in the
`Domain Administrators` group, run the two commands below at a PowerShell prompt
to publish the Teleport CA to your Active Directory domain (using the path to
the exported Teleport `user-ca.cer` file that you copied above):

```powershell
certutil –dspublish –f <PathToCertFile.cer> RootCA
```

This step enables the domain controllers to trust the Teleport CA, which will
allow smart card logons via Teleport to succeed.

### Publish the Teleport CA to the NTAuth Store

In order for authentication with Teleport-issued certificates to succeed, the
Teleport CA needs to be published to the enterprise NTAuth store. Teleport will
periodically publish its CA after it is able to authenticate, but this step
needs to be performed manually the first time in order for Teleport to have LDAP
access.

1. Publish the CA to LDAP:

   ```powershell
   certutil –dspublish –f <PathToCertFile.cer> NTAuthCA
   ```

1. Force the retrieval of the CA from LDAP. While this step is not required, it
   speeds up the process and allows you to proceed to the next steps without
   waiting for the certificate to propagate.

   ```powershell
   certutil -pulse
   ```

### Enable the Smart Card service

Teleport performs certificate based authentication by emulating a smart card.

1. Still editing your `Teleport Access Policy`, select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > System Services
   ```

1. Double click on `Smart Card`, select `Define this policy setting` and switch
   to `Automatic` then click `OK`.

   <Figure align="left" bordered caption="Enable the Smart Card Service">
   ![Enable Smartcard](../../img/desktop-access/smartcard.png)
   </Figure>

### Allow remote RDP connections

1. Next, select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Connections
   ```

1. Right click on `Allow users to connect remotely by using Remote Desktop Services` and select `Edit`. Select `Enabled` and `OK`.

1. Select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security
   ```

1. Right click `Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authentication`, edit, select `Disable` and `OK`.

   <Figure align="left" bordered caption="Disable Require user authentication...">
   ![Disable Require](../../img/desktop-access/disable.png)
   </Figure>

1. Right click `Always prompt for password upon connection`, edit, select **`Disabled`** and .
   Teleport's smart card based authentication generates a random smart card PIN for each
   desktop session and provides the PIN to the desktop during the RDP connection establishment.
   Since the PIN is never provided to the Teleport user, this setting must be disabled in
   order for authentication to complete.

### Allow credentials to be provided over RDP

Select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security > "Always prompt for password upon connection"
```

Set to `Disabled` and click `OK`.

### Open firewall to inbound RDP connections

1. Select:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Windows Firewall with Advanced Security (x2)
   ```

1. Right click on `Inbound Rules` and select `New Rule...`.

1. Under `Predefined` select `Remote Desktop`.

1. Only select the rule for `User Mode (TCP-in)`.

1. On the next screen, select `Allow the connection` and finish.

   <Figure align="left" bordered caption="Open the Firewall">
   ![Open the Firewall](../../img/desktop-access/firewall.png)
   </Figure>

### Ensure your GPO is updated

If you have not done so already, ensure your GPO is updated by opening a
PowerShell prompt and running:

```powershell
gpupdate.exe /force
```

## Step 4/7. Configure a certificate for RDP connections

<Admonition type="note" title="Secure Cipher Suites">
Teleport's RDP client supports only secure algorithms for making TLS connections,
so we have to configure our Domain Controller to support those cipher suites as well.
This step is only *necessary* for Windows Server 2012 R2 as it does not support
secure algorithms by default. If it does not apply to you, you can skip this step
and go to the [next step](#step-57-export-your-ldap-ca-certificate).
</Admonition>

In this step we'll create a new certificate template that uses elliptic curve
cryptography, and then configure our GPO to use the newly created template to
issue certificates used for Remote Desktop connections.

### Create a certificate template

In this section, we will create a certificate template that uses elliptic curve
P-384 and uses SHA384 as the signature algorithm.

1. Open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC)

   ```text
   Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Certificate Authority
   ```

1. Open your CA computer and right-click on `Certificate Templates`, then select `Manage`.

1. Find the `Computer` template on the list, right-click on it, then select `Duplicate Template`.

1. In the `Compatibility` tab change `Certification Authority` to `Windows Server 2012 R2` and click `OK`.

1. In the same tab change `Certificate recipient` to `Windows Server 2012 R2` and click `OK`.

1. Go to the `General` tab and change `Template display name` to `RemoteDesktopAccess`.
   Make sure `Template name` is also `RemoteDesktopAccess`.

1. In the `Cryptography` tab change `Provider Category` to `Key Storage Provider`,
   then `Algorithm name` to `ECDH_P384`. Also, change `Request hash` to `SHA384`.

1. In the `Extensions` tab select `Application Polices` and click the `Edit` button.

1. Remove all entries from the list.

1. Go to the `Security` tab, select `Domain Computers` and give the group `Read` and `Enroll` permissions.

1. Finally, create a template by clicking `OK`.

1. Go back to the Certificate Authority window and right-click on `Certificate Templates`. Then:

   ```text
   New > Certificate Template to Issue
   ```

1. Select `RemoteDesktopAccess` and click `OK`.

### Update GPO to use a new certificate template

In the group policy editor for `Teleport Access Policy`, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security
```

Right-click on `Server authentication certificate template`, `Edit`, then select
`Enabled` and fill `Certificate Template Name` with `RemoteDesktopAccess`.

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="RDP Certificate Template">
![RDP Certificate Template](../../img/desktop-access/rdp-certificate-template.png)
</Figure>

### Configure server certificate auto-enrollment

In the group policy editor for `Teleport Access Policy`, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Public Key Policies
```

Double-click on `Certificate Services Client - Auto-Enrollment`, then select
`Enabled` in the `Configuration Model`.

### Ensure your GPO is updated

If you have not done so already, ensure your GPO is updated by opening a
PowerShell prompt and running:

```powershell
gpupdate.exe /force
```

## Step 5/7. Export your LDAP CA certificate

Teleport connects to your Domain Controller via LDAPS. This means that you must
let Teleport know that the certificate sent by your Domain Controller during the
initial SSL connection is trusted. If your Domain Controller's certificate is
trusted by the system repository on the system running Teleport, you can skip
this step.

<Details title="Skipping TLS Verification">
If you are unable to acquire the LDAP CA certificate, you can skip
TLS verification by setting `insecure_skip_verify: true`. We do not recommend
skipping TLS verification in production environments.
</Details>

### To export a CA certificate

{/* Adapted from https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/rds/5.2.1?topic=security-exporting-certificate-from-active-directory-server */}

1. Begin by navigating to `Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > CertificateAuthority`
   to open the CA Microsoft Management Console (MMC) GUI.
1. Right click on your CA computer and select `Properties`.
1. From `General` tab, click `View Certificate`.
1. Select the `Details` view and click `Copy to File`.
1. Click `Next` in the Certificate Export Wizard, and ensure that `DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)`
   is selected
1. Select a name and location for you certificate and click through the wizard.

Now transfer the exported file to the system where you're running Teleport. You
can either add this certificate to your system's trusted repository or provide
the filepath to the `der_ca_file` configuration variable.

## Step 6/7. Configure Teleport

<Admonition type="note" title="Teleport CA">
Prior to v8.0, the Teleport CA was not compatible with Windows logins. If
you're setting up the Desktop Service in an existing cluster created before v8.0,
you must first perform a [CA rotation](../management/operations/ca-rotation.mdx) in
order to resolve this.
</Admonition>

Install Teleport on the host where you will run the Teleport Desktop Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

In order to enable desktop access in Teleport, add the following section in
`/etc/teleport.yaml` on your Linux server. For a detailed description of these
configuration fields, see the
[configuration reference](./reference/configuration.mdx) page.

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss","enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">
The Teleport Windows Desktop Service will establish a reverse tunnel to
the Proxy Service. This requires setting `proxy_server` to your Proxy Service
address and providing a join token.

First, generate a join token with the following command:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=windowsdesktop
```

Copy the join token to a file on the instance where you will run the Windows Desktop
Service, and then use the following configuration:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  auth_token: /path/to/token
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com # replace with your proxy address
windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  ldap:
    # Port must be included for the addr.
    # LDAPS port is 636 by default,
    # e.g. example.com:636
    addr: "$LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS"
    domain: "$LDAP_DOMAIN_NAME"
    username: "$LDAP_USERNAME"
    sid: "$LDAP_USER_SID"
    # This should be the path to the certificate exported in Step 4.
    der_ca_file: /path/to/cert
  discovery:
    base_dn: "*"
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
ssh_service:
  enabled: no
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud","team"]} label="Cloud-Hosted">

For Teleport Team and Teleport Enterprise Cloud, the Windows Desktop Service
should establish a reverse tunnel to the hosted Teleport Proxy Service. This
requires setting `proxy_server` to your cloud tenant and providing a join token.

First, generate a join token with the following command:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=windowsdesktop
```

Copy the join token to a file on the instance where you will run Windows Desktop
Service, and then use the following configuration:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  auth_token: /path/to/token
  proxy_server: mytenant.teleport.sh # replace with your cloud tenant
windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  ldap:
    # Port must be included for the addr.
    # LDAPS port is 636 by default,
    # e.g. example.com:636
    addr: "$LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS"
    domain: "$LDAP_DOMAIN_NAME"
    username: "$LDAP_USERNAME"
    sid: "$LDAP_USER_SID"
    # This should be the path to the certificate exported in Step 5.
    der_ca_file: /path/to/cert
  discovery:
    base_dn: "*"
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
ssh_service:
  enabled: no
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport Desktop Service"!)

## Step 7/7. Log in using Teleport

### Create a Teleport user/role for Windows Desktop Access

In order to gain access to a remote desktop, a Teleport user needs to have the
appropriate permissions for that desktop.

For example, you can create a role that gives its users access to all Windows
desktop labels and the `"Administrator"` user. To do so, create a file called
`windows-desktop-admins.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: windows-desktop-admins
spec:
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      "*": "*"
    windows_desktop_logins: ["jsmith"]
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="RBAC Configuration">
Ensure that each Teleport user is only assigned Windows logins that they should
be allowed to access.

Usernames shared between domain and local users will create login conflicts.
</Admonition>

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f windows-desktop-admins.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="windows-desktop-admins"!)

### Connect to your Windows desktop

At this point everything is ready for Desktop Service connections. Open
the Teleport web UI and log in with a user with the role created above.

On the left pane, select `Desktops (preview)`. You should see the list of all
computers and Domain Controllers connected to your domain. Select one and click
`CONNECT` on the right, selecting one of the available logins:

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Select Desktop">
![Select Desktop](../../img/desktop-access/select-desktop.png)
</Figure>

A new tab will open and, after a few seconds, you should be logged in to your
target Windows host.

## Security hardening

By default, the Default Domain Policy grants the "Add workstations to domain
user" right to all authenticated users. As a security best practice, Teleport
recommends that this level of access is only granted to administrators or other
privileged groups.

To make this change, open the Group Policy Management Console, navigate to
`$FOREST > Domains > $DOMAIN > Group Policy Objects`, right-click on Default
Domain Controller Policy and select Edit.

In the Group Policy Editor, navigate to

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment
```

Double click the "Add workstations to domain" policy and ensure that the
"Authenticated Users" group is not present.

## Troubleshooting

If you hit any issues, check out the
[Troubleshooting documentation](./troubleshooting.mdx) for common problems and
solutions.
