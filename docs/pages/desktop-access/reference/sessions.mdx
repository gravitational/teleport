description: Recording and Playing Back Teleport Desktop Access Sessions.
---

Teleport Desktop Access supports recording and playback of desktop sessions.
Session recording is enabled by default, and can be disabled in one of two ways:

## Disable session recording at the cluster level

To disable session recording at the cluster level, edit your `teleport.yaml`
configuration file.

```yaml
teleport:
  auth_service:
    session_recording: off
```

<Admonition type="warning">
Disabling session recording at the cluster level applies to all types of
recordings. For example, this configuration would prevent Teleport from
recording SSH sessions as well as desktop sessions.
</Admonition>

The `session_recording` property can also be configured dynamically by using
`tctl` to edit the cluster's `session_recording_config` resource. This is the
required approach for Teleport Cloud users.

## Disable session recording via RBAC

Teleport's RBAC system allows more fine-grained control over which sessions are
recorded. By default, desktop session recording is enabled. To disable desktop
session recording for a particular user, add the following role option to all of
the user's roles:

```yaml
record_sessions:
  desktop: false
```

Because recording can be important for auditing and compliance concerns, the
presence of a single role with recording enabled will result in the session
being recorded. In other words, _all_ of the roles applied to a user must
explicitly disable recording to prevent the session from being recorded.

# Recording

When a desktop session is active, Teleport will indicate whether the session is
being recorded in the menu bar at the top of the screen.

{
    /* screenshots for recording, not recording */
}

# Playback

Recorded sessions can be viewed in the *Session Recordings* page. Desktop
recordings show a desktop icon in the first column to distinguish them from
SSH recordings.

{
    /* screenshot of recordings table */
}

<Adminition type="note" title="RBAC for sessions">
Since Teleport 8.1, sessions can be protected via RBAC. In order for a user to
see desktop sessions in this list, their roles must permit access to the
sessions resource.

</Admonition>

Click the play button to open the player in a new tab. The desktop session
player supports toggling between play and pause, but does not support seeking to
a specific point in the stream, rewinding, or restarting playback when the end
of the stream is reached.
