# Getting Started

In this guide we will connect an Active Directory domain to Teleport using
Desktop Access and log into a Windows desktop from that domain.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires you to have:

- An Active Directory domain, configured for LDAPS (Teleport requires an encrypted LDAP connection)
- Access to a Domain Controller
- LDAP credentials for Active Directory (usually the same credentials you use
  to log into the Domain Controller)
- An existing Teleport cluster and user, version 8.0 or newer
  - see [Teleport Getting Started](../getting-started.mdx) if you're new to Teleport
- A Linux server to run the Teleport Desktop Access service on
  - you can reuse an existing server running any other Teleport instance

## Step 1/3. Configure Teleport

  Prior to v8.0, the Teleport CA was not compatible with Windows logins. If
  you're setting up Desktop Access in an existing cluster created before v8.0,
  you must first perform a [CA rotation](../setup/operations/ca-rotation.mdx)
  in order to resolve this.
</Admonition>

First, we need to enable Desktop Access in Teleport. To do this, add the
following section in `teleport.yaml` on your Linux server:

```yaml
windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  # This is the address that windows_desktop_service will listen on.
  listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:3028"
  # (optional) This is the address that windows_desktop_service will advertise
  # to the rest of Teleport for incoming connections. Only proxy_service should
  # connect to windows_desktop_service, users connect to the proxy's web UI
  # instead.
  public_addr: "desktop-access.example.com:3028"
  ldap:
    # Address of the Domain Controller for LDAP connections. Usually, this
    # address will use port 389, like: domain-controller.example.com:389.
    addr:     '$LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS'
    # Active Directory domain name you are connecting to.
    domain:   '$LDAP_DOMAIN_NAME'
    # LDAP username for authentication. This username must include the domain
    # NetBIOS name.
    #
    # For example, if your domain is "example.com", the NetBIOS name for it is
    # likely "EXAMPLE". When connecting as the "Administrator" user, you should
    # use the format: "EXAMPLE\Administrator".
    username: '$LDAP_USERNAME'
    # Plain text file containing the LDAP password for authentication.
    # This is usually the same password you use to login to the Domain Controller.
    password_file: /var/lib/ldap-pass
```

After updating `teleport.yaml`, start Teleport as usual using `teleport start`.

## Step 2/3. Configure Group Policy to allow Teleport connections

{/* TODO: script this using PowerShell */}

Next, we need to configure Active Directory to trust Teleport for user
authentication and allow the certificate-based mechanism that Teleport uses under the hood
(smart cards).

Get the Teleport user CA certificate:

```
$ tctl auth export --type=windows > user-ca.cer
```

Transfer the `user-ca.cer` file to your Domain Controller.

Log into your Domain Controller open "Start" menu and run "Group Policy
Management". On the left pane, navigate to `$FOREST > Domains > $DOMAIN`,
selecting your forest and domain names respectively. Right click on "Default
Domain Policy" and select "Edit...".

### Import Teleport CA

In the group policy editor, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Public Key Policies
```

Right click on `Trusted Root Certification Authorities` and select `Import`.
Click through the wizard, selecting your CA file.

### Allow remote RDP connections

Next, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Connections
```

Right click on `Allow users to connect remotely by using Remote Desktop
Services` and select "Edit". Select "Enable" and "OK".

<Figure align="left" bordered caption="Enable Remote Desktop Services">
  ![Enable RDP](../../img/desktop-access/rdp.png)
</Figure>


Select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Remote Desktop Services > Remote Desktop Session Host > Security
```

Right click `Require user authentication for remote connections by using
Network Level Authentication`, edit, select **"Disable"** and "OK".

### Enable the Smart Card service

Teleport performs certificate based authentication by emulating a smart card.
To enable the smart card service, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > System Services
```

Double click on `Smart Card`, select `Define this policy setting` and switch to
`Automatic`. Click "OK".

### Open firewall to inbound RDP connections

Finally, select:

```text
Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Windows Firewall and Advanced Security
```

Right click on `Inbound Rules` and select `New Rule...`. Under `Predefined`
select `Remote Desktop`. Only select the rule for `User Mode (TCP-in)`. On the
next screen, select `Allow the connection` and finish.

## Step 3/3. Log in using Teleport

{/* TODO: add screenshots */}

At this point everything should be ready for Desktop Access connections. Open
the Teleport web UI and log in.

On the left pane, select `Desktops`. You should see the list of all computers
and Domain Controllers connected to your domain. Select one and click `CONNECT`
on the right.

A new tab will open and, after a few seconds, you should be logged in to your
target Windows host.
