The Teleport Web UI is a web-based visual interface from which you can access resources,
view active sessions and recordings, create and review Access Requests,
manage users and roles, and more.

This page serves a reference on Web UI features and their usage.

## Joining an active session

The Teleport Web UI allows you to list and join active SSH sessions using a web-based terminal.

You can view the active SSH sessions that you are allowed to list by clicking **Active Sessions** in the navigation sidebar.

From the active sessions list, click **Join** and select a participant mode to join the session:

- **As an Observer** with read-only access to the session. You can view output but cannot control the session in any way nor
  send any input.
- **As a Peer** to collaborate in the session. You can view output and send input.
- **As a Moderator** with permission to watch, pause, or terminate the session. You can view output and forcefully terminate
  or pause the session at any time, but can't send input. Moderated sessions are an enterprise-only feature.

You must have the `join_sessions` allow policy in a role you've been assigned to join sessions in any participant mode.
For information about how to configure the `join_sessions` allow policy and participant modes for a role, see
[Configure an allow policy](../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/joining-sessions.mdx).

## Idle timeout

After you log in, the Teleport Web UI checks every 30 seconds if your session is inactive. If so, it
logs you out. A session is considered inactive if more than 10 minutes have passed since you last
interacted with any Web UI browser tab, either through keyboard input or mouse movement and clicks.

To change the default idle timeout of 10 minutes, ask your cluster admin to adjust the
`web_idle_timeout` setting in the Auth Service configuration.

Use `tctl` to edit the `cluster_networking_config` value:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_networking_config
```

Change the value of `spec.web_idle_timeout`:

```yaml
kind: cluster_networking_config
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  web_idle_timeout: 10m0s
  ...
version: v2
```

After you save and exit the editor, `tctl` will update the resource:

```text
cluster networking configuration has been updated
```
