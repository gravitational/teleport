description: Using the Teleport Web UI

The Teleport Web UI is a web-based visual interface from which you can access resources, 
view active sessions and recordings, create and review Access Requests, 
manage users and roles, and more.

This page serves a reference on Web UI features and their usage.

## Joining an active session

The Teleport Web UI allows you to list and join active SSH sessions using a web-based terminal.

You can view the active SSH sessions that you are allowed to list by clicking **Active Sessions** in the navigation sidebar. 
You can only see active sessions if you are assigned a role with `list` access for the `ssh_session` resource. 
For more information about role permissions and access to resources, see [Teleport Access Controls 
Reference](../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).

From the active sessions list, click **Join** and select a participant mode to join the session: 

- **As an Observer** with read-only access to the session. You can view output but cannot control the session in any way nor 
  send any input.
- **As a Moderator** with permission to watch, pause, or terminate the session. You can view output and forcefully terminate 
  or pause the session at any time, but can't send input.
- **As a Peer** to collaborate in the session. You can view output and send input.

You must have the `join_sessions` allow policy in a role you've been assigned to join sessions in any participant mode. 
For information about how to configure the `join_sessions` allow policy and participant modes for a role, see 
[Configure an allow policy](../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx).

## Idle timeout

After you log in, the Teleport Web UI checks every 30 seconds if your session is inactive. If so, it
logs you out. A session is considered inactive if more than 10 minutes have passed since you last
interacted with any Web UI browser tab, either through keyboard input or mouse movement and clicks.

To change the default idle timeout of 10 minutes, ask your cluster admin to adjust the
`web_idle_timeout` setting in the Auth Service configuration.

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["cloud", "team"]} label="Dynamic Resources (All Editions)">

Use `tctl` to edit the `cluster_networking_config` value:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_networking_config
```

Change the value of `spec.web_idle_timeout`:

```yaml
kind: cluster_networking_config
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  web_idle_timeout: 10m0s
  ...
version: v2
```

After you save and exit the editor, `tctl` will update the resource:

```text
cluster networking configuration has been updated
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Static Config (Self-Hosted)" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

Update `/etc/teleport.yaml` in the `auth_service` section and restart the `teleport` daemon.

```yaml
auth_service:
  web_idle_timeout: 10m0s
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
