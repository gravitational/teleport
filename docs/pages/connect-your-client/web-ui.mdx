The Teleport Web UI is a web-based visual interface from which you can access resources, 
view active sessions and recordings, create and review Access Requests, 
manage users and roles, and more.

This page serves a reference on Web UI features and their usage.

## Joining an active session

The Web UI allows you to list and join active SSH sessions via a web-based terminal.

Any active SSH sessions that you are allowed to list will be listed on the "Active Sessions" page, which can be 
accessed from the navigation bar on the left side. If you don't see the "Active Sessions" tab, it means that your user's role doesn't grant
you `list` access for the `ssh_session` resource. Please refer to the [Teleport Access Controls Reference](../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx)
and make sure your role has all the necessary permissions.

Upon clicking on the "Join" button to join an active session, you must choose from one of 3 participant modes to join the session in: 

- `observer`: Allows read-only access to the session. You can view output but cannot control the session in any way nor send any input.
- `moderator`: Allows you to watch the session. You can view output and forcefully terminate or pause the session at any time, but can't send input.
- `peer`: Allows you to collaborate in the session. You can view output and send input.

If the launch button is missing, then you don't have permission to join in any participant mode. 
For more information about the `join_sessions` allow policy, see [Configure an allow 
policy](../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions.mdx).

## Idle timeout

After you log in, the Teleport Web UI checks every 30 seconds if your session is inactive. If so, it
logs you out. A session is considered inactive if more than 10 minutes have passed since you last
interacted with any Web UI browser tab, either through keyboard input or mouse movement and clicks.

To change the default idle timeout of 10 minutes, ask your cluster admin to adjust the
`web_idle_timeout` setting in the Auth Service configuration.

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["cloud", "team"]} label="Dynamic Resources (All Editions)">

Use `tctl` to edit the `cluster_networking_config` value:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_networking_config
```

Change the value of `spec.web_idle_timeout`:

```yaml
kind: cluster_networking_config
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  web_idle_timeout: 10m0s
  ...
version: v2
```

After you save and exit the editor, `tctl` will update the resource:

```text
cluster networking configuration has been updated
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Static Config (Self-Hosted)" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

Update `/etc/teleport.yaml` in the `auth_service` section and restart the `teleport` daemon.

```yaml
auth_service:
  web_idle_timeout: 10m0s
```

</TabItem>
