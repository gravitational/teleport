title: Database Access GUI Clients
description: How to configure graphical database clients for Teleport database access.
---

This guide describes how to configure popular graphical database clients to
work with Teleport.

## Setting up your Teleport environment

### Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- The Teleport Database Service configured to access a database. See one of our
  [guides](../database-access/guides.mdx) for how to set up the Teleport
  Database Service for your database.

### Get connection information

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Authenticated Proxy">
Starting the local database proxy with the `--tunnel` flag will create an
authenticated tunnel that you can use to connect to your database instances.
You won't need to configure any credentials when connecting to this tunnel.

Here is an example on how to start the proxy:

```bash
# Start the local proxy.
$ tsh proxy db --tunnel <database-name>
Started authenticated tunnel for the <engine> database "<database-name>" in cluster "<cluster-name>" on 127.0.0.1:62652.
```

You can optionally specify the database name and the user to use by default
when connecting to the database:

```code
$ tsh proxy db --db-user=my-database-user --db-name=my-schema --tunnel <database-name>
```

Now, you can connect to the address the proxy command returns. In our example it
is `127.0.0.1:62652`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="TLS routing">
If you're using Teleport in [TLS routing](../management/operations/tls-routing.mdx)
mode where each database protocol is multiplexed on the same web proxy port, use
the following command to start a local TLS proxy your GUI database client will
be connecting to:

```code
$ tsh proxy db <database-name>
Started DB proxy on 127.0.0.1:61740

Use following credentials to connect to the <database-name> proxy:
  ca_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/certs.pem
  cert_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice-db/root/<database-name>-x509.pem
  key_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice
```

Use the displayed local proxy host/port and credentials paths when configuring
your GUI client below. When entering the hostname, use `localhost` rather than
`127.0.0.1`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Separate ports">
If you're not using TLS routing, run the following command to see the database
connection information:

```code
# View configuration for the database you're logged in to.
$ tsh db config
# View configuration for the specific database when you're logged into multiple.
$ tsh db config example
```

It will display the path to your locally cached certificate and key files:

```
Name:      example
Host:      teleport.example.com
Port:      3080
User:      postgres
Database:  postgres
CA:        /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/certs.pem
Cert:      /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice-db/root/example-x509.pem
Key:       /Users/alice/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice
```

The displayed `CA`, `Cert`, and `Key` files are used to connect through pgAdmin
4, MySQL Workbench, and other graphical database clients that support mutual
TLS authentication.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope="cloud" label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

Use the following command to start a local TLS proxy your GUI database client
will be connecting to:

```code
$ tsh proxy db <database-name>
Started DB proxy on 127.0.0.1:61740

Use following credentials to connect to the <database-name> proxy:
  ca_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/certs.pem
  cert_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice-db/root/<database-name>-x509.pem
  key_file=/Users/r0mant/.tsh/keys/root.gravitational.io/alice
```

Use the displayed local proxy host/port and credentials paths when configuring
your GUI client below. When entering the hostname, use `localhost` rather than
`127.0.0.1`.

On the "Hostname" tab, enter the hostname and port of the proxy you will use to
access the database (see
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information)).
Leave "Authentication" as None.

![MongoDB Compass hostname](../../img/database-access/compass-hostname@2x.png)

On the "More Options" tab, set SSL to "Client and Server Validation" and set the
CA as well as the client key and certificate. Note that a CA path must be
provided and be able to validate the certificate presented by your Teleport
Proxy Service's web endpoint.

![MongoDB Compass more options](../../img/database-access/compass-more-options@2x.png)

Click on the "Connect" button.

## MySQL DBeaver

Right-click in the "Database Navigator" menu in the main view and select Create > Connection:

![DBeaver Add Server](../../img/database-access/dbeaver-add-server.png)

In the search bar of the "Connect to a database" window that opens up, type "mysql", select the MySQL driver, and click "Next":

![DBeaver Select Driver](../../img/database-access/dbeaver-select-driver.png)

In the newly-opened "Connection Settings" tab, use the Host as `localhost` and
Port as the one returned by the proxy command (`62652` in the example above):

![DBeaver Select Configure Server](../../img/database-access/dbeaver-configure-server.png)

In that same tab, set the username to match the one that you are connecting to
using Teleport and uncheck the "Save password locally" box:

![DBeaver Select Configure User](../../img/database-access/dbeaver-configure-user.png)

Click the "Edit Driver Settings" button on the "Main" tab, check the "No
Authentication" box, and click "Ok" to save:

![DBeaver Driver Settings](../../img/database-access/dbeaver-driver-settings.png)

Once you are back in the "Connection Settings" window, click "Ok" to finish and
DBeaver should connect to the remote MySQL server automatically.

## MySQL Workbench

[MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is a GUI
application that provides comprehensive MySQL administration and SQL development
tools.

In the MySQL Workbench "Setup New Connection" dialog, fill out "Connection
Name", "Hostname", "Port", and "Username":

From the left-side menu select **Operation builder**, then **+ Add connection**.
Choose the **DynamoDB local** tab, and point to your proxy's endpoint. This is
`localhost:62652` in the example above. (See
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information) for
more information.)

![DynamoDB local connection in NoSQL Workbench](../../img/database-access/nosql-workbench-connection.png)

## SQL Server with Azure Data Studio

In Azure Data Studio create a connection using your proxy's endpoint. This is
`localhost,62652` in the example above. On a Windows machine, using an address in
 the format `127.0.0.1,62652` could be required instead of `localhost`. (See
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information) for
more information.)

Create a connection with Microsoft SQL Server with these settings:

|Connection Detail|Value|
|---|---|
|Server|`host`,`port` of proxy endpoint|
|Authentication Type|SQL Login|
|Password|empty|
|Encrypt|`False`|

Example:
![Azure Data Studio connection options](../../img/database-access/azure-data-studio-connection.png)

Click **Connect** to connect.

## PostgreSQL DBeaver

To connect to your PostgreSQL instance, use the authenticated proxy address.
This is `127.0.0.1:62652` in the example above (see the “Authenticated Proxy”
section on [Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information)
for more information).

Use the "Database native" authentication with an empty password:

![DBeaver Postgres Configure
Server](../../img/database-access/dbeaver-pg-configure-server.png)

Clicking on "Test connection" should return a connection success message. Then,
click on "Finish" to save the configuration.

## PostgreSQL pgAdmin 4

[pgAdmin 4](https://www.pgadmin.org/) is a popular graphical client for
PostgreSQL servers.

To configure a new connection, right-click on "Servers" in the main browser view
and create a new server:

![pgAdmin Add Server](../../img/database-access/pgadmin-add-server@2x.png)

In the "General" tab of the new server dialog, enter the server connection name:

![pgAdmin General](../../img/database-access/pgadmin-general@2x.png)

In the "Connection" tab, fill in the hostname, port, user and database name from
the configuration above:

![pgAdmin Connection](../../img/database-access/pgadmin-connection@2x.png)

In the "SSL" tab, set "SSL Mode" to `Verify-Full` and fill in paths for client
certificate, key and root certificate from the configuration above:

![pgAdmin SSL](../../img/database-access/pgadmin-ssl@2x.png)

Click "Save", and pgAdmin should immediately connect. If pgAdmin prompts you
for password, leave the password field empty and click OK.

## Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio connect to a database engine using
your proxy's endpoint. This is `localhost,62652` in the example above. Using
the IP `127.0.0.1,62652` connection could be required on a Windows machine
instead of `localhost`. (See [Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information) for
more information.)

Create a connection with Microsoft SQL Server with these settings:

|Connection Detail|Value|
|---|---|
|Server type|Database Engine|
|Server name|`host`,`port` of proxy endpoint|
|Authentication|SQL Server Authentication|
|Password|empty|
|Encryption|do not enable|

Example:
![Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio connection options](../../img/database-access/msft-sql-server-management-studio-connection.png)
  
Click Connect to connect.

## Redis Insight

<Admonition type="note">
  Teleport's Redis Insight integration only supports Redis standalone instances.
</Admonition>

After opening Redis Insight click `ADD REDIS DATABASE`.

![Redis Insight Startup Screen](../../img/database-access/guides/redis/redisinsight-startup.png)

Now start a local proxy to your Redis instance:

`tsh proxy db --db-user=alice redis-db-name`.

Click `Add Database Manually`. Use `127.0.0.1` as the `Host`. Use the port printed by
the `tsh` command you ran in [Get connection information](#get-connection-information).

Provide your Redis username as `Username` and password as `Password`.

![Redis Insight Configuration](../../img/database-access/guides/redis/redisinsight-add-config.png)

Next, check the `Use TLS` and `Verify TLS Certificates` boxes and copy the CA certificate returned by `tsh proxy db`.
Copy the private key and certificate to corresponding fields.

Click `Add Redis Database`.

![Redis Insight TLS Configuration](../../img/database-access/guides/redis/redisinsight-tls-config.png)

Congratulations! You have just connected to your Redis instance.

![Redis Insight Connected](../../img/database-access/guides/redis/redisinsight-connected.png)

## Snowflake: DBeaver

The Snowflake integration works only in the authenticated proxy mode. Start a local proxy for connections to your Snowflake database by using the command below:
```
tsh proxy db --tunnel --port 2000 snowflake
```

Add a new database by clicking the "add" icon in the top-left corner:

![DBeaver Main Screen](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/dbeaver-main-screen.png)

In the search bar of the "Connect to a database" window that opens up, type "snowflake", select the Snowflake driver, and click "Next":

![DBeaver Select Database](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/dbeaver-select-database.png)

Set "Host" to `localhost` and "Port" to the port returned by the `tsh proxy db` command you ran earlier (`2000` in the example above).
In the "Authentication" section set the "Username" to match the database username passed to Teleport with `--db-user`
and enter any value (e.g., "teleport") in the "Password" field (the value of
 "Password" will be ignored when establishing a connection but is required by DBeaver to register your database):

![DBeaver Main](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/dbeaver-main.png)

Next, click the "Driver properties" tab and set "account" to any value (e.g., "teleport"; as with "Password", the value of
 "account" will be ignored when establishing a connection but is required by DBeaver to register your database). In "User properties", set "ssl" to `off`:

![DBeaver Driver](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/dbeaver-driver.png)

Teleport ignores the provided password and the account name as internally it uses values from the Database Agent configuration.
SSL set to `off` disables only encryption on local machine. Connection to Snowflake is encrypted by Teleport.

Now you can click on "Test Connection..." in the bottom-left corner:

![DBeaver Success](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/dbeaver-success.png)

Congratulations! You have just connected to your Snowflake instance.

## Snowflake: JetBrains (IntelliJ, Goland, DataGrip, PyCharm, etc.)

The Snowflake integration works only in the authenticated proxy mode. Start a local proxy for connections to your Snowflake database by using the command below:
```
tsh proxy db --tunnel --port 2000 snowflake
```

In "Database Explorer" click the "add" button, pick "Data Source", and then pick "Snowflake":

![JetBrains Add Database](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/jetbrains-add-database.png)

Next, set "Host" to `localhost` and "Port" to the port returned by the `tsh proxy db` command you ran earlier (`2000` in the example above).
Set the "Username" to match the one that you are assuming when you connect to Snowflake
 via Teleport and enter any value (e.g., "teleport") in the "Password" field (the value of
 "Password" will be ignored but is required to create a data source in your IDE):

![JetBrains General](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/jetbrains-general.png)

Switch to the "Advanced" tab, set any value (e.g., "teleport") for "account", and add a new record named `ssl` with value `off` (as with "Password", "account" is ignored while establishing the connection but required by your IDE):

![JetBrains Advanced](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/jetbrains-advanced.png)

Teleport ignores the provided password and the account name as internally it uses values from the Database Agent configuration.
Setting "SSL" to `off` only disables encryption on your local machine. The connection to Snowflake is encrypted by Teleport.

Now you can click "Test Connection" to check your configuration.

![JetBrains Success](../../img/database-access/guides/snowflake/jetbrains-success.png)

Congratulations! You have just connected to your Snowflake instance.

## SQL Server DataGrip

In the DataGrip connection configuration menu, use your proxy's endpoint. This
is `localhost:4242` in the example below. (See
[Get connection information](./gui-clients.mdx#get-connection-information) for
more information.)

Select the "User & Password" authentication option and keep the "Password" field
empty:

![DataGrip connection options](../../img/database-access/guides/sqlserver/datagrip-connection@2x.png)

Click "OK" to connect.

## SQL Server DBeaver

In the DBeaver connection configuration menu, use your proxy's endpoint. This is

Use the SQL Server Authentication option and keep the Password field empty:

![DBeaver connection options](../../img/database-access/guides/sqlserver/dbeaver-connection@2x.png)

Click OK to connect.

## Cloud Spanner DataGrip

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/gui-clients/spanner-local-proxy.mdx!)

From the DataGrip menu, click "File > New > Data Source from URL", then copy and
paste the JDBC URL that was output by `tsh proxy db`:

![Create DataGrip Spanner Data Source From JDBC URL](../../img/database-access/spanner-gui/datagrip-data-source-from-jdbc-url@2x.png)

The "Google Cloud Spanner" driver should be automatically selected.
Click "Ok".

DataGrip does not need GCP credentials - those are already provided by Teleport.
On the "General" tab of the new data source, select the "Authentication"
dropdown setting and choose "No auth":

![Choose No Auth For DataGrip Spanner Data Source](../../img/database-access/spanner-gui/datagrip-choose-no-auth@2x.png)

Click "Test connection" to ensure the connection is configured correctly, then
click "Ok" to create the data source.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/gui-clients/spanner-reuse-port-note.mdx!)

## Cloud Spanner DBeaver

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/gui-clients/spanner-local-proxy.mdx!)

From the menu, click "Database > Driver Manager":

![Open DBeaver Driver Manager](../../img/database-access/spanner-gui/dbeaver-open-driver-manager@2x.png)

Search for the "Google Cloud Spanner" driver, select it, and click the "Copy"
button to make a custom driver configuration:

![Copy DBeaver Google Spanner Driver](../../img/database-access/spanner-gui/dbeaver-copy-spanner-driver@2x.png)

Give the custom driver a name, e.g. "Teleport Spanner", then set "URL Template"
to this pattern string:

```code
jdbc:cloudspanner://127.0.0.1:{port}/projects/{server}/instances/{host}/databases/{database};usePlainText=true
```

![Create Custom DBeaver Google Spanner Driver](../../img/database-access/spanner-gui/dbeaver-create-spanner-driver@2x.png)

Click "Ok", then click "Close"

From the menu, click "Database > New Connection from JDBC URL":

Now copy the JDBC URL that was output by `tsh proxy db` and paste it:

![Create DBeaver Spanner Connection From JDBC URL](../../img/database-access/spanner-gui/dbeaver-connection-from-jdbc-url@2x.png)

Click "Proceed", then click "Finish".

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/gui-clients/spanner-reuse-port-note.mdx!)
