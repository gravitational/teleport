Use `tsh git ls` to view a list of GitHub organizations you have access to:
```code
$ tsh git ls
Type   Organization  Username URL
------ ------------- -------- --------------------------------
GitHub my-github-org my-user  https://github.com/my-github-org
```

Teleport requires your GitHub identity to impersonate you. If you haven't
provided it yet, run the following command:
```code
$ tsh git login --github-org my-github-org
  If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
   http://127.0.0.1:55555/some-id
  Your GitHub username is my-user.
```

This command opens a browser, prompting you to authenticate with GitHub via the
OAuth app:

To clone a repository from your GitHub organization, find the SSH clone URL and
run:
```code
$ tsh git clone git@github.com:my-github-org/my-repo.git
Cloning into 'my-repo'...
```

To configure an existing Git repository with Teleport, go to the repository and
run:
```code
$ tsh git config update
The current Git directory is configured with Teleport for GitHub organization "my-github-org".
```

Once the repo is cloned or configured, you can use `git` commands as normal:
```
$ cd my-repo
$ git fetch
```

Note that the OAuth app authentication flow and Git repository configuration are
one-time setups and don't need to be repeated.
