The guides in this section explain how to access infrastructure resources
protected by Teleport.

## Teleport clients

Teleport Connect is a graphical interface that allows you to access protected
resources, often without needing a third-party client tool. For a similar
experience within your browser, you can use the Teleport Web UI.

Teleport provides a command-line tool, `tsh`, that allows you to access
Teleport-protected resources using terminal-based workflows the same as a
protected resource's native tooling.

Read the [Introduction to Teleport
Clients](./teleport-clients/teleport-clients.mdx).

## MCP clients

You can configure MCP clients like Cursor and Claude Desktop to securely access
Teleport-protected resources.

Read [MCP Clients](./model-context-protocol/model-context-protocol.mdx).

## Third-party clients

You can use Teleport-issued credentials to give your third-party client tools,
including graphical clients and IDEs, access to Teleport-protected resources.
Read [Third-Party Clients](./third-party/third-party.mdx).
