h1: Store Teleport Private Keys in AWS KMS
---

This guide will show you how to set up your Teleport cluster to use the AWS Key
Management Service (KMS) to store and handle the CA private key material used to
sign all certificates issued by your cluster.

Teleport generates private key material for its internal Certificate Authorities
(CAs) during the first Auth Service instance's initial startup.
These CAs are used to sign all certificates issued to clients and hosts in the
Teleport cluster.
When configured to use AWS KMS, all private key material for these CAs
will be generated, stored, and used for signing inside of AWS KMS.
Instead of the actual private key, Teleport will only store the ID of the KMS
key.
In short, private key material will never leave AWS KMS.

If launching a new Teleport cluster this will all be handled during initial
startup with no specific interventions required after configuration.
For existing Teleport clusters that already have already generated software
private keys, a CA rotation must be performed.
Read on to [migrating an existing cluster](#migrating-an-existing-cluster) to
learn more.

## Prerequisites

The features documented on this page are available in Teleport `15.0.0` and
higher.

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

- An AWS account.

## Step 1/5. Configure AWS IAM permissions

Your Teleport Auth Service will need permissions to create, sign with, list,
and destroy KMS keys in your AWS account.

Start by creating the following AWS IAM policy in your account.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ListKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:ListKeys"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "CreateKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:CreateKey",
                "kms:TagResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/TeleportCluster": "<Var name="teleport.example.com" description="Your Teleport cluster name"/>",
                    "aws:ResourceTag/TeleportCluster": "<Var name="teleport.example.com" description="Your Teleport cluster name"/>"
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "UseKeys",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:GetPublicKey",
                "kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion",
                "kms:DescribeKey",
                "kms:ListResourceTags",
                "kms:Sign"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/TeleportCluster": "<Var name="teleport.example.com" description="Your Teleport cluster name"/>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can create the policy from the AWS console, or via the AWS CLI.

```code
$ aws iam create-policy --policy-name TeleportKMS --policy-document file://policy.json
{
    "Policy": {
        "PolicyName": "TeleportKMS",
        "PolicyId": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/TeleportKMS",
        "Path": "/",
        "DefaultVersionId": "v1",
        "AttachmentCount": 0,
        "PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount": 0,
        "IsAttachable": true,
        "CreateDate": "2024-01-29T23:05:06+00:00",
        "UpdateDate": "2024-01-29T23:05:06+00:00"
    }
}
```

Attach the policy to an IAM role that your Auth Service instances will
authenticate to your AWS account as.
You can attach the policy from the AWS console, or via the AWS CLI.

```code
$ aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <IAM role> --policy-arn <policy ARN>
```

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx service="the Teleport Auth Service"!)

<Admonition type="warning">
Be aware that anyone with access to this IAM role will be able create signatures
as if they are the Teleport CA.
It should be considered a highly privileged role and should be restricted as
much as possible.

If you provide AWS credentials to the Teleport Auth Service via the Instance
Metadata Service, be aware that any user with access to the instance could use
those credentials.
You may wish to use the following iptables rule to restrict IMDS access to the
root user only:

```sh
$ iptables -A OUTPUT -m owner ! --uid-owner 0 -d 169.254.169.254 -j REJECT
```
</Admonition>

## Step 2/5. Configure your Auth Service to use KMS keys

CA key parameters are statically configured in the `teleport.yaml` configuration
file of the Teleport Auth Service instances in your cluster.

Include the following `ca_key_params` configuration in the `auth_service` section.

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
# ...
auth_service:
  # ...
  ca_key_params:
    aws_kms:
      account: "<Var name="AWS account"/>"
      region: "<Var name="AWS region"/>"
```

If configuring this before the first start of a new Teleport cluster, the
initial CA keys will be generated in AWS KMS automatically and no additional
steps are necessary.
If you wish to migrate an existing Teleport cluster from software keys to AWS
KMS keys, read on to
[migrating an existing cluster](#migrating-an-existing-cluster).

## Step 3/3. Make sure everything is working

After starting up your Auth Service with the `aws_kms` configuration, you can
confirm that Teleport has generated AWS KMS keys in your account by viewing them
in the AWS Console.
You can also run the following `tctl` commands to find the ARN of each key.

```code
$ tctl get cert_authorities --with-secrets --format json | jq -r '.[].spec.active_keys.tls[0].key | select(.) | @base64d'
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/dd0f77e2-a1b7-4ecd-ba83-d29476c15fec
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/fe8daacb-2457-4639-aa68-2bdc38a47a89
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/fb48f161-55ba-47da-9d4e-24ed4ef8cce4
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/7c2ae604-8b8c-425e-8d53-c4d3070cdb10
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/d8a4196f-6864-421a-911f-16d69473135c
$ tctl get cert_authorities --with-secrets --format json | jq -r '.[].spec.active_keys.ssh[0].private_key | select(.) | @base64d'
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/dd8b4a02-5602-4d34-8773-a56e669db75f
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/026e3c42-0c37-40d0-b9f4-bd1fa394b9a9
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/ffa93061-0979-4ff1-b0af-d9a5dda6d894
$ tctl get cert_authorities --with-secrets --format json | jq -r '.[].spec.active_keys.jwt[0].private_key | select(.) | @base64d'
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/d4e63a5d-ed81-46c4-ad72-3f57a07eb9d5
awskms:arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/5c99e6aa-deb1-45c0-865e-08847214b7ab
```

Try logging in to the cluster with a Teleport user to make sure that new
certificates can be signed without error.

## Migrating an existing cluster

If you have an existing Teleport cluster it will have already created software
CA keys during its first start.
Those existing CA keys will have been used to sign all existing user and host
certificates, and will be trusted by all other services in your cluster.

In order for the Teleport Auth Service to generate new keys in AWS KMS and have
them trusted by the rest of the cluster, you will need to rotate all of your
Teleport CAs.

`teleport start` will print a warning during startup if any CA needs to be rotated.
Any users allowed the `update` verb for `cert_authority` resources in any of
their Teleport roles will also see a cluster alert reminding them to rotate the
CAs.

CA rotation can be performed manually or semi-automatically. See our admin guide
on [Certificate rotation](../../management/operations/ca-rotation.mdx).
All CAs listed in the output of `tctl status` must be rotated.
