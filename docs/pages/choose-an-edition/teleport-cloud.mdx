Teleport Enterprise Cloud is a managed service to provide access to secure
infrastructure all over the world without passwords or shared secrets.

When you [sign up for a Teleport Enterprise Cloud
account](https://goteleport.com/signup/), you will receive a subdomain of
`teleport.sh` that is dedicated to your tenant and points to the Teleport Proxy
Service. 

Our Teleport Enterprise Cloud team handles the following tasks for you:

- Auth and Proxy Service upgrades, security patches, scaling, monitoring,
  maintenance, and network configuration
- Auth Service backend management
- Backup and restore of cluster data
- Storage of audit logs and session recordings
- DNS record management

A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account takes minutes to set up. After that, you can
define roles, register SSO providers, and start connecting all of your
infrastructure, including servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, applications,
Windows desktops, and service accounts.
