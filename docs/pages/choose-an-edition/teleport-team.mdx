Teleport Team helps small organizations provide secure access to their infrastructure, with 
minimal configuration and cluster management. 

With Teleport Team, the Teleport Auth Service and Teleport Proxy Service are managed for you as cloud-based services. 
These services provide you with immediate access to a scalable and fault tolerant certificate authority and reverse 
proxy that you don't need to manage or maintain. You can focus on enrolling the resources you want to protect and configuring secure role-based access for private and public
networks across the globe.

After you start a [free trial](https://goteleport.com/signup) of Teleport Team,
you can set up role-based access control (RBAC), enable single sign-on with GitHub 
or the Teleport identity provider, and prevent unauthorized of organization resources.

</Notice>

This guide explains how to register a local server with a Teleport Team account. 
After you register the server, you can access it through the Teleport Web UI in a browser or using the terminal. 
You can also record your sessions, so you can review them later.

## Prerequisites

- A Teleport Team account. You can sign up for a free trial at the following page:

  https://goteleport.com/signup/

  After you sign up, you receive an email invitation to activate your account.
  Use this account to authenticate your identity when you access the Teleport
  Team tenant.

- Docker installed on your workstation. 

  This guide illustrates how to register a server with Teleport Team using a Docker 
  container and the Teleport SSH Service. 
  Docker is only required for the local demo environment used in this guide. 
  You can find installation instructions for Docker on [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). 
  If you want to register servers in Teleport Team without using Docker, see the getting started guide for
  [server access](../server-access/getting-started.mdx).

- The `tsh` client tool. 
  
  The `tsh` client tool is only required to access the server from a terminal. 
  For installation instructions, see [Installation Guide](../installation.mdx). 
  If you don't install the `tsh` client tool, you can access the server in 
  Teleport Team using the Web UI through your browser.

## Step 1/5. Spin up a server

To spin up a new server using Docker:

1. Open a terminal shell on your workstation.

1. Start a Docker container on your workstation to prepare a server that you want enroll 
as a resource in your Teleport Team tenant:

    ```code
    $ docker run --interactive --tty ubuntu:22.10 /bin/bash
    ```

    This command starts a new shell session in the `ubuntu:22.10` container. 

1. Run the following command to install `curl` and `telnet` from the package management repository:

    ```code
    $ apt update && apt install -y curl telnet
    ```

    The script that installs Teleport in this guide requires both `curl` and `telnet`
    to be installed.

    Keep the new shell open in your terminal.

## Step 2/5. Install the Teleport SSH Service

To install the Teleport SSH Service on your server:

1. Open a browser and go to the address for your Teleport Team tenant, 
<Var name="tenant-url"/>`.teleport.sh` (for example, `mytenant.teleport.sh`).

1. Sign in with the account credentials you used to activate your Teleport Team account.

    The first time you sign in, you are prompted to add your first resource: 

    ![Add your first resource](../../img/cloud/getting-started/add-my-first-resource@2x.png)

1. Click **Add my first resource** to open **Enroll New Resource**. 

1. Type _server_ in the search box to filter the list of resources.

    ![Select resource type](../../img/cloud/getting-started/choose-resource@2x.png)

1. Click *Ubuntu 14.04+* to register the server in the Docker container.

    After you select *Ubuntu 14.04+* as the resource type, the script to install and 
    configure the Teleport service is displayed. For example:

    ![Configure resource](../../img/cloud/getting-started/paste-script@2x.png)

    The Teleport installation script uses `sudo`, which is not installed on your 
    Docker container. Before copying the command to run the installation script, you 
    need to alias `sudo` in the container terminal shell session.

1. In the terminal with the container shell session, alias `sudo` by running 
the following command:
    
    ```code
    $ alias sudo=""
    ```

1. Copy the command to run the installation script from the Web UI and paste it 
into the container shell session.

    Leave the script running in the shell. After Teleport is installed on the 
    server, you'll see a message in the Web UI that your new Teleport instance
    was successfully detected:

    ![Connected successfully](../../img/cloud/getting-started/successfully-connected@2x.png)
    
    To continue, click **Next**.

1. Confirm that you want to authenticate as the `root` user and click **Next**:

    ![Choose your user](../../img/cloud/getting-started/set-up-access@2x.png)

1. Click **Test Connection** to verify access to the server.

     ![Start session](../../img/cloud/getting-started/test-connection@2x.png)


## Step 3/5. Start a session

To start a session on the server you just added to Teleport Team:

1. Click **Start Session** to start an interactive session.

    You should see a terminal prompt in a new browser window. Your Teleport Team 
    account routes your SSH connection through the Teleport Proxy Service, which
    connects to your container through a reverse tunnel. 

    Reverse tunnels allow Teleport to manage access to resources like Kubernetes 
    clusters and remote desktops, even if these resources are running on 
    private networks.

    <Notice type="tip">

    If you get an error connecting to your container, interrupt the `teleport`
    process in your container's shell with **Ctrl-C**, then run `teleport start` to
    restart the process.

    </Notice>
    
1. Execute some commands in your terminal. 

1. Enter the `exit` command to end the remote interactive session and
close the browser tab.

1. In the last step of **Enroll New Resource**, click **Finish**.

1. Click **Browse existing resources** to see your new server listed in the
Teleport Web UI.

## Step 4/5. Play back your session

As Teleport Team proxies SSH connections to registered servers, it records the
commands that users execute during their sessions so operators can play them
back later to investigate issues.

To playback a session in the Teleport Web UI:

1. Set the dropdown menu on the upper left of the screen to
**Management**.

1. Under Activity, click **Session Recordings**. 

    You will see the recording for your interactive session from the previous step listed.
    For example:

    ![Session recordings](../../img/cloud/getting-started/session-recordings@2x.png)

1. Click **Play** to see a full recording of your session.

## Step 5/5. Access the server from the command line

To access the server using commands in a terminal:

1. Open a new terminal window.

1. Sign in to your Teleport Team tenant by running the `tsh login` command  with the URL 
of your tenant and the name of your Teleport user:

    ```code
    $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="tenant-url" />.teleport.sh --user=<Var name="username" />
    ```

    When prompted, authenticate using your password, authenticator app, or hardware key.
    The command displays information about your Teleport Team tenant and account. For example:

    ```code
    > Profile URL:      https://tenant-url.teleport.sh:443
    Logged in as:       admin@teleport.example.com
    Cluster:            tenant-url.teleport.sh
    Roles:              access, auditor, editor
    Logins:             root
    Kubernetes:         enabled
    Valid until:        2023-07-08 01:35:20 -0700 PDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
    Extensions:         login-ip, permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy

1. List the servers your Teleport user can access. 

    ```code
    $ tsh ls
    ```

    You should see the name of the container you just registered. For example:
    
    ```code
    Node Name    Address    Labels
    ------------ ---------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    000000000000 ⟵ Tunnel   hostname=000000000000,teleport.internal/resource-id=000000000000
    ```

1. Access your server as the `root` user:

    ```code
    $ tsh ssh root@<Var name="node-name" />
    ```

## Next steps

This guide introduced how you can use Teleport Team to protect your
infrastructure by demonstrating how to register a server with your Teleport Team 
tenant. 

You can provide secure access to more of your infrastructure through 
Teleport Team by deploying one or more Teleport **agents** and configuring
role-based access control for users. Agents proxy traffic to all of 
your infrastructure resources—including servers, databases, Kubernetes
clusters, cloud provider APIs, and Windows desktops. Role-based access control
ensures that only authorized users are allowed access to those resources.

For more information about deploying agents, see the following topics:
- [Run Teleport Agents](../agents/introduction.mdx)
- [Deploy Teleport Agents with Terraform](../agents/deploy-agents-terraform.mdx)
- [Join Services to your Teleport Cluster](../agents/join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx)

For information about configuring roles, see the following topics:
- [Getting Started with Access Controls](../access-controls/getting-started.mdx)
- [Cluster Access and RBAC](../access-controls/guides.mdx)
- [Access Controls for Servers](../server-access/rbac/#role-configuration.mdx)
