title: "How to Choose a Teleport Edition"
description: "Determine whether to use the cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise, host your own Teleport Enterprise deployment, or try Teleport Community Edition for personal use."

The fully-featured edition of Teleport is called **Teleport Enterprise**.

For most users, we recommend [signing up](https://goteleport.com/signup) for a
cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise account. Our team at Teleport manages the
Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service, giving you a running Teleport cluster
where you can configure RBAC, set up Single Sign-On connectors, and register
resources by deploying additional Teleport services.

(cloud-hosted)](./teleport-cloud/introduction.mdx).

## Self-hosting Teleport Enterprise

For organizations with specific security needs, it is also possible to run a
self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster. Self-hosting Teleport Enterprise allows
you to set up advanced features like Hardware Security Modules and FedRAMP
compliance.

Enterprise](./teleport-enterprise/introduction.mdx).

## Migrating Teleport Enterprise clusters to the cloud

We recommend using the cloud-hosted edition of Teleport Enterprise for most
organizations, as it removes the overhead of maintaining, scaling, and securing
a deployment of the Auth Service and Proxy Service. To migrate from a
self-hosted Teleport Enterprise deployment to a cloud-hosted deployment, follow
the [migration guide](./migrate-to-cloud.mdx).

## Teleport Community Edition

For hobby and personal use, we provide a free, open source distribution of
Teleport that enables you to get secure access to databases, Windows desktops,
Kubernetes clusters, and more.

[Try out Teleport on a Linux server](../index.mdx). If you would like to take a
look at the source, visit the [Teleport GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport).
