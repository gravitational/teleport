description: The detailed guide to Teleport API

In most cases, you can interact with Teleport using our CLI tools, [tsh](cli-docs.mdx#tsh) and [tctl](cli-docs.mdx#tctl). However, you can also directly access the same gRPC API that `tctl` and `tsh` use.

## Getting started

Before you begin:

- Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.15+ and Setup Go Dev Environment
- Set up Teleport with ([Getting Started Guide](getting-started.mdx))

The easiest way to get started with the Teleport API is to clone the [Go Client Example](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/go-client) in our github repo. Follow the README there to quickly authenticate the API with your Teleport Auth Server.

If you want to start from scratch, simply set up a go module and run: 

```bash
$ go get github.com/gravitational/teleport/api
```

Then, follow the client documentation below to get the client up and running.

## Documentation

#### GoDoc

The API is documented through [go.pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client) using inline comments and examples. Below are a few noteworthy sections to check out:
 - [Overview](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#pkg-overview)
 - [New Client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#New)
 - [Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#Credentials)

There is also some additional information on this page below.

#### Credentials

Since there are several Credential loaders to choose from, here's a breakdown of each, along with a table for more details.

- [Profile Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#LoadProfile) are the easiest to get started with. All you have to do is login on your device with `tsh login`. Your Teleport proxy address and credentials will automatically be located and used. However, the other options don't necessarily require a login step and have the ability to authenticate long lived clients.
- [Identity Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#LoadIdentityFile) are the most well rounded in terms of usability, functionality, and customizability. Identity files can be generated through `tsh login` or `tctl auth sign`, making them ideal for both long lived proxy and auth server connections.
- [Key Pair Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#LoadKeyPair) have a much simpler implementation than the first two Credentials listed, and may feel more familiar. These are good for authenticating client's hosted on the auth server.
- [TLS Credentials](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client#LoadTLS) leaves everything up to the client user. This isn't recommended for most users and is mostly used internally, but some users may find that this fits their use case best.
