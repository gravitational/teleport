## Which Teleport features are currently supported by Machine ID?

Machine ID aims to provide access to Teleport and all the resources it protects,
however access to certain types of resources and certain types of access are not
yet supported.

Broadly, Machine ID **does** support the following Teleport features:
 - [Server Access](./getting-started.mdx)
 - [Database Access](./guides/databases.mdx)
 - [Kubernetes Access](../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
 - [Application Access](../application-access/introduction.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
   - Note: [AWS Console](../application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx) and API access is currently unsupported.
 - [Teleport API Access](../api/introduction.mdx)

These features are supported in Teleport OSS, Teleport Enterprise, and Teleport
Cloud.

The following features are **not** supported by Machine ID bots:
 - [Desktop Access](../desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
 - [User Impersonation](../access-controls/guides/impersonation.mdx): Machine 
   ID uses Role Impersonation which cannot be combined with User Impersonation
 - Multifactor authentication like [WebAuthn](../access-controls/guides/webauthn.mdx) and [Passwordless](../access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx)
 - [AWS Console Access](../application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx)

## Can Machine ID be used within CI/CD jobs?

Yes, however it depends on your CI/CD provider. It's currently a good fit in the
following situations:

 - Either short-lived or long-lived tasks run on AWS instances using AWS IAM
   joining.
 - Long-lived worker nodes, like self-hosted Jenkins workers, using token-based
   joining.

We are working to support SaaS-based CI/CD providers like GitHub Actions in the
the near future, but cannot currently recommend using Machine ID on these
providers.

## Can Machine ID be used with Trusted Clusters ?

Partially. We currently support SSH access to leaf clusters when using `tsh` to
make the connection. To do this, you will need to provide `tsh` with the generated identity file
output in the destination directory to `tsh`, for example:

```code
$ tsh -i /opt/machine-id/identity --proxy root-cluster.example.com ssh --cluster leaf-cluster.example.com root@node.leaf-cluster.example.com
```

We hope to introduce support for generating a `ssh_config` that is compatible
with leaf clusters for use with OpenSSH. You can track support for this on the 
[GitHub Machine ID Trusted Cluster Support issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/13792).

We currently do not support Application Access, Database Access or Kubernetes
Access to resources in leaf clusters.

## Should I define allowed logins as user traits or within roles?

When defining the logins that your bot will be allowed to use, there are two
options:

- Directly adding the login to the `logins` section of the role that your bot
  will impersonate.
- Adding the login to the logins trait of the bot user, and impersonating a role
  that includes the `{{ internal.logins }}` role variable.

For simpler scenarios, where you only expect to configure your bot with a single 
destination or role, it is permissible to add the login to the logins trait of 
the bot user. This will allow you to leverage existing roles like `access`.

For situations where your bot is producing certificates for different roles in
different destinations it is important to consider if using login traits will 
grant access to resources that you were not intending to grant. For this reason,
we recommend that in this situation you create bespoke roles that directly
include the logins that you wish to grant to the certificates output in that
destination.
