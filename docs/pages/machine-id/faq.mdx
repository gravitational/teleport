## Can Machine ID be used within CI/CD jobs?

Yes, however it depends on your CI/CD provider. It's currently a good fit in the
following situations:

 - Either short-lived or long-lived tasks run on AWS instances using AWS IAM
   joining.
 - Long-lived worker nodes, like self-hosted Jenkins workers, using token-based
   joining.
 - You use a supported SaaS CI/CD Provider:
   - GitHub Actions (Teleport 11)
   - CircleCI (coming in Teleport 11.1)

## Can Machine ID be used with Trusted Clusters ?

From Teleport 12.2, Trusted Cluster support for SSH Access has been included in
Machine ID.

We currently do not support access to applications, databases, or Kubernetes
clusters in Trusted Clusters configured as leaf clusters.

## Should I define allowed logins as user traits or within roles?

When defining the logins that your bot will be allowed to use, there are two
options:

- Directly adding the login to the `logins` section of the role that your bot
  will impersonate.
- Adding the login to the logins trait of the bot user, and impersonating a role
  that includes the `{{ internal.logins }}` role variable. This is usually done
  by providing the `--logins` parameter when creating the bot.

For simpler scenarios — where you only expect the bot to use a single output
or role — you can add the login to the logins trait of the bot user. This
approach allows you to leverage default roles like `access`.

For situations where your bot is producing certificates for different roles in
different outputs, it is important to consider whether using a login trait
grants access to resources that you didn't intend. To prevent a login trait from
granting access you didn't intend, we recommend that you create bespoke roles
that explicitly specify the logins that should be included in the certificates.

## Can Machine ID be used with per-session MFA?

We do not currently support Machine ID and per-session MFA. Enabling per-session
MFA globally, or for roles impersonated by Machine ID, will prevent credentials
produced by Machine ID from being used to connect to resources.

As a work-around, ensure that per-session MFA is enforced on individual roles
rather than enforced globally, and that it is not enforced for roles that you
will impersonate using Machine ID.
