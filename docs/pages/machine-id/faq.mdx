## Which Teleport features are currently supported by Machine ID?

Machine ID aims to provide access to Teleport and all the resources it protects,
however access to certain types of resources and certain types of access are not
yet supported.

Broadly, Machine ID **does** support the following Teleport features:
 - [Server Access](./getting-started.mdx)
 - [Database Access](./guides/databases.mdx)
 - [Kubernetes Access](../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
 - [Application Access](../application-access/introduction.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
   - Note: [AWS Console](../application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx) and API access is currently unsupported.
 - [Teleport API Access](../api/introduction.mdx)

These features are supported in Teleport OSS, Teleport Enterprise, and Teleport
Cloud.

The following features are **not** supported by Machine ID bots:
 - [Desktop Access](../desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
 - [User Impersonation](../access-controls/guides/impersonation.mdx): Machine 
   ID uses Role Impersonation which cannot be combined with User Impersonation
 - Multifactor authentication like [WebAuthn](../access-controls/guides/webauthn.mdx) and [Passwordless](../access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx)
 - [AWS Console Access](../application-access/guides/aws-console.mdx)

## Can Machine ID be used within CI/CD jobs?

Yes, however it depends on your CI/CD provider. It's currently a good fit in the
following situations:

 - Either short-lived or long-lived tasks run on AWS instances using AWS IAM
   joining.
 - Long-lived worker nodes, like self-hosted Jenkins workers, using token-based
   joining.

We are working to support SaaS-based CI/CD providers like GitHub Actions in the
the near future, but cannot currently recommend using Machine ID on these
providers.

## Can Machine ID be used with Trusted Clusters ?

Partially. We currently support SSH access to leaf clusters when using `tsh` to
make the connection. To do this, you will need to provide the identity file
output in the destination directory to `tsh`, for example:

```code
$ tsh -i /opt/machine-id/identity --proxy root-cluster.example.com ssh --cluster leaf-cluster.example.com root@node.leaf-cluster.example.com
```

We hope to introduce support for generating a `ssh_config` that is compatible
with leaf clusters for use with OpenSSH. You can track support for this on the 
[GitHub Machine ID Trusted Cluster Support issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/13792).

We currently do not support Application Access, Database Access or Kubernetes
Access to resources in leaf clusters.
