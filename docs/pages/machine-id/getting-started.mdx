title: Machine ID Getting Started Guide
description: Getting started with Teleport Machine ID
---

In this getting started guide, you will use Machine ID to create a bot user for
a machine and use that identity to connect to said machine.

Here's an overview of what you will do:

1. Download and install Teleport (=teleport.version=)
2. Create a bot user
3. Start Machine ID
4. Use certificates issued by Machine ID to connect to a remote machine

## Prerequisites

Before using Machine ID, you will need an existing Teleport cluster or a
Teleport Cloud account.

If you have not set up a Teleport cluster before, follow the
[Getting started](https://goteleport.com/docs/getting-started) guide.

## Step 1/4. Download and install Teleport (=teleport.version=)

In this step, you will be downloading and installing Teleport binaries onto the
machine you wish to assign an identity to. 

Each Teleport package hosted on our
downloads page ships with several useful binaries, including `teleport`,
`tctl`, `tsh`, and `tbot`:

- `teleport` is the daemon used to initialize a Teleport cluster; this binary is not used in this guide
- `tctl` is the administrative tool you will use to create the bot user (step 1/4)
- `tsh` is the client tool you will use to log in to the Teleport Cluster (steps 2/4 and 4/4)
- `tbot` is the Machine ID tool you will use to associate a bot user with a machine (step 3/4)

Machine ID is available starting from the Teleport `9.0.0` release. Download
the appropriate Teleport package for your platform from our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download).

## Step 2/4. Create a bot user

Before you create a bot user, you need to determine which role(s) you want to
assign to it. You can use the `tctl` command below to examine what roles exist
on your system.

<Details scope={["cloud"]} scopeOnly={true}>
On your client machine, log in to Teleport using `tsh`, then use `tctl` to examine
what roles exist on your system.
</Details>
<Details scope={["oss","enterprise"]} scopeOnly={true}>
Connect to the Teleport Auth Server and use `tctl` to examine what roles exist on
your system.
</Details>

```code
$ tctl get roles --format=text
```

You will see something like the output below on a fresh install of Teleport with the
default roles—your cluster may have different roles. In this example, let's
assume you want to give the bot the `access` role to allow it to connect to
machines within your cluster.

```
Role    Allowed to login as                           Node Labels Access to resources
------- --------------------------------------------- ----------- ----------------------------------------
access  {{internal.logins}}                           <all nodes> event:list,read,session:read,list
auditor no-login-6566121f-b602-47f1-a118-c9c618ee5aec             session:list,read,event:list,read
editor                                                            user:list,create,read,update,delete,...
```

Machine ID can join with a token or the [IAM Method](https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws) on AWS.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Token-based Joining">
  ```code
  $ tctl bots add robot --roles=access
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="IAM Method">
  First, create an IAM method token that specifies the AWS account from which
  the bot can join.

  ```
  kind: token
  version: v2
  metadata:
    # The token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
    # running in your AWS account to use this token.
    name: iam-token
    # Set a long expiry time for how long you want to support IAM method for
    # joining. It is safe to set this value to a very long time.
    expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  spec:
    # Only allow bots to join using this token.
    roles: [Bot]
  
    # Set the join method to be IAM.
    join_method: iam

    # Define the name of the bot that will be allowed to use this token. Note,
    # the "bot-" prefix is required. The name of the bot you will create is "robot".
    bot_name: robot
  
    allow:
    # Restrict the AWS account and (optionally) ARN that can use this token.
    # This information can be obtained from running the
    # "aws sts get-caller-identity" command from the CLI.
    - aws_account: "111111111111"
      aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/teleport-bot-role/i-*"
  ```

  Next, create the bot user.

  ```
  $ tctl bots add robot --token=iam-token --roles=access
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3/4. Start Machine ID

Now start Machine ID using the `tbot` binary. The `tbot start` command will
start running Machine ID in a loop, writing renewable certificates to
`/var/lib/teleport` and the short-lived certificates your application will use
to `/opt/machine-id`.

In a production environment you will want to run Machine ID in the background
using a service manager like systemd. However, in this guide you will run it in
the foreground to better understand how it works.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Token-based Joining">
  ```code
  $ tbot start \
     --data-dir=/var/lib/teleport \
     --destination-dir=/opt/machine-id \
     --token=00000000000000000000000000000000 \
     --join-method=token \
     --ca-pin=sha256:1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 \
     --auth-server=auth.example.com:3025
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="IAM Method">
  ```code
  $ tbot start \
     --data-dir=/var/lib/teleport \
     --destination-dir=/opt/machine-id \
     --token=iam-token \
     --join-method=iam \
     --ca-pin=sha256:1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 \
     --auth-server=auth.example.com:3025
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Replace the following fields with values from your own cluster.

- `token` is the token output by the `tctl bots add` command or the name of your IAM method token
- `ca-pin` is the CA Pin for your Teleport cluster, and is output by the `tctl bots add` command
- `destination-dir` is where Machine ID writes renewable certificates, which are only used by Machine ID and should not be used by applications and tools
- `data-dir` is where Machine ID writes the short-lived certificate. This certificate should be used by applications and tools.
<Details scope={["cloud"]} scopeOnly={true}>
- `auth-server` is the address of your Teleport Auth Server
</Details>
<Details scope={["oss","enterprise"]} scopeOnly={true}>
- `auth-server` is the address of your Teleport Cloud Proxy Server
</Details>

Now that Machine ID has successfully started, let's investigate the
`/opt/machine-id` directory to see what was written to disk.

```
$ tree /opt/machine-id
machine-id
├── key
├── key.pub
├── known_hosts
├── ssh_config
├── sshcacerts
├── sshcert
├── tlscacerts
└── tlscert

0 directories, 8 files
```

This directory contains private key material in the `key.*` files, SSH
certificates in the `ssh*` files, X.509 certificates in the `tls*` files, and
OpenSSH configuration in the `ssh_config` and `known_hosts` files to make it easy
to integrate Machine ID with external applications and tools.

## Step 4/4. Use certificates issued by Machine ID

To use Machine ID, find a host that you want to connect to within your cluster
using `tsh ls`. You might see output like the following on your system.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address        Labels                        
--------- -------------- ----------------------------- 
node-name  127.0.0.1:3022 arch=x86_64,group=api-servers 
```

To use Machine ID with the OpenSSH integration, run the following command to
connect to `node-name` within cluster `example.com`.

```
ssh -F /opt/machine-id/ssh_config root@node-name.example.com
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Roles must have logins defined">
  If you see the below error, it means the user you are trying to log in as is
  not specified under `logins` in the role you are using. If you have been
  following along with the `access` role, run
  `tctl get roles/access > access.yaml`, update the `logins` field, and update
  your role with `tctl create -f access.yaml`.

  ```code
  $ ssh -F /opt/machine-id/ssh_config root@node-name
  root@node-name: Permission denied (publickey).
  kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
  ```
</Admonition>

Now you can replace any invocations of `ssh` with the above command to provide
your applications and tools a machine identity that can be rotated, audited,
and controlled with all the familiar Teleport access controls.
