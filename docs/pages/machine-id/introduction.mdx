# Machine ID

Machine ID is a daemon that programmatically issues and renews short-lived
certificates to any service account (e.g., a CI/CD server) by retrieving
credentials from the Teleport Auth Service. This enables fine-grained
role-based access controls and audit.

Some of the things you can do with Machine ID:

* Machines can retrieve short-lived SSH certificates for CI/CD pipelines.
* Machines can retrieve short-lived X.509 certificates for use with databases or applications.
* Configure role-based access controls and locking for machines.
* Capture access events in the audit log.

TODO(russjones): Once we have a demo video for Machine ID, include it here.

## Demo

Let's create a bot and use the machine identity to connect to a server.
