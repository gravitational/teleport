title: Machine ID with Application Access
description: Accessing web applications with Machine ID
---

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to configure an automated service to use
Machine ID to access a web application protected by Teleport.

With Machine ID, Teleport issues short-lived certificates, tied to a machine
identity, that can be rotated, audited, and managed with the same access
controls that Teleport provides for human users.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- If you have not already connected your application to Teleport, follow
  the [Application Access Getting Started Guide](../../application-access/getting-started.mdx).
- If you're not already familiar with Machine ID, follow the
  [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.mdx) to familiarize yourself with
  Machine ID. You'll also need `tctl` access to initially configure the bot.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- Ensure the `tbot` binary is installed on your Machine ID client system.
  The client system is any system from which you want to access your Teleport
  cluster and the resources it protects from an automated service. Refer to our
  [Installation guide](../../installation.mdx) for instructions on installing
  Teleport, which includes the necessary `tbot` binary.

## Step 1/3. Create a Machine ID bot and assign permissions

In this example you'll start by creating a bot named "example" and assign it a
role granting access to some set of apps by label.

First, on a node with `tctl` access (such as your local machine), create a file
named `role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: machine-id-app-role
version: v5
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

This role allows access to all apps. You might consider restricting the label
selector here, especially for production deployments.

Once finished, create the role on your Teleport cluster:
```code
$ tctl create -f role.yaml
```

## Step 2/3. Configure and start Machine ID

First, on a node with `tctl` access, create a new Machine ID bot using the role
created in the previous step:
```code
$ tctl bots add example --roles=machine-id-app-role
```

The creates a bot named `example` with permissions to access the apps as you
configured above. Be sure to note the bot join token and CA PIN.

Next, on the bot node, create a Machine ID configuration file at
`/etc/tbot.yaml`:

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>
```yaml
auth_server: "example.teleport.sh:443"
onboarding:
  join_method: "token"
  token: "00000000000000000000000000000000"
  ca_pins:
  - "sha256:1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
outputs:
  - type: application
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/machine-id
    app_name: grafana-example
```
</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
```yaml
auth_server: "teleport.example.com:443"
onboarding:
  join_method: "token"
  token: "(=presets.tokens.first=)"
  ca_pins:
  - "(=presets.ca_pin=)"
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
outputs:
  - type: application
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/machine-id
    app_name: grafana-example
```
</ScopedBlock>

Be sure to configure the `token` and `ca_pins` fields to match the output from
`tctl bots add ...`, and set `app` to match the desired name as shown in
`tsh apps ls`. For this example, we're using the `grafana-example` app.

Machine ID also allows you to use Linux ACLs to control access to certificates
on disk. You will use this to ensure only your automated service has access to the
short-lived certificates Machine ID uses.

We'll work with the assumption you will be running Machine ID as the Linux user
`teleport` and your automated service as the Linux user `app`. Create and
initialize the destination directory by running this `tbot init` command either
as `root` or as the `teleport` user:

```code
$ tbot init \
    -c /etc/tbot.yaml \
    --init-dir=/opt/machine-id \
    --bot-user=teleport \
    --owner=teleport:teleport \
    --reader-user=app
```

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/machine-id-init-bot-data.mdx!)

Next, you will use systemd to run Machine ID in the background on your
bot node. Create a systemd.unit file at
`/etc/systemd/system/machine-id.service`:

```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Teleport Machine ID Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=teleport
Group=teleport
Restart=on-failure
Environment="TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/tbot start -c /etc/tbot.yaml
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
PIDFile=/run/machine-id.pid
LimitNOFILE=524288

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

`TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY` enables the submission of anonymous usage
telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable
this by omitting this.

Finally, run the following commands to start Machine ID:

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/machine-id-service.mdx!)

## Step 3/3. Connect to your web application with the Machine ID identity

With Machine ID up and running, there should be certificates in
`/opt/machine-id` that your automated  service will use to connect to your web
application. This can be verified by examining the `tbot` log:

```code
$ journalctl -u machine-id | grep -i app
Jul 29 12:34:56 example tbot[29177]: INFO [TBOT]      Generated identity for app {"grafana-example"} tbot/renew.go:429
```

Given the output destination directory `/opt/machine-id`, the following
certificate files can be used:
 - `/opt/machine-id/tlscert`: the client TLS certificate
 - `/opt/machine-id/key`: the TLS certificate's private key

You may use these credentials with any client application that supports them.

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>
The Teleport Proxy makes apps available via subdomains of its public web
address. Given an app named `grafana-example` and a Teleport Proxy at
`https://example.teleport.sh:443`, the app may be accessed at
`https://grafana-example.example.teleport.sh:443`.

For example, to access the Grafana API using `curl`:
```code
$ curl --user admin:admin \
  --cert /opt/machine-id/tlscert \
  --key /opt/machine-id/key \
  https://grafana-example.example.teleport.sh/api/users
```
</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
The Teleport Proxy makes apps available via subdomains of its public web
address. Given an app named `grafana-example` and a Teleport Proxy at
`https://teleport.example.com:443`, the app may be accessed at
`https://grafana-example.teleport.example.com:443`.

For example, to access the Grafana API using `curl`:
```code
$ curl --user admin:admin \
  --cert /opt/machine-id/tlscert \
  --key /opt/machine-id/key \
  https://grafana-example.teleport.example.com/api/users
```
</ScopedBlock>

Note that in the example above, we include `--user` to provide a local username
and password to our Grafana instance. This is not necessary if your application
either requires no additional authentication, or if you've configured 
[JWT authentication](../../application-access/jwt/introduction.mdx) for your
app.

No CA certificate needs to be specified so long as your Teleport Proxy is
configured with a valid wildcard CA from Let's Encrypt or another public
certificate authority.

Note that if the certificates are invalid or otherwise misconfigured, clients
will be redirected to the Teleport login page when attempting to access the app.

<Admonition type="note" title="Proxy Note">
While it's usually best to access apps through the public Teleport Proxy
Service, it's also possible to open a local proxy to the app using
`tbot proxy app ...` in situations where the Teleport Proxy Service's app endpoints are
unavailable:

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>
```code
$ tbot proxy --destination-dir=/opt/machine-id --proxy=example.teleport.sh:443 app --port=1234 grafana-example
```
</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>
```code
$ tbot proxy --destination-dir=/opt/machine-id --proxy=teleport.example.com:443 app --port=1234 grafana-example
```
</ScopedBlock>

You may now connect to the app via a local proxy at `http://localhost:1234`:

```code
$ curl --user admin:admin http://localhost:1234/api/users
```

Note that any clients with access to `localhost` may connect to this proxy
without additional authentication, so this should only be run in trusted
environments.
</Admonition>

## Troubleshooting

### Client application requires certificates with standard extensions

If your automated service requires TLS certificates with a specific file
extension, you may also enable the `specific_tls_naming` option for the output:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: application
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/machine-id
    app_name: grafana-example
    specific_tls_naming: true
```

This will generate `tls.crt` and `tls.key` inside `/opt/machine-id`
with identical content to the certificate files listed above.

<Admonition type="note" title="Config Templates">
The `tls` configuration template is one of several supported template types; 
refer to the [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) for a
list of all possible configuration templates.
</Admonition>

Be sure to re-run `tbot init ...` to configure permissions for the new file if
config templates are changed.

### Clients are redirected to the Teleport login page

As with human users, scripted clients will be redirected to the Teleport login
page when attempting to access an app through the Teleport Proxy Service without valid
credentials.

Ensure the bot's certificates have not expired and that the client application
has been configured to use both the client certificate and key.

## Next steps

- Review the [Access Controls Reference](../../access-controls/reference.mdx#roles)
  to learn about restricting which Applications and other Teleport resources
  your bot may access.
- Configure [JWTs](../../application-access/jwt/introduction.mdx) for your
  Application to remove the need for additional login credentials.
