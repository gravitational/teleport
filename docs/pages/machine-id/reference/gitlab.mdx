description: Reference for GitLab joining
---

This document acts a reference for GitLab CI and Machine ID. You will find
links to in-depth guides as well as a full description of the configuration
options available when using the GitLab join method.

## Guides

You can read step-by-step guides on using Machine ID and GitHub Actions:

- [Using Machine ID with GitLab](../guides/gitlab.mdx): How to
  use Machine ID to SSH into Teleport nodes from GitLab CI.

## GitLab join token

A GitLab join token contains allow rules that describe which pipelines can
use that token in order to join the Teleport cluster. A rule can contain
multiple fields, and any pipeline that matches all of the fields within a
single rule is granted access.

The following constraints exist:
- `sub`: a string uniquely identifying the CI run's source. It follows the
  following format:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name identifies the token. When configuring a bot or node to join using this
  # token, this name should be specified.
  name: gitlab-demo
spec:
  # The Bot role indicates that this token grants access to a bot user, rather
  # than allowing a node to join.
  roles: [Bot]
  # join_method for GitLab joining will always be "gitlab".
  join_method: gitlab

  # bot_name specifies the name of the bot that this token will grant access to
  # when it is used.
  bot_name: gitlab-demo

  gitlab:
    # domain should be the domain of your GitLab instance. If you are using
    # GitLab's cloud hosted offering, omit this field entirely.
    domain: gitlab.example.com
    # allow is an array of rule configurations for what GitLab CI jobs should be
    # allowed to join. All options configured within one allow entry
    # must be satisfied for the GitLab CI run to be allowed to join. Where
    # multiple allow entries are specified, any job which satisfies all of the
    # options within a single entry will be allowed to join.
    #
    # An allow entry must include at least one of:
    # - project_path
    # - namespace_path
    # - sub
    # This ensures that GitLab CI runs in other GitLab user's projects are not
    # able to access your Teleport cluster.
    allow:
        # project_path restricts joins to jobs that originate within the
        # specified project.
      - project_path: my-user/my-project
        # namespace_path restricts joins to any run within project that exists
        # within the specified namespace. A namespace will either be a username
        # or the name of a group.
        namespace_path: my-user
        # pipeline_source restricts joins to jobs triggered by certain criteria,
        # e.g triggered through the web interface.
        pipeline_source: web
        # environment restricts joins to jobs that are associated with the
        # specified environment
        environment: production
        # ref_type restricts joins to jobs that were triggered by a specific
        # type of git reference. Either `branch` or `tag`.
        ref_type: branch
        # ref restricts joins to jobs that were triggered by a specific git
        # reference. Combine this with `ref_type` to create allow rules that
        # can only be triggered by a specific branch or tag.
        ref: main
        # sub is a single string that concatenates the project_path, ref_type
        # and ref. This can be used to restrict joins using a single string,
        # whilst also describing a specific project and git ref.
        #
        # It is better to use the individual fields, as it is easy to mis-format
        # the sub string.
        sub: project_path:my-user/my-project:ref_type:branch:ref:main
```
