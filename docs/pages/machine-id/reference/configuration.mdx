title: Machine ID Configuration Reference
description: Configuration reference for Teleport Machine ID.
---

This reference documents the various options that can be configured in the `tbot`
configuration file. This configuration file offers more control than
configuring `tbot` using CLI parameters alone.

To configure `tbot` to use a configuration file, specify the path with the `-c`
flag:

```code
$ tbot -c ./tbot.yaml
```

In this reference, the term **artifact** refers an item that `tbot` writes to a
destination as part of the process of generating an output. Examples of
artifacts include configuration files, certificates, and cryptographic key
material. Usually, artifacts are files, but this term is explicitly avoided
because a destination isn't required to be a filesystem.

## Configuration v2

From Teleport 14, `tbot` supports the v2 configuration version.

```yaml
# version specifies the version of the configuration file in use. `v2` is the
# most recent and should be used for all new bots. The rest of this example
# is in the `v2` schema.
version: v2

# debug enables verbose logging to stderr. If unspecified, this defaults to
# false.
debug: true

# auth_server specifies the address of the Auth Service instance that `tbot` should connect
# to. You should prefer specifying `proxy_server` to specify the Proxy Service
# address.
auth_server: "teleport.example.com:3025"

# proxy_server specifies the address of the Teleport Proxy Service that `tbot` should
# connect to.
# It is recommended to use the address of your Teleport Proxy Service, or, if using
# Teleport Cloud, the address of your Teleport Cloud instance.
proxy_server: "teleport.example.com:443" # or "example.teleport.sh:443" for Teleport Cloud

# certificate_ttl specifies how long certificates generated by `tbot` should
# live for. It should be a positive, numeric value with an `m` (for minutes) or
# `h` (for hours) suffix. By default, this value is `1h`.
certificate_ttl: "1h"

# renewal_interval specifies how often `tbot` should aim to renew the
# outputs it has generated. It should be a positive, numeric value with an
# `m` (for minutes) or `h` (for hours) suffix. The default value is `20m`.
# This value must be lower than `certificate_ttl`.
# This value is ignored when using `tbot` is running in one-shot mode.
renewal_interval: "20m"

# oneshot configures `tbot` to exit immediately after generating the outputs.
# The default value is `false`. A value of `true` is useful in ephemeral environments, like
# CI/CD.
oneshot: false

# onboarding is a group of configuration options that control how `tbot` will
# authenticate with the Teleport cluster.
onboarding:
  # token specifies which join token, configured in the Teleport cluster,
  # should be used to join the Teleport cluster.
  #
  # This can also be an absolute path to a file containing the value you wish
  # to be used.
  # File path example:
  # token: /var/lib/teleport/tokenjoin
  token: "00000000000000000000000000000000"

  # join_method must be the join method associated with the specified token
  # above. This setting should match the value output when creating the bot using
  # `tctl`.
  #
  # Support values include:
  # - `token`
  # - `azure`
  # - `gcp`
  # - `circleci`
  # - `github`
  # - `gitlab`
  # - `iam`
  # - `ec2`
  # - `kubernetes`
  # - `spacelift`
  join_method: "token"

  # ca_pins are used to validate the identity of the Teleport Auth Service on
  # first connect. This should not be specified when using Teleport Cloud or
  # connecting through a Teleport Proxy.
  ca_pins:
    - "(=presets.ca_pin=)"
    - "(=presets.ca_pin=)"

  # ca_path is used to specify where a CA file can be found that can be used to
  # validate the identity of the Teleport Auth Service on first connect.
  # This should not be specified when using Teleport Cloud or connecting through a
  # Teleport Proxy. The ca_pins option should be preferred over ca_path.
  ca_path: "/path/to/ca.pem"

# storage specifies the destination that `tbot` should use to store its
# internal state. This state is sensitive, and you should ensure that the
# destination you specify here can only be accessed by `tbot`.
#
# If unspecified, storage is set to a directory destination with a path
# of `/var/lib/teleport/bot`.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot

# outputs specifies what artifacts `tbot` should generate and renew when it
# runs.
#
# See the full list of supported outputs and their configuration options
# under the Outputs section of this reference page.
outputs:
  - type: identity
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/machine-id
```

If no configuration file is provided, a simple configuration is used based
on the provided CLI flags. Given the following sample CLI from
`tctl bots add ...`:

```code
$ tbot start \
   --destination-dir=./tbot-user \
   --token=00000000000000000000000000000000 \
   --ca-pin=(=presets.ca_pin=) \
   --proxy-server=example.teleport.sh:443
```

it uses a configuration equivalent to the following:

```yaml
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443

onboarding:
  join_method: "token"
  token: "(=presets.tokens.first=)"
  ca_pins:
    - "(=presets.ca_pin=)"

storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot

outputs:
  - type: identity
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: ./tbot-user
```

### Outputs

Outputs define what actions `tbot` should take when it runs. They describe
the format of the certificates to be generated, the roles used to generate the certificates, and the
destination where they should be written.

There are multiple types of output. Select the one that is most appropriate for
your intended use-case.

#### `identity`

The `identity` output can be used to authenticate:

- SSH access to your Teleport servers, using `tsh`, openssh and tools like
  ansible.
- Administrative actions against your cluster using tools like `tsh` or `tctl`.
- Management of Teleport resources using the Teleport Terraform provider.
- Access to the Teleport API using the Teleport Go SDK.

See the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started.mdx) to see the `identity`
output used in context.

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the output. For the identity output, this will
# always be `identity`.
type: identity

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/common-output-config.yaml!)
```

### `application`

The `application` output is used to generate credentials that can be used to
access applications that have been configured with Teleport.

See the [Machine ID with Application Access guide](../access-guides/applications.mdx)
to see the `application` output used in context.

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the output. For the application output, this will
# always be `application`.
type: application
# app_name specifies the application name, as configured in your Teleport
# cluster, that `tbot` should generate credentials for.
# This field must be specified.
app_name: grafana

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/common-output-config.yaml!)
```

#### `database`

The `database` output is used to generate credentials that can be used to
access databases that have been configured with Teleport.

See the [Machine ID with Database Access guide](../access-guides/databases.mdx)
to see the `database` output used in context.

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the output. For the database output, this will
# always be `database`.
type: database
# service is the name of the database server, as configured in Teleport, that
# the output should generate credentials for. This field must be specified.
service: my-postgres-server
# database is the name of the specific database on the specified database
# server to generate credentials for. This field doesn't need to be specified
# for database types that don't support multiple individual databases.
database: my-database
# username is the name of the user on the specified database server to
# generate credentials for. This field doesn't need to be specified
# for database types that don't have users.
username: my-user
# format specifies the format to use for output artifacts. If
# unspecified, a default format is used. See the table titled "Supported
# formats" below for the full list of supported values.
format: tls

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/common-output-config.yaml!)
```

##### Supported formats

You can provide the following values to the `format` configuration field in
the `database` output type:

| `format`      | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| Unspecified   | Provides a certificate in `tlscert`, a private key in `key` and the CA in `teleport-database-ca.crt`. This is compatible with most clients and databases. |
| `mongo`       | Provides `mongo.crt` and `mongo.cas`. This is designed to be used with MongoDB clients. |
| `cockroach`   | Provides `cockroach/node.key`, `cockroach/node.crt`, and `cockroach/ca.crt`. This is designed to be used with CockroachDB clients. |
| `tls`         | Provides `tls.key`, `tls.crt`, and `tls.cas`. This is for generic clients that require the specific file extensions. |

#### `kubernetes`

The `kubernetes` output is used to generate credentials that can be used to
access Kubernetes clusters that have been configured with Teleport.

It outputs a `kubeconfig.yaml` in the output destination, which can be used
with `kubectl`.

See the [Machine ID with Kubernetes Access guide](../access-guides/kubernetes.mdx)
to see the `kubernetes` output used in context.

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the output. For the kubernetes output, this will
# always be `kubernetes`.
type: kubernetes
# kubernetes_cluster is the name of the Kubernetes cluster, as configured in
# Teleport, that the output should generate credentials and a kubeconfig for.
# This field must be specified.
kubernetes_cluster: my-cluster

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/common-output-config.yaml!)
```

#### `ssh_host`

The `ssh_host` output is used to generate the artifacts required to configure
an OpenSSH server with Teleport in order to allow Teleport users to connect to
it.

The output generates the following artifacts:
- `ssh_host-cert.pub`: an SSH certificate signed by the Teleport host certificate authority.
- `ssh_host`: the private key associated with the SSH host certificate.
- `ssh_host-user-ca.pub`: an export of the Teleport user certificate authority in an OpenSSH compatible format.

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the output. For the ssh host output, this will
# always be `ssh_host`.
type: ssh_host
# principals is the list of host names to include in the host certificates.
# These names should match the names that clients use to connect to the host.
principals:
  - host.example.com

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/common-output-config.yaml!)
```

### Destinations

A destination is somewhere that `tbot` can read and write artifacts.

Destinations are used in two places in the `tbot` configuration:

- Specifying where `tbot` should store its internal state.
- Specifying where an output should write its generated artifacts.

Destinations come in multiple types. Usually, the `directory` type is the most
appropriate.

#### `directory`

The `directory` destination type stores artifacts as files in a specified
directory. 

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the destination. For the directory destination,
# this will always be `directory`.
type: directory

# path specifies the path to the directory that this destination should write
# to. This directory should already exist, or `tbot init` should be used to
# create it with the correct permissions.
path: /opt/machine-id

# symlinks configures the behaviour of symlink attack prevention.
# Requires Linux 5.6+.
# Supported values:
#   * try-secure (default): Attempt to securely read and write certificates
#     without symlinks, but fall back (with a warning) to insecure read
#     and write if the host doesn't support this.
#   * secure: Attempt to securely read and write certificates, with a hard error
#     if unsupported.
#   * insecure: Quietly allow symlinks in paths.
symlinks: try-secure
# acls configures whether Linux Access Control List (ACL) setup should occur for
# this destination.
# Requires Linux with a file system that supports ACLs.
# Supported values:
#   * try (default on Linux): Attempt to use ACLs, warn at runtime if ACLs
#     are configured but invalid.
#   * off (default on non-Linux): Do not attempt to use ACLs.
#   * required: Always use ACLs, produce a hard error at runtime if ACLs
#     are invalid.
acls: try
```

#### `memory`

The `memory` destination type stores artifacts in the process memory. When
the process exits, nothing is persisted. This destination type
is most suitable for ephemeral environments, but can also be used for testing.

Configuration:

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the destination. For the memory destination, this
# will always be `memory`.
type: memory
```

#### `kubernetes_secret`

The `kubernetes_secret` destination type stores artifacts in a Kubernetes
secret. This allows them to be mounted into other containers deployed in
Kubernetes.

Prerequisites:

- `tbot` must be running in Kubernetes with at most one replica. If using a
  `deployment`, then the `Recreate` strategy must be used to ensure only one
  instance exists at any time. This is because multiple `tbot` agents configured
  with the same secret will compete to write to the secret and it may be left
  in an inconsistent state or the `tbot` agents may fail to write.
- The `tbot` pod must be configured with a service account that allows it to
  read and write from the configured secret.
- The `POD_NAMESPACE` environment variable must be configured with the
  name of the namespace that `tbot` is running in. This is best achieved with
  the [Downward API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/).

There is no requirement that the secret already exists, one will be created
if it does not exist. If a secret already exists, `tbot` will overwrite any
other keys within the secret.

Configuration:

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the destination. For the kubernetes_secret
# destination, this will always be `kubernetes_secret`.
type: kubernetes_secret
# name specifies the name of the Kubernetes Secret to write the artifacts to.
# This must be in the same namespace that `tbot` is running in.
name: my-secret
```

## Bot resource

The `bot` resource is used to manage Machine ID Bots. It is used to configure
the access that is granted to a Bot.

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/bot-spec.mdx!)

You can apply a file containing YAML that defines a `bot` resource using
`tctl create -f ./bot.yaml`.
