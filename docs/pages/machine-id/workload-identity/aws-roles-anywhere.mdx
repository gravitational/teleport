title: Configuring Workload ID and AWS Roles Anywhere
description: Configuring AWS to accept Workload ID certificates as authentication using AWS Roles Anywhere
---

Teleport's Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities in X.509
certificates. AWS Roles Anywhere allows you to use these certificates to
authenticate to AWS services.

This can be useful in cases where a machine needs to securely authenticate with
AWS services without the use of a long-lived credential. This is because the
machine can authenticate with Teleport without using any shared secrets by
using one of our delegated join methods.

This implementation differs from Teleport's Application Access for AWS feature
in a few ways:

- Requests to AWS are not proxied through Teleport, meaning reduced latency but
  also less visibility, as these requests will not be recorded in Teleport's
  audit log.
- Workload ID works with any AWS client, including the commandline tool but also
  their SDKs
- Teleport Application Access for AWS does not work with Machine ID and
  therefore cannot be used when a machine needs to authenticate with AWS.

Whilst this guide is primarily aimed at allowing a machine to access AWS,
the `tsh svid issue` command can be used in place of Machine ID to allow a human
user to authenticate with using AWS Roles Anywhere.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
information, see the [deployment guides](../deployment.mdx).

## Step 1/5. Decide on a SPIFFE ID structure

Within Teleport Workload Identity, all identities are represented using a
SPIFFE ID. This is a URI that uniquely identifies the entity that the identity
represents. The scheme is always `spiffe://`, and the host will be the name of
your Teleport cluster. The structure of the path of this URI is up to you.

For the purposes of this guide, we will be granting access to AWS to the
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service` SPIFFE ID.

If you have already deployed Teleport Workload Identity, then you will already
have a SPIFFE ID structure in place. If you have not, then you will need to
decide on a structure for your SPIFFE IDs.

If you are only using Teleport Workload ID with AWS Roles Anywhere, you way
structure your SPIFFE IDs so that they explicitly specify the AWS role they are
allowed to assume. However, it often makes more sense to name the workload or
person that will use the SPIFFE ID. See the
[best practices guide](./best-practices.mdx) for further advice.

## Step 2/5. Configure AWS Roles Anywhere

Configuring AWS Roles Anywhere for the first time involves a few steps. Some
of these may not be necessary if you have previously configured AWS Roles
Anywhere for your Teleport cluster.

### Configure a Roles Anywhere Trust Anchor

If you have previously configured AWS Roles Anywhere for your Teleport cluster,
you can skip this step.

First, we must establish trust between your Teleport cluster and your AWS
Roles Anywhere. This will allow AWS to validate X.509 certificates that are
issued by your Teleport cluster. This is done by configuring the Teleport
cluster's SPIFFE certificate authority as the trust anchor for AWS Roles
Anywhere.

First, you must obtain your Teleport cluster's SPIFFE CA:

```shell
$ tctl auth export --type spiffe
```

Now, navigate to "Roles Anywhere" in the AWS console and click "Create a trust
anchor". You will need to give it a descriptive name, we suggest using the
name of your Teleport cluster with "spiffe" appended.

Select "External certificate bundle" and then paste the output you received
from the `tctl` command into the text box.

You can now click the "Create trust anchor" button.

### Create a Role

Next, we must create a role in AWS for your workload to assume. You may also
modify the trust policy of an existing role if you prefer.

Navigate to the "Roles" section of the AWS IAM console and click "Create role".

For the "Trusted entity type" select "Custom trust policy".

You will now enter the following:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "rolesanywhere.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole",
                "sts:TagSession",
                "sts:SetSourceIdentity"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:PrincipalTag/x509SAN/URI": "spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service"
                },
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:rolesanywhere:us-east-1:12345789:trust-anchor/0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace:

- `spiffe://example.teleport.sh/my-workload` with the SPIFFE ID you have chosen
  for your workload.
- `arn:aws:rolesanywhere:us-east-1:12345789:trust-anchor/0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
  with the ARN of the trust anchor you created in the previous step.

Click "Next" to proceed to the "Add permissions" page. Now select the
permissions you wish to grant to your workload on AWS.

Click "Next" to proceed to the "Name, review, and create" page. Give your role
a descriptive name, e.g "my-workload-roles-anywhere".

Click "Create role".

### Create a Roles Anywhere Profile

Finally, you must create a Roles Anywhere profile.

Navigate back to the "Roles Anywhere" section of the AWS IAM console and click
"Create a profile".

Give your profile a descriptive name, e.g "my-workload".

Select the role you created in the previous step.

Click "Create profile".

## Step 3/5. Configure Teleport RBAC

Now we need to configure Teleport to allow a X.509 certificate to be issued
containing the SPIFFE ID we have chosen.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: my-workload-roles-anywhere
spec:
  allow:
    spiffe:
      - path: "/my-workload"
```

Replace:

- `my-workload-roles-anywhere` with a descriptive name for the role.
- `/my-workload` with the path element of the SPIFFE ID you have chosen for your
  workload.

TODO: Assign role to human or bot...

## Step 4/5. Issue Workload ID certificates

### For machines using `tbot`

### For humans using `tsh`

## Step 5/5. Configure the AWS CLI and SDKs to use Roles Anywhere to authenticate
