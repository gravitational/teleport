<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
Teleport Workload Identity is currently in Preview. We are actively working on
improving the feature and would love to [hear your feedback](mailto: product@goteleport.com).
We currently do not recommend using this feature in production.
</Admonition>

In some scenarios, you may wish to issue a SPIFFE SVID manually, without using
Machine ID. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to impersonate a
service for the purposes of debugging or could provide a mechanism for providing
human access to services which use SPIFFE SVIDs for authentication.

In this guide, you will use the `tsh` tool to issue a SPIFFE SVID.

## Prerequisites

- A role configured to allow issuing SPIFFE SVIDs and this role assigned to
  your user. See [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx) for more information.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

## Step 1/2. Using `tsh` to issue a SPIFFE SVID

First, determine where you wish to write the SPIFFE SVID. If you wish to write
these into a directory, you must first create it. In our example, we will write
the SVID to a directory called `svid`.

Next, determine what SPIFFE ID you wish to issue the SVID for. In our example,
this will be a SPIFFE ID with a path of `/my-svc`.

Issue the SVID specifying the output directory using `--out` and the SPIFFE ID
path as the first argument:

```sh
$ tsh svid issue --out ./svid /my-svc
```

Additionally, flags can be used to further customize the SVID:

| `flag`       | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `--dns-san`  | TODO |
| `--ip-san`   | TODO |
| `--svid-ttl` | TODO |

### Using headless authentication to issue a SVID on a remote host

In some scenarios, you may wish to use `tsh` to issue a SVID on a host you have
SSHed into, without logging into Teleport on that host. This can be particularly
useful in scenarios where authentication may not be possible, for example, when
you authenticate using a hardware token.

In this case, you can use the headless authentication feature of `tsh`. This
provides a prompt for you to authenticate the command on the remote machine,
using your local `tsh` client.

To use headless authentication, we provide the `--headless` flag, and must
also specify the `--proxy` and `--user` flags:

```sh
$ tsh --proxy=example.teleport.sh --user=example --headless svid issue \
  --output . \
  /foo
```
