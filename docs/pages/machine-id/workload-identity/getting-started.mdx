<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
Teleport Workload Identity is currently in Preview. We are actively working on
improving the feature and would love to [hear your feedback](mailto:product@goteleport.com).
We currently do not recommend using this feature in production.

Teleport's Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities intended
for workloads. It is compatible with the industry-standard SPIFFE specification
meaning that it can be used in place of other SPIFFE compatible identity
providers.

In this guide, you'll configure the RBAC necessary to allow a Bot to issue
SPIFFE SVIDs and then configure `tbot` to expose a SPIFFE Workload API endpoint.
You can then connect your workloads to this endpoint to receive SPIFFE SVIDs.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
  workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
  information, see the [deployment guides](../deployment.mdx).

## Step 1/4. Configure RBAC

First, Teleport must be configured to allow the Bot to issue SPIFFE SVIDs.
This is done by configuring a role to allow the issuance of SPIFFE SVIDs and
then granting this role to the Bot.

Before proceeding, you'll want to determine the SPIFFE ID path that your
workload will use. In our example, we'll use `/svc/foo`. We provide more
guidance on choosing a SPIFFE ID structure in the
[Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx) guide.

Create a new file named `spiffe-issuer-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: svid-issuer
spec:
  allow:
    spiffe:
    - path: "/svc/foo"
```

Replace:

- `spiffe-issuer` with a name that describes your use-case.
- `/svc/foo` with the SPIFFE ID path you have decided on issuing.

Use `tctl create -f ./spiffe-issuer-role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example-bot`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and `spiffe-issuer`
with the name of the role you just created:

```bash
$ tctl bots update example-bot --add-roles spiffe-issuer
```

## Step 2/4. Configure `spiffe-workload-api` service in `tbot`

To set up a SPIFFE Workload API endpoint with `tbot`, we configure an instance
of the `spiffe-workload-api` service.

First, determine where you wish this socket to be created. In our example,
we'll use `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock`. You may wish to choose a directory
that is only accessible by the processes that will need to connect to the
Workload API.

Modify your `tbot` configuration file to include the `spiffe-workload-api`
service:

```yaml
services:
- type: spiffe-workload-api
  listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
  svids:
  - path: /svc/foo
    hint: my-hint
```

Replace:

- `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path to the socket you wish to create.
- `/svc/foo` with the SPIFFE ID path you have decided on issuing.
- `my-hint` with a hint that will be included with the SVID. This can help
  workloads identify which SVID they should select if multiple are presented.
  This field can be omitted if not required.

Start or restart your `tbot` instance to apply the new configuration

### Configuring DNS and IP SANs

In some cases, you may wish to configure DNS and IP SANs which should be
included in the SVIDs issued by the Workload API. This is useful in cases
where the client may not be SPIFFE aware and will check the DNS SAN rather than
the SPIFFE URI during the TLS handshake.

These can be configured in the `spiffe-workload-api` service using the `sans`
configuration block:

```yaml
services:
- type: spiffe-workload-api
  listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
  svids:
  - path: /svc/foo
    hint: my-hint
    sans:
      dns:
      - example.com
      ip:
      - 10.0.0.1
```

## Step 3/4. Testing the Workload API with `tbot spiffe-inspect`

The `tbot` binary includes a `spiffe-inspect` command that can be used to
test the configuration of the Workload API. This command will connect to the
Workload API and request SVIDs, whilst providing debug information.

Before configuring your workload to use the Workload API, we recommend using
this command to ensure that the Workload API is behaving as expected.

Use the `spiffe-inspect` command with `--path` to specify the path to the
Workload API socket, replacing `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path you
configured in the previous step:

```bash
$ tbot spiffe-inspect --path unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
INFO [TBOT]      Inspecting SPIFFE Workload API Endpoint unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock tbot/spiffe.go:31
INFO [TBOT]      Received X.509 SVID context from Workload API bundles_count:1 svids_count:1 tbot/spiffe.go:46
SVIDS
- spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/foo
  - Hint: my-hint
  - Expiry: 2024-03-20 10:55:52 +0000 UTC
Trust Bundles
- example.teleport.sh
```

## Step 4/4. Configuring your workload to use the Workload API

Now that you know that the Workload API is behaving as expected, you can
configure your workload to use it. The exact steps will depend on the workload.

In cases where you have used the SPIFFE SDKs, you can configure the
`SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` environment variable to point to the socket created by
`tbot`.

See the [Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx) guide for more information on
integrating SPIFFE with your workloads.
