title: "Running a Production Teleport Cluster"
description: "Guides to running Teleport in production."
---

These guides show you how to run a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise or Teleport
Community Edition cluster in production.

Before deploying a production Teleport cluster on your own infrastructure, you
may want to deploy a demo cluster on a single Linux server by following the
[Linux Demo Cluster](./linux-demo.mdx) guide.

Read our [High Availability Guide](./high-availability.mdx) for the general
principles behind deploying a scalable, fault-tolerant Teleport cluster. Once
you understand what is required to run Teleport in production, choose your
compute platform and cloud provider:

## Deploy on Kubernetes using Helm

You can deploy a complete, high-availability Teleport cluster on Kubernetes
using our `teleport-cluster` Helm chart. These guides show you how to deploy the
`teleport-cluster` Helm chart on your Kubernetes cluster:

- [Google Cloud](./helm-deployments/gcp.mdx)
- [AWS](./helm-deployments/aws.mdx)
- [Azure](./helm-deployments/azure.mdx)
- [DigitalOcean](./helm-deployments/digitalocean.mdx)
- [Standard Kubernetes Deployment](./helm-deployments/kubernetes-cluster.mdx)
- [Custom Kubernetes Deployment](./helm-deployments/custom.mdx)

## Deploy using virtual machines

You can run a production cluster of Teleport instances using virtual machines.
In these guides, we will show you how to deploy a high-availability, VM-based
Teleport cluster on your cloud:

- [AWS High Availability Deployment with Terraform](./deployments/aws-ha-autoscale-cluster-terraform.mdx)
- [AWS Single-Instance Deployment with Terraform](./deployments/aws-starter-cluster-terraform.mdx)
- [AWS Multi-Region Proxy Deployment](./deployments/aws-gslb-proxy-peering-ha-deployment.mdx)
- [Google Cloud](./deployments/gcp.mdx)
- [IBM Cloud](./deployments/ibm.mdx)

## Deploying a multi-region Teleport cluster

The [multi-region Teleport Blueprint](./multi-region-blueprint.mdx) describes
how to build a multi-region Teleport cluster.
