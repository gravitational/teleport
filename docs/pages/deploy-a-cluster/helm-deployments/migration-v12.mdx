title: Migrating to teleport-cluster v12
description: How to upgrade to teleport-cluster Helm chart version 12
---

This guide covers the major changes of the `teleport-cluster` v12 chart
and how to upgrade existing releases from version 11 to version 12.

## Changes summary

The main changes in version 12 of the `teleport-cluster` chart are:

- PodSecurityPolicy has been removed on Kubernetes 1.23 and 1.24
- Teleport now deploys its Auth and Proxy Services as separate pods.
  Running Teleport with this new topology allows it to be more resilient to
  disruptions and scale better.
- Proxies are now deployed as stateless workloads. The `proxy` session recording
  mode uploads recordings asynchronously. Non-uploaded records might be lost
  during rollouts (config changes or version upgrades for example).
  `proxy-sync` ensures consistency and does not have this limitation.
- `custom` mode has been removed as it was broken by the topology change.
  It is replaced by a new configuration override mechanism allowing you to pass
  arbitrary Teleport configuration values.
- The values `standalone.*` that were previously deprecated in favor of `persistence`
  have been removed.
- The chart can now be scaled up in `standalone` mode. Proxy replication requires
  a TLS certificate; Auth replication requires using [HA storage backends](../../reference/backends.mdx).

<Admonition type="warning" title="Version compatibility">
The chart has always been versioned with Teleport but was often compatible with
the previous Teleport major version. This is not the case for v12. Using the chart
v12 requires at least Teleport v12.
</Admonition>

## How to upgrade

If you are running Kubernetes 1.23 and above, follow our
[Kubernetes 1.25 PSP removal guide](./migration-kubernetes-1-25-psp.mdx).

Then, the upgrade path mainly depends on the `chartMode` used. If you used a "managed"
mode like `aws`, `gcp` or `standalone` it should be relatively straightforward.
If you relied on the `custom` chart mode, you will have to perform configuration changes.

Before upgrading, always:

- [backup the cluster content](../../management/operations/backup-restore.mdx),
- test the upgrade in a non-production environment.

<Admonition type="warning">
During the upgrade, Kubernetes will delete existing deployments and create new ones.
**This is not seamless and will cause some downtime** until the new pods are up and all health checks are passing.
This usually takes around 5 minutes.
</Admonition>

### If you use `gcp`, `aws` or `standalone` mode

The upgrade should not require configuration changes. Make sure you don't rely
on `standalone.*` for storage configuration (if you do, switch to using
`persistence` values instead).

Upgrading to v12 will increase the amount of pods deployed as it will deploy auth
and proxies separately. The chart will try to deploy multiple proxy replicas when
possible (proxies can be replicated if certs are provided through a secret or
`cert-manager`). Make sure you have enough room in your Kubernetes cluster to run
the additional Teleport pods:

- `aws` and `gcp` will deploy twice the amount of pods
- `standalone` will deploy 1 or 2 additional pods (depending if the proxy can be replicated)

The additional pods might take more time than before to deploy and become ready.
If you are running helm with `--wait` or `--atomic` make sure to increase your
timeouts to at least 10 minutes.

### If you use `custom` mode

The `custom` mode worked by passing the Teleport configuration through a ConfigMap.
Due to the version 12 topology change, existing `custom` configuration won't work
as-is and will need to be split in two separate configurations: one for the proxies
and one for the auths.

To avoid a surprise breaking upgrade, the `teleport-cluster` v12 chart will refuse
to deploy in `custom` mode and point you to this migration guide.

Version 12 has introduced a new way to pass arbitrary configuration to Teleport
without having to write a full configuration file. If you were using `custom` mode
because of a missing chart feature (like etcd backend support for example) this
might be a better fit for you than managing a fully-custom config.

#### If you deploy a Teleport cluster and only need a couple of custom configuration overrides

You can now use the existing modes `aws`, `gcp` and `standalone` and pass your custom
configuration overrides through the `auth.teleportConfig` and `proxy.teleportConfig`
values. For most use-cases this is the recommended setup as you will automatically
benefit from future configuration upgrades.

For example - a v11 custom configuration that looked like this:

```yaml
teleport:
  log:
    output: stderr
    severity: INFO
auth_service:
  enabled: true
  cluster_name: custom.example.com
  tokens:                                        # This is custom configuration
  - "proxy,node:(=presets.tokens.first=)"
  - "trusted_cluster:(=presets.tokens.second=)"
  listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3025
  public_addr: custom.example.com:3025
proxy_service:
  enabled: true
  listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3080
  public_addr: custom.example.com:443
  ssh_public_addr: ssh-custom.example.com:3023   # This is custom configuration
```

Can be converted into these values:

```yaml
chartMode: standalone
clusterName: custom.example.com

auth:
  teleportConfig:
    auth_service:
      tokens:
        - "proxy,node:(=presets.tokens.first=)"
        - "trusted_cluster:(=presets.tokens.second=)"

proxy:
  teleportConfig:
    proxy_service:
      ssh_public_addr: ssh-custom.example.com:3023
```

<Admonition type="warning">
`teleport.cluster_name` and `teleport.auth_service.authentication.webauthn.rp_id` MUST NOT change.
</Admonition>

#### If you deploy a Teleport cluster and need to manage its full configuration

If you need to manage the full configuration you must use the `scratch` mode.
This mode will generate an empty configuration file and you will pass all your
custom configuration through the `auth.teleportConfig` and `proxy.teleportConfig`
values.

You must split the configuration in two configurations, one for each node type:

- The `proxy` configuration must contain at least the `proxy_service` section
  and the `teleport` section without the `storage` part.
- The `auth` configuration must contain at least the `auth_service` and `teleport` sections.

The chart automatically creates a Kubernetes join token named after the Helm
release, which will enable the proxy pods to seamlessly connect to the auth pods.
If you do not want to use this automatic token, you must provide a valid Teleport
join token in the proxy pods' configuration.

For example - a v11 custom configuration that looked like this:

```yaml
version: v1
teleport:
  log:
    output: stderr
    severity: INFO
auth_service:
  enabled: true
  cluster_name: custom.example.com
  tokens:
  - "proxy,node:(=presets.tokens.first=)"
  - "trusted_cluster:(=presets.tokens.second=)"
  listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3025
  public_addr: custom.example.com:3025
proxy_service:
  enabled: true
  listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3080
  public_addr: custom.example.com:443
  ssh_public_addr: ssh-custom.example.com:3023
```

Can be split into two configurations and be deployed using these values:

```yaml
chartMode: scratch

proxy:
  teleportConfig:
    version: v1
    teleport:
      log:
        output: stderr
        severity: INFO

      # You MUST insert the following block, this tells the proxies
      # how to connect to the auth. The helm chart will automatically create a
      # Kubernetes join token named after the Helm release name so the proxies
      # can join the cluster.
      join_params:
        method: kubernetes
        # The token name pattern is "<RELEASE-NAME>-proxy"
        # Change this if you change the Helm release name.
        token_name: "teleport-proxy"
      # The auth server domain pattern is "<RELEASE-NAME>-auth.<RELEASE-NAMESPACE>.svc.cluster.local:3025"
      # If you change the Helm release name or namespace you must adapt the `auth_server` value.
      auth_server: "teleport-auth.teleport.svc.cluster.local:3025"

    proxy_service:
      enabled: true
      listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3080
      public_addr: custom.example.com:443
      ssh_public_addr: ssh-custom.example.com:3023

auth:
  teleportConfig:
    version: v1
    teleport:
      log:
        output: stderr
        severity: INFO
    auth_service:
      enabled: true
      cluster_name: custom.example.com
      tokens:
      - "proxy,node:(=presets.tokens.first=)"
      - "trusted_cluster:(=presets.tokens.second=)"
      listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3025
      public_addr: custom.example.com:3025
```

#### If you deploy Teleport nodes

If you used the `teleport-cluster` chart in `custom` mode to deploy only services
like `app_service`, `db_service`, `kube_service`, `windows_service` or `discovery_service`,
you should use the `teleport-kube-agent` chart for this purpose.

The chart offers values to configure `app_service`, `kube_service` and `db_service`,
but other services can be configured through the `teleportConfig` value.

To migrate to the `teleport-kube-agent` chart from `teleport-cluster`,
use the following values:

```yaml
proxyAddr: teleport.example.com
# pass the token through joinParams instead of `teleportConfig` so it lives
# in a Kubernetes Secret instead of a ConfigMap
joinParams:
  method: token
  tokenName: (=presets.tokens.first=)

# Roles can be empty if you pass all the configuration through `teleportConfig`
roles: ""

# Put all your previous `teleport.yaml` values except the `teleport` section below
teleportConfig:
  # kubernetes_service:
  #   enabled: true
  #   [...]
  # discovery_service:
  #   enabled: true
  #   [...]
```

## Going further

The new topology allows you to replicate the proxies to increase availability.
You might also want to tune settings like Kubernetes resources or affinities.

By default, each value applies to both `proxy` and `auth` pods, e.g.:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "2GiB"
  limits:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "2GiB"

highAvailability:
  requireAntiAffinity: true
```

But you can scope the value to a specific pod set by nesting it under the `proxy`
or `auth` values. If both the value at the root and a set-specific value are set,
the specific value takes precedence:

```yaml
# By default, all pods use those resources
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "2GiB"
  limits:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "2GiB"

proxy:
  # But the proxy pods have have different resource requests and no cpu limits
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "0.5"
      memory: "1GiB"
    limits:
      cpu: ~  # Generic and specific config are merged: if you want to unset a value, you must do it explicitly
      memory: "1GiB"

auth:
  # Only auth pods will require an anti-affinity
  highAvailability:
    requireAntiAffinity: true
```
