title: "AWS Route 53 GSLB Multi-Region Proxy Peering High Availability Deployment Guide"
description: "Deploying a Proxy-peered High Availability Teleport Cluster using Route 53 to create Global Server Load Balancing"
---

## Overview

This deployment architecture features two important design decisions:

1. AWS Route 53 Latency based routing is used for Global Server Load Balancing 
   [GSLB](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/global-server-load-balancing-gslb/). 
   This allows for efficient distribution of traffic across resources that are globally distributed.

2. Teleport's Proxy Peering is used to reduce the total number of tunnel connections in the Teleport cluster.


This deployment architecture isn’t recommended for use cases where your users or resources are 
clustered in a single region or for Managed Service Providers needing to provide separate clusters 
to customers.

We recommend this for globally distributed resources and end-users that prefer a single point of
entry while also ensuring minimal latency when accessing connected resources.

### Key deployment components
- High Availability Teleport Cluster
- Deployed exclusively in AWS ecosystem
- Auth Servers must remain in a single region
- Proxies are deployed across multiple regions
- [AWS Route 53 latency based routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-latency.html) 
- [GSLB](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/global-server-load-balancing-gslb/)
- [Teleport TLS Routing](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/tls-routing/) to reduce the number of ports needed to use Teleport
- [Teleport Proxy Peering](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/proxy-peering/) for reducing the number of resource connections
- [AWS Network Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html)
- [AWS DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html) for cluster state storage
- [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) for session recording storage

## Advantages of this deployment architecture
- Eliminates the complexity maintaining multiple Teleport clusters across multiple regions
- Uses the lowest latency path to connect users to resources
- Provides a highly-resilient, redundant HA architecture for Teleport that can quickly 
  scale with an organization’s needs.
- All required Teleport components can be provisioned within the AWS ecosystem.
- Using load balancers for the Proxy and Auth services allows for increased availability 
  during Teleport Cluster upgrades. Instances can easily be removed and added while 
  limiting impact to active users.

## Disadvantages of this deployment architecture
- When Teleport Auth servers are limited to a single region, there is a higher likelihood 
  of decreased availability during an AWS regional outage.
- Technically complex to deploy

## AWS Network load balancer (NLB)
AWS NLBs are required for this highly available deployment architecture. 
The NLB forwards traffic from users and services to an available Teleport instance. This must not 
terminate TLS, and must transparently forward the TCP traffic it receives. 
In other words, this must be a Layer 4 load balancer, not a Layer 7 
(e.g., HTTP) load balancer. 

<Admonition

We recommend enabling cross-zone load balancing for the Auth and Proxy service NLB configurations to route 
traffic across multiple zones. Doing this improves resiliency against localized AWS zone outages.
</Admonition>

### Configure the Proxy Service NLBs
Configure the load balancer to forward traffic from the following ports on the
load balancer to the corresponding port on an available Teleport instance. The
configuration depends on whether you route Proxy Peering GRPC traffic over 
the public internet:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Public NLB Proxy ports">

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| `443` | ALPN port for TLS Routing,  HTTPS connections to authenticate `tsh` users into the cluster, and to serve a Web UI |
| `3021`| Proxy Peering gRPC Stream  |

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="VPC peering Proxy NLB ports">

These ports are required:

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| `443` | ALPN port for TLS Routing,  HTTPS connections to authenticate `tsh` users into the cluster, and to serve a Web UI  |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure the Auth Service NLB
Configure the load balancer to forward traffic from the following ports on the
load balancer to the corresponding port on an available Teleport instance.

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Note"

Proxies must have network access to the Auth Service NLB. You can accomplish this
in the Route53 GSLB architecure using [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) 
or [Transit Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html).

Internal NLB Auth Service ports

| Port | Description |
| - | - |
| `3025` | TLS port used by the Auth Service to serve its API to other Nodes in a cluster |

## Cluster state backend

The Teleport Auth Service stores cluster state (such as dynamic configuration
resources) and audit events as key/value pairs. In high-availability
deployments, you must configure the Auth Service to manage this data in a
key-value store that runs outside of your cluster of Teleport instances.

The Teleport Auth Service manages the creation of any required DynamoDB tables itself, 
and does not require them to exist in advance.

<Admonition title="Required permissions">

The Auth Service instances needs permissions to read from and write to DynamoDB, as well as 
to create tables.

</Admonition>

## Session recording backend

Highly available Teleport deployments use an object storage service for
persisting session recordings.

Depending on how you choose to deploy the Teleport cluster, the Teleport Auth Service can create the required S3 bucket if it doesn't already exist.

<Admonition title="Required permissions">

The Auth Service instances need permissions to get S3 buckets as well as to create, get, list, 
and update objects.

</Admonition>

## TLS credential provisioning 

High-availability Teleport deployments require a  system to fetch TLS
credentials from a certificate authority like Let's Encrypt, AWS Certificate
Manager, Digicert, or a trusted internal authority. The system must then
provision Teleport Proxy Service instances with these credentials and renew them
periodically. 

For high-availability deployments that use Let's Encrypt to supply TLS
credentials to Teleport instances running behind a load balancer, you need
to use the [ACME
DNS-01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge)
challenge to demonstrate domain name ownership to Let's Encrypt. In this
challenge, your TLS credential provisioning system creates a DNS TXT record with
a value expected by Let's Encrypt.

Each Teleport Proxy Service instance expects TLS credentials for HTTPS to be available at the file
paths `/etc/teleport-tls/tls.key` (private key) and `/etc/teleport-tls/tls.crt`
(certificate).

## Global Server Load Balancing with Route 53

[Latency-based routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-latency.html) 
in a private hosted zone must be used to ensure traffic from Teleport 
resources are routed to the closest or lowest latency path Proxy NLB based on the region of 
the VPC the resource is connecting from.

To create GSLB routing, create a CNAME record for each region you have VPCs containing Teleport connected resources.
It is recommeded to add a wildcard record for every region if you plan to use Teleport Appplication Access.

The following CNAME record values need to be set:
- **Value:** The domain name of the NLB where example-region-1 located Teleport resource traffic should be routed
- **Routing policy:** Latency
- **Region:** The AWS region from which traffic should be routed to the NLB listed in **Value**
- **Health Check ID:** It is recommended that you set this so that traffic is always routed to a healthy NLB

Example Hosted Zone using AWS Route53 Latency Routing to create GSLB:

### Root GSLB record for Teleport:

|Record name|Type|Value|
|---|---|---|
|```*teleport.example.com```|CNAME|AWS Route 53 nameservers|

### Teleport Proxy DNS records for GSLB:
|Record name|Type|Routing Policy|Region|Value|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|```teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|us-west-1| ```elb.us-west-1.amazonaws.com``` |
|```*.teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|us-west-1| ```elb.us-west-1.amazonaws.com``` |
|```teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|eu-central-1| ```elb.eu_central-1.amazonaws.com```|
|```*.teleport.example.com```|CNAME|Latency|eu-central-1| ```elb.eu_central-1.amazonaws.com```|

<Admonition title="Required permissions">

If you are using Let's Encrypt to provide TLS credentials to your Teleport
instances, the TLS credential system we mentioned earlier needs permissions to
manage Route53 DNS records in order to satisfy Let's Encrypt's DNS-01 challenge. 

</Admonition>

### Teleport resource agent configuration for GSLB
To facilitate latency routing, resource agents  must be configured to point ```proxy_server:``` to 
the GSLB domain configured in Route53 _not the specific proxy NLB address_.

For example:

```
teleport:
    nodename: ssh-node
    ...
    proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
    ...
    ssh_service:
        enabled: yes
    ...
```
Review the [configuration reference](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/config/) page for 
additional settings.       

## Configure Proxy Peering

In this deployment architecure, [Proxy Peering](https://goteleport.com/docs/architecture/proxy-peering/) is used to restrict the number of connections made from 
resources to proxies in the Teleport Cluster.

This guide covers the necessary Proxy Peering settings for deploying an HA Teleport Cluster routing resource
traffic with GSLB. 

### Auth Service Proxy Peering configuration 

The Teleport Auth Service must be configured to use the proxy_peering tunnel strategy as shown in the example below:

```
auth_service:
 ...
 tunnel_strategy:
  type: proxy_peering
```
Reference the [Auth Server configuration](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/config/#auth-service) reference page 
for additional settings.

### Proxy Service Proxy Peering configuration 

Proxies must advertise a peer address which can be configured to use one of the two options listed below:

**Option 1:** You can set peer_public_addr: to the specific name of that proxy. This is the recommended 
method for lowest latency and most reliable connection.

```
proxy_service:
  ...
  peer_public_addr: teleport.example.com:3021
  ...
```

**Option 2:** Proxies can use peer_public_addr: to advertise the proxy NLB. When using this method 
you could incur additional latency or user experience issues because peer proxies must continually dial through the NLB until 
they establish connection to the correct peer target.

When using an NLB for peer_public_addr, be sure to set agent_connection_count to a value >=2.

```
proxy_service:
  ...
  peer_public_addr: teleport-example-nlb-us-east-1.amazonaws.com:3021
  agent_connection_count: 2
  ...
```
Refrence the [Proxy Service configuration](https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/config/#proxy-service) reference page 
for additional settings.
