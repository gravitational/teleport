Teleport is the easiest and most secure way to access and protect all your
infrastructure.

The Teleport Access Platform is a suite of software and managed services that
delivers on-demand, least-privileged access to infrastructure on a foundation of
cryptographic identity and Zero Trust, with built-in identity security and
policy governance.

## Use cases

Organizations use the Teleport Access Platform to:

- **Eliminate infrastructure and access silos:** Teleport provides a single
  system for role-based access controls, audit, and access for all of your
  infrastructure, from cloud provider APIs to Kubernetes clusters.
- **Introduce Zero Trust with theft-resistant credentials:** Teleport
  authenticates access to all of your infrastructure with short-lived
  certificates, verified at every endpoint. You can roll out a Zero Trust
  strategy for your organization by setting up Teleport alone.
- **Address complex compliance needs:** Teleport allows you to satisfy
  compliance frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP with no need for additional
  tooling or process changes. 

## Products

The Teleport Access Platform consists of three products:

- **Teleport Access** provides on-demand, least privileged access, on a
  foundation of cryptographic identity and Zero Trust.
- **Teleport Identity** hardens your infrastructure with identity governance and
  security.
- **Teleport Policy** unifies and controls access policies across all of your
  infrastructure.  

### Teleport Access

**Teleport Access** provides Zero Trust connectivity to all of your
infrastructure. You can enable users to access servers, databases, and other
infrastructure components over the public internet, even if those components are
protected behind a firewall. 

All infrastructure resources belong to a unified inventory, with a single
role-based access controls system to allow for least-privilege access. You can
enable users to authenticate to resources using Single Sign-On providers like
Okta, and Teleport itself can act as an identity provider for external services.
Connectivity takes place through short-lived credentials that Teleport
components verify through strong cryptographic techniques.

Get started with Teleport Access:

- [Enroll resources](enroll-resources/agents/introduction.mdx) to protect with Teleport using
  cryptographic identity.
- [Set up passwordless authentication](admin-guides/access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx)
  to enable users to access resources with hardware keys, including biometric
  credentials like Touch ID and YubiKey Bio.
- [Integrate your Single Sign-On provider](admin-guides/access-controls/sso/sso.mdx): Allow users
  to access infrastructure resources with IdPs like Okta.
- [Use Teleport as an identity provider](admin-guides/access-controls/idps/saml-guide.mdx) to
  authenticate to external services.
- [Issue and govern identities for automated
  systems](machine-workload-identity/machine-id/introduction.mdx) using Machine ID.

### Teleport Identity

**Teleport Identity** is an add-on to Teleport Access that offers identity
governance and security for all of your infrastructure. You can provide users
with less-privileged roles by default, requiring any user who wants additional
permissions to request them for a limited time. This approach leaves no
permanent admin roles for attackers to target. 

As an additional layer of protection against phishing and exfiltration, you can
restrict access to users with trusted devices. And during active security
incidents, you can lock down specific users, roles, infrastructure resources and
more, letting you contain the security incident with minimal disruption. An
audit log provides visibility into access patterns, so you can identify weak
restrictions and potential security breaches.

Get started with Teleport Identity:

- [Access Requests](identity-governance/access-requests/access-requests.mdx): Temporarily
  provision minimal privileges to complete a task.
- [Access Lists](identity-governance/access-lists/access-lists.mdx): Regularly audit and
  control membership to specific roles and traits, which then tie easily back
  into Teleport's existing RBAC system.
- [Device Trust](identity-governance/device-trust/device-trust.mdx): Require an up-to-date,
  registered device for each authentication by giving every device a
  cryptographic identity. 
- [Session & Identity Locks](identity-governance/locking.mdx): Lock
  suspicious or compromised identities and stop all their activity across all
  protocols and services.
- [Access Monitoring](identity-governance/access-monitoring.mdx): Detect overly
  broad privileges and inspect sessions that are not using strong protection,
  such as multi-factor authentication and Device Trust.

### Teleport Policy

**Teleport Policy** unifies and controls access policies across all your
infrastructure. With Teleport Policy’s Access Graph feature, you gain insights
into role-based access control policies within Teleport, your cloud providers,
and critical infrastructure.

- Get started with [Teleport
  Policy](identity-security/teleport-policy.mdx).
- Define [Crown Jewels](identity-security/crown-jewels.mdx) so you
  can track changes to your most sensitive users and resources.
- Enable [Teleport Policy
  integrations](identity-security/integrations/integrations.mdx) so
  you can identify [insecure SSH key
  distributions](identity-security/integrations/ssh-keys-scan.mdx), and
  import RBAC rules from AWS, Entra ID, and other sources to visualize your
  entire RBAC configuration in on a single screen. 

## Architecture

The Teleport Access Platform consists of a certificate authority and
identity-aware access proxy that run either on the Teleport-managed cloud or, in
special cases, a self-hosted private network. 

Teleport Agents, which can run on Linux servers or Kubernetes, proxy access to
infrastructure resources and cloud provider APIs. Users authenticate to
infrastructure resources through Teleport Agents using short-lived certificates.
Certificates embed Teleport user attributes, allowing Teleport Agents to enforce
role-based access controls.
