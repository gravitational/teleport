Teleport is the easiest, most secure way to access and protect all your infrastructure.

The Teleport Infrastructure Identity Platform implements trusted computing at
scale, with unified cryptographic identities for humans, machines and workloads,
endpoints, infrastructure assets, and AI agents. 

## Get started

You can quickly see how Teleport works by following our [Get
Started](./get-started.mdx) guide to enroll your first resource with Teleport.

## Architecture

The Teleport Infrastructure Identity Platform consists of a certificate authority and
identity-aware access proxy that run either on the Teleport-managed cloud or, in
special cases, a self-hosted private network. 

Teleport Agents, which can run on Linux servers or Kubernetes, proxy access to
infrastructure resources and cloud provider APIs. Users authenticate to
infrastructure resources through Teleport Agents using short-lived certificates.
Teleport Agents enforce role-based access controls by using certificates that embed user attributes.
