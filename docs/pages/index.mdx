Teleport is a certificate authority and access plane for your infrastructure.
With Teleport you can:

- Use a single solution to access your SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters,
  databases, desktops, and web applications. 
- Define sophisticated access policies for every component of your infrastructure, with fine-grained audit logs and session recordings.
- Automatically on– and off-board users via integrations with single sign-on
  providers like GitHub, Okta, and Google Workspace.
