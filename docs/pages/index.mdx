Teleport is the easiest and most secure way to access and protect all your
infrastructure.

The Teleport Access Platform is a suite of software and managed services that
delivers on-demand, least-privileged access to infrastructure on a foundation of
cryptographic identity and Zero Trust, with built-in identity security and
policy governance.

## Use cases

Organizations use the Teleport Access Platform to:

- **Eliminate infrastructure and access silos:** Teleport provides a single
  system for role-based access controls, audit, and access for all of your
  infrastructure, from cloud provider APIs to Kubernetes clusters.
- **Introduce Zero Trust with theft-resistant credentials:** Teleport
  authenticates access to all of your infrastructure with short-lived
  certificates, verified at every endpoint. You can roll out a Zero Trust
  strategy for your organization by setting up Teleport alone.
- **Address complex compliance needs:** Teleport allows you to satisfy
  compliance frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and FedRAMP with no need for additional
  tooling or process changes.

## Architecture

The Teleport Access Platform consists of a certificate authority and
identity-aware access proxy that run either on the Teleport-managed cloud or, in
special cases, a self-hosted private network. 

Teleport Agents, which can run on Linux servers or Kubernetes, proxy access to
infrastructure resources and cloud provider APIs. Users authenticate to
infrastructure resources through Teleport Agents using short-lived certificates.
Certificates embed Teleport user attributes, allowing Teleport Agents to enforce
role-based access controls.
