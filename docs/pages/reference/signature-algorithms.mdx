The Teleport Auth Service issues SSH and TLS certificates to users and hosts
that allow all connections to be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted.
This page describes the cryptographic signature algorithms used to sign each
kind of certificate issued by Teleport.

Continue reading to learn how to:

- configure a Teleport cluster created before Teleport 17 to use fast and secure
  elliptic-curve keys
- configure your cluster to use FIPS-compatible signature algorithms
- configure your cluster to use signature algorithms compatible with your HSM or KMS.

## Signature algorithm suites

New Teleport clusters created after Teleport 17 will automatically use
elliptic-curve keys in most cases.
If you created your cluster on an older version of Teleport it will continue to
use RSA keys until you opt in to the new algorithms by configuring a **signature
algorithm suite**.
By selecting a single algorithm suite, you can control all of the cryptographic
signature algorithms used across your cluster.

### `legacy`

The `legacy` suite identifies the original Teleport behavior where all
signatures are based on 2048-bit RSA keys.
Teleport clusters created on versions prior to 17.0.0 effectively have always
used the `legacy` suite and this will not automatically change when they upgrade
to newer versions.

We recommend that users upgrade to one of the newer suites when they are able.

### `balanced-v1`

The `balanced-v1` suite is the default suite for self-hosted clusters created
after version 17.0.0.
It is our recommended suite for most self-hosted users.
When this suite is configured, Ed25519 is used for all SSH certificates and
ECDSA with the NIST P-256 curve is used for all TLS certificates.

RSA is still used where compatibility with common third-party software that
Teleport integrates with is known to be unable to support non-RSA algorithms.
This includes certificates issued by the `db` or `db_client` CAs and certain
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that are issued by Teleport.

### `fips-v1`

Users deploying Teleport in FIPS mode are recommended to use the `fips-v1`
suite.
New clusters created after version 17.0.0 in FIPS mode will use this suite by
default.

FIPS 186-5 only added approval for Ed25519 relatively recently (in February 2023)
and there is some nuance to how the algorithm can be used.
More importantly for Teleport, the `boringcrypto` module our FIPS Go binaries are
compiled with does not yet support Ed25519.
For these reasons, the `fips-v1` suite is based on the `balanced-v1` suite but
replaces all uses of Ed25519 with ECDSA.

Using the `fips-v1` suite with an HSM or KMS configured is fully supported.

### `hsm-v1`

The `hsm-v1` suite is designed for Cloud customers and self-hosted users that
have opted in to keeping their Certificate Authority key material in an HSM or KMS.
It is the default suite for new clusters created after version 17.0.0 that have
an HSM or KMS configured.
It will be the default suite for new Teleport Cloud clusters on version 17.x+.

Teleport's integration with PKCS#11 HSMs and cloud KMSs does not yet support
Ed25519.
For this reason, the `hsm-v1` suite is based on the `balanced-v1` suite but uses
ECDSA in place of Ed25519 for all Certificate Authority keys.
User and host SSH keys still use Ed25519.

If you deploy Teleport in FIPS mode the `hsm-v1` suite is not compatible, you
should use the `fips-v1` suite instead.
The main difference between the two suites is that the `hsm-v1` suite still uses
Ed25519 for user and host SSH keys, while the `fips-v1` suite does not use
Ed25519 at all.

## Configuration

The cluster signature algorithm suite can be configured statically in the Auth Service
configuration file or dynamically in the `cluster_auth_preference` resource.

### Static configuration

Add the following to your Teleport Auth Service configuration file, which is stored in
`/etc/teleport.yaml` by default.

  ```yaml
  auth_service:
    authentication:
      signature_algorithm_suite: "balanced-v1"
  ```

### Dynamic resource

Edit your `cluster_auth_preference` resource:

```code
$ tctl edit cap
```

Ensure that the resource includes the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  signature_algorithm_suite: "balanced-v1"
version: v2
```

## Certificate Authorities

The `tctl status` command will display the status of each of your Teleport
cluster's Certificate Authorities, including the algorithm used for each key pair.

```code
$ tctl status
Cluster: example.teleport.sh
Version: 17.0.0
CA pins: sha256:b1419d94442b2b1ba70f967157bf177c7605020c59ee93a10b0e4d3fc526e7df

openssh   standby (never rotated) SSH      active Ed25519     software
jwt       standby (never rotated) JWT      active ECDSA P-256 software
saml_idp  standby (never rotated) TLS      active RSA 2048    software
oidc_idp  standby (never rotated) JWT      active RSA 2048    software
spiffe    standby (never rotated) JWT      active RSA 2048    software
                                  TLS      active ECDSA P-256 software
okta      standby (never rotated) JWT      active ECDSA P-256 software
```

Each certificate authority is automatically generated the first time your Auth
Service starts up when you create a new Teleport cluster.
If you change your cluster's signature algorithm suite after the cluster has
already been created, new user and host keys will use the new algorithms, but
the key material of each Certificate Authority will not automatically be
updated.

In order to use new signature algorithms for your existing Certificate
Authorities, you will need to complete a CA rotation for each authority.
This may require manual steps to update the trust relationships in your Cluster.
The procedure is documented in the [CA rotation guide](../admin-guides/management/operations/ca-rotation.mdx).
This process is optional, your cluster will continue to function with the
existing Certificate Authority keys if you don't complete a CA rotation.

## Algorithms

The following table lists the key algorithm used for each key Teleport generates
in each suite.

## FAQ

### What if my use-case doesn't support the new algorithms?

Try it and let us know!
We aim to balance security, performance, and compatibility with the chosen
signature algorithm suites.
It is okay to continue using the `legacy` suite for the foreseeable future and we
expect it may be required for some users' environments.

### How did you choose these algorithms?

Ed25519 is a modern, fast, secure algorithm with small keys that has become the
de-facto standard for new SSH keys.
It is our preference in cases where it is compatible with everything Teleport
needs to interact with.

ECDSA with the NIST P-256 curve is widely used and supported for TLS and we use
it in cases where there is not good support for Ed25519.
It has similar speed and security properties to Ed25519.

We only continue to use RSA where we interact with third-party software that
does not support Ed25519 or ECDSA.

### Why can't I pick a specific algorithm for a specific Teleport cert?

The signature algorithm suites are designed to simplify the configuration burden.
We did not want to expose 100 configuration knobs to modify every single
signature Teleport does, which could lead to thousands of possible combinations
we'd have to support, and could create the possibility for insecure combinations.

### What if my HSM doesn't support ECDSA keys?

If you are using a PKCS#11 HSM that does not support ECDSA keys, we recommend
you continue to use the `legacy` algorithm suite.

If you have a strong need to have users and hosts use Ed25519 and/or ECDSA keys,
you could switch to the `hsm-v1` suite, but whenever a new CA key is generated
it may fail if the CA uses non-RSA keys.
This may cause the Auth Service to terminate with an error after trying to
generate the key.
New CA keys may be generated the first time a new Auth Service starts, when a CA
rotation is initiated, or during a version upgrade when a new CA has been added
in the new version.
For these reasons we recommend continuing to use the `legacy` algorithm suite.

### My YubiHSM2 authentication key does not have capabilities for ECDSA keys, what do I do?

Our [YubiHSM2 guide](../admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/hsm.mdx) recommends
creating an
[authentication key](https://docs.yubico.com/hardware/yubihsm-2/hsm-2-user-guide/hsm2-core-concepts.html#authentication-key)
to be used by the Teleport Auth Service to authenticate with the YubiHSM2.
The example in the original version of that guide created an authentication key
without the necessary
[capabilities](https://docs.yubico.com/hardware/yubihsm-2/hsm-2-user-guide/hsm2-core-concepts.html#capability)
to create and sign with ECDSA keys.
Before upgrading to v17 and/or switching your algorithm suite, we recommend
creating a new authentication key with the necessary capabilities and updating
your Auth Service configuration to use the new key.
The new authentication key will still be able to use your existing CA keys.

To create a new authentication key with `yubihsm-shell`:
```text
$ yubihsm-shell
Using default connector URL: http://localhost:12345
yubihsm> connect
Session keepalive set up to run every 15 seconds

# Open a session with an admin authentication key that has capabilities to create
# new authentication keys. The factory default authentication key has id:1 and
# password:password. Use the appropriate ID and password if you have changed
# these parameters.
yubihsm> session open 1
Enter password:
Created session 0

# Create a new authentication key for Teleport.
yubihsm> put authkey 0 0 "New Teleport Auth Key" 1 generate-asymmetric-key:sign-pkcs:sign-pss:sign-ecdsa:delete-asymmetric-key sign-pkcs:sign-pss:decrypt-pkcs:decrypt-oaep:sign-ecdsa
Enter password:
Stored Authentication key 0x1a92

# Make sure you can open a session with the new authentication key and password
yubihsm> session open 0x1a92
Enter password:
Created session 1
```

Update `auth_service.ca_key_params.pkcs11.pin` or the file referenced by
`auth_service.ca_key_params.pkcs11.pin_path` to use the ID of the new
authentication key, then restart the Auth Service.

### What if I use an HSM and FIPS mode?

If you use Teleport in FIPS mode and you use an HSM or KMS for CA key storage,
the supported signature algorithms suites are `fips-v1` and legacy.
We recommend using the `fips-v1` suite.
