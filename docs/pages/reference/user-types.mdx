This guide explains the different kinds of users in Teleport, how they are
created, and their properties.

## Local users

Local users are created in Teleport. They are not coming from an
external system like an identity provider.

Local users can be created via the CLI (`tctl users add`), by applying a user
resource manifest (`tctl create -f user.yaml`) or via the web UI. Their roles
and traits can be modified directly in Teleport.

Those users can connect to Teleport directly via username/password and/or
additional authentication factors such as WebAuthn physical tokens, passkeys, or
one-time passwords.

Local user login can be disabled via `cluster_auth_preference` or `teleport.yaml`.
Disabling local authentication is required for [FIPS/FedRAMP compliance
](../admin-guides/access-controls/compliance-frameworks/fedramp.mdx).

### Special case: Bots

Machine ID provides machines with an identity that can authenticate to the
Teleport cluster. This identity is known as a bot. Bots are represented in
Teleport by a user and a role resource and can be created via the
`tctl bots add` command.

Unlike human users, who use a password, MFA, or SSO, bot users join
the cluster as Teleport services using [a join method](./join-methods.mdx). They
can still join even if local auth is disabled. 

See the [Machine ID introduction](../enroll-resources/machine-id/introduction.mdx) for more information.

## SSO users

Single Sign-On (SSO) users are imported in Teleport from an external identity provider.
Teleport contains a user resource representing those users, but it's only a
representation of a user of a remote system.

Remote users don't perform their login challenge in Teleport. They are redirected
to their identity provider (IdP) to enter their password, MFA, or any
authentication method required by the upstream SSO provider. Teleport is not
aware of the authentication method not the user credentials, it trusts the IdP
response.

If `teleport.auth_service.authentication.second_factors` is `["webauthn"]`, Teleport
might ask for an additional MFA for administrative actions. This protects
against IdP compromise.

SSO users cannot be edited via `tctl`, or via any other IaC tooling like
Terraform or the Teleport Kubernetes Operator. They are managed by Teleport.

### Temporary users

Users logging in via GitHub, SAML, or OIDC connectors are created in Teleport
after a successful login. At that time, their roles and traits are computed
according to the connector mappings.

Those users are short-lived: they are created when a Teleport session is opened
and automatically expire. The expiry is dynamically computed based on the IdP
answer validity, the max session duration allowed by the user roles, and cannot
exceed 30 hours. Those users cannot be edited via `tctl`, only deleted.

See the [SSO setup guides](../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/sso.mdx) to learn how to setup an
authentication connector and allow user to log in via an IdP.

### Synced users

Since version 15, Teleport supports fetching users from external identity
providers like Okta.

Synchronizing users from the external IdP allows all users to be represented in
Teleport, whether they logged in Teleport or not. The benefits of such
integration are:
- Automatic user locking and deletion if the user is suspended or removed in the
  IdP.
- Ability to see all users within Teleport regardless of the last login date.
- All IdP users are displayed in Teleport Teleport Identity Security's Access Graph.

The Okta synchronization service is in charge of creating new users when they
are created in Okta, and locking/deleting users if they get deactivated/removed
in Okta.

Those users can be identified by the label `teleport.dev/origin: okta` and
cannot be edited via `tctl`, only deleted.
