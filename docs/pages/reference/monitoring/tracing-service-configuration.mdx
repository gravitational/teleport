This guide lays out the configuration fields that are related to distributed
tracing in Teleport. You can find these fields in the Teleport configuration
file, which is `teleport.yaml` by default:

```yaml
# Main service responsible for Distributed Tracing.
#
# You must enable the Tracing Service once per teleport.yaml for all
# agents that you wish to capture traces from,
(!docs/pages/includes/diagnostics/tracing-config.yaml!)
```
