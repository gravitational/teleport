Represents the revocation of a single X509 workload identity credential. Creating or deleting these resources triggers the regeneration of the trust domain CRL.  The name of a WorkloadIdentityX509Revocation must be the base16, lower case, encoded serial number of the revoked X509 certificate. Therefore, only a single revocation entry can exist for a given certificate.
