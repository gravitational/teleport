title: tctl Resource References
description: Provides comprehensive reference documentation for dynamic resources that you can manage with tctl.
---

The `tctl` client tool allows cluster administrators to manage Teleport dynamic
resources using YAML manifests. The guides in this section of the documentation
include comprehensive lists of fields for resources you can manage with `tctl`.

## Getting started with `tctl`

For guidance on using `tctl` to manage the dynamic resources that you would
typically see in a Teleport cluster, such as roles and users, see [Managing
Resources](../../zero-trust-access/infrastructure-as-code/managing-resources/managing-resources.mdx).

## Selecting a reference guide

The `tctl` resource reference guides are organized by resource version. Select a
resource version from the sidebar to view supported fields.
