**Kind**: recovery_codes
**Version**: v1

RecoveryCodes holds a user's recovery code information. Recovery codes allows users to regain access to their account by restoring their lost password or multi-factor. Once a recovery code is successfully verified, the code is mark used (which invalidates it), and lets the user begin the recovery flow. When a user successfully finishes the recovery flow, users will get a new set of codes that will replace all the previous ones.

Example:

```yaml
kind: "string"
