A BotInstance

Example:

```yaml
kind: "string"
sub_kind: "string"
version: "string"
metadata: # See description
spec: # [...]
status: # [...]
```
|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|version|The version of the resource being represented.|string|
|sub_kind|Differentiates variations of the same kind. All resources should contain one, even if it is never populated.|string|
|status|Fields that are set by the server as results of operations. These should not be modified by users.|[Bot Instance Status](#bot-instance-status)|
|spec|The configured properties of a BotInstance.|[Bot Instance Spec](#bot-instance-spec)|
|metadata|Common metadata that all resources share.||
|kind|The kind of resource represented.|string|

## Bot Instance Spec

Contains fields


Example:

```yaml
bot_name: "string"
instance_id: "string"
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|instance_id|The unique identifier for this instance.|string|
|bot_name|The name of the bot associated with this instance.|string|

## Bot Instance Status

Holds the status of a BotInstance.


Example:

```yaml
initial_authentication: # [...]
latest_authentications: 
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
initial_heartbeat: # [...]
latest_heartbeats: 
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|latest_heartbeats|The N most recent heartbeats for this bot instance.|[][Bot Instance Status Heartbeat](#bot-instance-status-heartbeat)|
|latest_authentications|The N most recent authentication status records for this bot instance.|[][Bot Instance Status Authentication](#bot-instance-status-authentication)|
|initial_heartbeat|The initial heartbeat status for this bot instance.|[Bot Instance Status Heartbeat](#bot-instance-status-heartbeat)|
|initial_authentication|The initial authentication status for this bot instance.|[Bot Instance Status Authentication](#bot-instance-status-authentication)|

## Bot Instance Status Authentication

Contains information about a join or renewal. Ths information is entirely sourced by the Auth Server and can be trusted.


Example:

```yaml
authenticated_at: # See description
join_method: "string"
join_token: "string"
metadata: # See description
generation: 1
public_key: BASE64_STRING
join_attrs: # See description
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|public_key|The public key of the Bot instance. This must be a PEM wrapped, PKIX DER encoded public key. This provides consistency and supports multiple types of public key algorithm.|base64-encoded string|
|metadata|The metadata sourced from the join method. Deprecated: prefer using join_attrs.||
|join_token|The join token used for this join or renewal. This is only populated for delegated join methods as the value for `token` join methods is sensitive. Deprecated: prefer using join_attrs.meta.join_token_name|string|
|join_method|The join method used for this join or renewal. Deprecated: prefer using join_attrs.meta.join_method|string|
|join_attrs|The attributes generated during the join process. Typically, this is information from the join attestation process itself. This field will eventually replace the `metadata` field, which is structureless.||
|generation|On each renewal, this generation is incremented. For delegated join methods, this counter is not checked during renewal. For the `token` join method, this counter is checked during renewal and the Bot is locked out if the counter in the certificate does not match the counter of the last authentication.|number|
|authenticated_at|The timestamp that the join or renewal was authenticated by the Auth Server.||

## Bot Instance Status Heartbeat

Contains information self-reported by an instance of a Bot. This information is not verified by the server and should not be trusted.


Example:

```yaml
recorded_at: # See description
is_startup: true
version: "string"
hostname: "string"
uptime: # See description
join_method: "string"
one_shot: true
architecture: "string"
os: "string"
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|version|The version of `tbot` that submitted this heartbeat.|string|
|uptime|The duration that `tbot` has been running for when it submitted this heartbeat.||
|recorded_at|The timestamp that the heartbeat was recorded by the Auth Server. Any value submitted by `tbot` for this field will be ignored.||
|os|The OS of the host that `tbot` is running on, determined by runtime.GOOS.|string|
|one_shot|Indicates whether `tbot` is running in one-shot mode.|Boolean|
|join_method|The currently configured join_method.|string|
|is_startup|Indicates whether this is the heartbeat submitted by `tbot` on startup.|Boolean|
|hostname|The hostname of the host that `tbot` is running on.|string|
|architecture|The architecture of the host that `tbot` is running on, determined by runtime.GOARCH.|string|
