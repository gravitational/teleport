AccessRequest represents an Access Request resource specification

Example:

```yaml

spec: # [...]
```
|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|version|Version|string|
|sub_kind|An optional resource sub kind, used in some resources|string|
|spec|An AccessRequest specification|[Access Request Spec](#access-request-spec)|
|metadata|AccessRequest metadata|[Metadata](#metadata)|
|kind|A resource kind|string|

## Access Request Spec

AccessRequestSpec is the specification for AccessRequest


Example:

```yaml
user: "string"
roles: 
  - "string"
  - "string"
  - "string"
state: # [...]
created: # See description
expires: # See description
request_reason: "string"
resolve_reason: "string"
resolve_annotations: # [...]
system_annotations: # [...]
thresholds: 
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
rtm: 
  "string": # [...]
  "string": # [...]
  "string": # [...]
reviews: 
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
suggested_reviewers: 
  - "string"
  - "string"
  - "string"
resource_ids: 
  - # [...]

login_hint: "string"
dry_run: true
max_duration: # See description
session_ttl: # See description
access_list: # [...]
assume_start_time: # See description
expiry: # See description
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|user|The name of the user to whom the roles will be applied.|string|
|thresholds|A list of review thresholds relevant to this request.  Order must be preserved, as thresholds are referenced by index (internal use only).|[][Access Review Threshold](#access-review-threshold)|
|system_annotations|A set of programmatically generated annotations attached to pending Access Requests by teleport.  These annotations are generated by applying variable interpolation to the RoleConditions.Request.Annotations block of a user's role(s).  These annotations serve as a mechanism for administrators to pass extra information to plugins when they process pending Access Requests.|[Traits](#traits)|
|suggested_reviewers|A list of reviewer suggestions.  These can be teleport usernames, but that is not a requirement.|[]string|
|state|The current state of this Access Request.|[Request State](#request-state)|
|session_ttl|SessionTLL indicated how long a certificate for a session should be valid for.||
|rtm|Encodes the relationship between the requested roles and the review threshold requirements for the given role (internal use only). By storing a representation of which thresholds must pass for each requested role, we both eliminate the need to cache the requestor's roles directly, and allow future versions of teleport to become smarter about calculating more granular requirements in a backwards-compatible manner (i.e. calculation can become smarter in minor releases). Storing this relationship on the request is necessary in order to avoid unexpected or inconsistent behavior due to review submission timing.|map[string][Threshold Index Sets](#threshold-index-sets)|
|roles|The name of the roles being requested.|[]string|
|reviews|A list of reviews applied to this request (internal use only).|[][Access Review](#access-review)|
|resource_ids|A set of resources to which access is being requested.|[][Resource ID](#resource-id)|
|resolve_reason|An optional message explaining the reason for the resolution of the request (approval, denial, etc...).|string|
|resolve_annotations|A set of arbitrary values received from plugins or other resolving parties during approval/denial.  Importantly, these annotations are included in the access_request.update event, allowing plugins to propagate arbitrary structured data to the audit log.|[Traits](#traits)|
|request_reason|An optional message explaining the reason for the request.|string|
|max_duration|Indicates how long the access should be granted for.||
|login_hint|Used as a hint for search-based Access Requests to select roles based on the login the user is attempting.|string|
|expiry|The time at which the access request resource will expire.||
|expires|Constrains the maximum lifetime of any login session for which this request is active.||
|dry_run|Indicates that the request should not actually be created, the Auth Service should only validate the Access Request.|Boolean|
|created|Encodes the time at which the request was registered with the auth server.||
|assume_start_time|The time the requested roles can be assumed.||
|access_list|PromotedAccessListTitle is the title of the access list that this request was promoted to. Used by WebUI to display the title of the access list. This field is only populated when the request is in the PROMOTED state.|[Promoted Access List](#promoted-access-list)|

## Access Review

A review to be applied to an Access Request.


Example:

```yaml
author: "string"
roles: 
  - "string"
  - "string"
  - "string"
proposed_state: # [...]
reason: "string"
created: # See description
annotations: # [...]
i: 
  - 1
  - 1
  - 1
access_list: # [...]
assume_start_time: # See description
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|roles|A list used for role-subselection (not yet fully supported).|[]string|
|reason|An optional human-readable reason for why the above state is being proposed.|string|
|proposed_state|The proposed state (must be APPROVED or DENIED).|[Request State](#request-state)|
|i|Stores the indexes of thresholds which this review matches (internal use only).|[]number|
|created|The time at which the review was created.||
|author|The teleport username of the review author.|string|
|assume_start_time|The time the requested roles can be assumed.||
|annotations|The proposed value of the request's resolve_annotations field.|[Traits](#traits)|
|access_list|The access list that this request was promoted to. This field is only populated when the request is in the PROMOTED state.|[Promoted Access List](#promoted-access-list)|

## Access Review Threshold

Describes a filter used to match access reviews, as well as approval/denial counts which trigger state-transitions.  This type can be used to describe policies such as "can be approved by 2 admins" or "can be denied by any non-contractor".


Example:

```yaml
name: "string"
filter: "string"
approve: 1
deny: 1
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|name|The optional human-readable name of the threshold.|string|
|filter|An optional predicate used to determine which reviews count toward this threshold.|string|
|deny|The number of denials needed for state-transition.|number|
|approve|The number of matching approvals needed for state-transition.|number|

## Metadata

Resource metadata


Example:

```yaml
name: "string"
description: "string"
labels: 
  "string": "string"
  "string": "string"
  "string": "string"
expires: # See description
revision: "string"
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|revision|An opaque identifier which tracks the versions of a resource over time. Clients should ignore and not alter its value but must return the revision in any updates of a resource.|string|
|name|An object name|string|
|labels|A set of labels|map[string]string|
|expires|A global expiry time header can be set on any resource in the system.||
|description|Object description|string|

## Promoted Access List

A minimal access list representation used for promoting Access Requests to access lists.


Example:

```yaml
name: "string"
title: "string"
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|title|The title of the access list.|string|
|name|The name of the access list.|string|

## Request State

Represents the state of a request for escalated privilege.


## Resource ID

A unique identifier for a teleport resource. Must be kept in sync with teleport.decision.v1alpha1.ResourceId.


Example:

```yaml
cluster: "string"
kind: "string"
name: "string"
sub_resource: "string"
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|sub_resource|The resource belonging to resource identified by "Name" that the user is allowed to access to. When granting access to a subresource, access to other resources is limited. Currently it just supports resources of Kind=pod and the format is the following "\<kube_namespace\>/\<kube_pod\>".|string|
|name|The name of the specific resource.|string|
|kind|The resource kind.|string|
|cluster|The name of the cluster the resource is in.|string|

## Threshold Index Set

Encodes a list of threshold indexes. One of the listed thresholds must pass for the set to be considered to have passed (i.e. this is an `or` operator).

```yaml
i:

  - 1
  - 1
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|i|The indexes of thresholds which relate to the role.|[]number|

## Threshold Index Sets

A list of threshold index sets.  Each of the individual sets must pass (i.e. this is an `and` operator).

```yaml
s: 
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
  - # [...]
```

|Field Name|Description|Type|
|---|---|---|
|s|The sets that make up this group.|[][Threshold Index Set](#threshold-index-set)|

## Traits

A wrapper around map with string slices as values
