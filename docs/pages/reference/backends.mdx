description: How to configure Teleport deployment for high-availability using storage backends
---

A Teleport cluster stores different types of data in different locations. By
default everything is stored in a local directory at the Auth server.
Integration with other storage types is implemented based on the nature of the
stored data (size, read/write ratio, mutability, etc.).

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

Teleport Cloud manages Auth Service and Proxy Service data for you, so there is
no need to configure a backend.
</ScopedBlock>

| Data type | Description | Supported storage backends |
| - | - | - |
| core cluster state | Cluster configuration (e.g. users, roles, auth connectors) and identity (e.g. certificate authorities, registered nodes, trusted clusters). | Local directory (SQLite), etcd, AWS DynamoDB, GCP Firestore |
| audit events | JSON-encoded events from the audit log (e.g. user logins, RBAC changes) | Local directory, AWS DynamoDB, GCP Firestore |
| session recordings | Raw terminal recordings of interactive user sessions | Local directory, AWS S3 (and any S3-compatible product), GCP Cloud Storage |
| teleport instance state | ID and credentials of a non-auth teleport instance (e.g. node, proxy) | Local directory |

There are two ways to achieve High Availability. You can "outsource"
this function to the infrastructure. For example, using a highly available
network-based disk volumes (similar to AWS EBS) and by migrating a failed VM to
a new host. In this scenario, there's nothing Teleport-specific to be done.

If High Availability cannot be provided by the infrastructure (perhaps you're
running Teleport on a bare metal cluster), you can still configure Teleport to
run in a highly available fashion.

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Auth Server State

To run multiple instances of Teleport Auth Server, you must switch to a High Availability secrets back-end first.

To do this, use a load balancer to create a single auth API access point (AP) and specify this AP in the `auth_server` field of the Teleport configuration file for all Nodes in a cluster. This load balancer should do TCP-level forwarding.

**IMPORTANT:** with multiple instances of the auth servers running, special
attention needs to be paid to keeping their configuration identical. Settings
like `cluster_name` , `tokens` , `storage` , etc must be the same.

## Proxy State

The Teleport Proxy is stateless which makes running multiple instances trivial.
If using the [default configuration](./networking.mdx), configure your load balancer to
forward ports `3023` and `3080` to the servers that run the Teleport proxy. If
you have configured your proxy to use non-default ports, you will need to
configure your load balancer to forward the ports you specified for
`listen_addr` and `web_listen_addr` in `teleport.yaml`. The load balancer for
`web_listen_addr` can terminate TLS with your own certificate that is valid for
your users, while the remaining ports should do TCP level forwarding, since
Teleport will handle its own SSL on top of that with its own certificates.

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="NOTE"
>
  If you terminate TLS with your own certificate at a load
  balancer you'll need to run Teleport with `--insecure-no-tls`
</Admonition>

If your load balancer supports HTTP health checks, configure it to hit the
`/readyz` [diagnostics endpoint](../management/diagnostics/monitoring.mdx) on machines running Teleport. This endpoint
must be enabled by using the `--diag-addr` flag to teleport start: `teleport start --diag-addr=127.0.0.1:3000`
The [http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz](http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz) endpoint will reply `{"status":"ok"}` if the Teleport service
is running without problems.

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="NOTE"
>
  As the new auth servers get added to the cluster and the old
  servers get decommissioned, nodes and proxies will refresh the list of
  available auth servers and store it in their local cache
  `/var/lib/teleport/authservers.json` - the values from the cache file will take
  precedence over the configuration file.
</Admonition>

We'll cover how to use `etcd`, DynamoDB, and Firestore storage back-ends to make Teleport
highly available below.

## Etcd

Teleport can use [etcd](https://etcd.io/) as a storage backend to
achieve highly available deployments. You must take steps to protect access to
`etcd` in this configuration because that is where Teleport secrets like keys
and user records will be stored.

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="IMPORTANT"
>
  `etcd` can only currently be used to store Teleport's internal database in a
  highly-available way. This will allow you to have multiple auth servers in your
  cluster for an High Availability deployment, but it will not also store Teleport audit events
  for you in the same way that [DynamoDB](#dynamodb) or
  [Firestore](#firestore) will. `etcd` is not designed to handle large volumes of time series data like audit events.
</Admonition>

To configure Teleport for using etcd as a storage backend:

- Make sure you are using **etcd versions 3.3** or newer.
- Follow [etcd's cluster hardware recommendations](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/hardware/). In particular, leverage
  SSD or high-performance virtualized block device storage for best performance.
- Install etcd and configure peer and client TLS authentication using the [etcd
  security guide](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/security/).
  - You can use [this script provided by
    etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/hack/tls-setup) if you
    don't already have a TLS setup.
- Configure all Teleport Auth servers to use etcd in the "storage" section of the config file as shown below.
- Deploy several auth servers connected to etcd backend.
- Deploy several Proxy Service instances that have `auth_server` pointed to the auth server to connect to.

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
     type: etcd

     # List of etcd peers to connect to:
     peers: ["https://172.17.0.1:4001", "https://172.17.0.2:4001"]

     # Required path to TLS client certificate and key files to connect to etcd.
     #
     # To create these, follow
     # https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/generate-self-signed-certificates.html
     # or use the etcd-provided script
     # https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/master/hack/tls-setup.
     tls_cert_file: /var/lib/teleport/etcd-cert.pem
     tls_key_file: /var/lib/teleport/etcd-key.pem

     # Optional file with trusted CA authority
     # file to authenticate etcd nodes
     #
     # If you used the script above to generate the client TLS certificate,
     # this CA certificate should be one of the other generated files
     tls_ca_file: /var/lib/teleport/etcd-ca.pem

     # Alternative password-based authentication, if not using TLS client
     # certificate.
     #
     # See https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/op-guide/authentication/ for setting
     # up a new user.
     username: username
     password_file: /mnt/secrets/etcd-pass

     # etcd key (location) where teleport will be storing its state under.
     # make sure it ends with a '/'!
     prefix: /teleport/

     # NOT RECOMMENDED: enables insecure etcd mode in which self-signed
     # certificate will be accepted
     insecure: false

     # Optionally sets the limit on the client message size.
     # This is usually used to increase the default which is 2MiB
     # (1.5MiB server's default + gRPC overhead bytes).
     # Make sure this does not exceed the value for the etcd
     # server specified with `--max-request-bytes` (1.5MiB by default).
     # Keep the two values in sync.
     #
     # See https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4.0/dev-guide/limit/ for details
     #
     # This bumps the size to 15MiB as an example:
     etcd_max_client_msg_size_bytes: 15728640
```

## S3

  The configuration examples below contain AWS
  access keys and secret keys. They are optional, they exist for your convenience but we DO NOT RECOMMEND using them in production. If Teleport is running on an AWS instance it will automatically use the instance IAM role.
  Teleport also will pick up AWS credentials from the `~/.aws` folder, just like the AWS CLI tool.
</Admonition>

S3 buckets can only be used as storage for the recorded sessions. S3 cannot
store the audit log or the cluster state.

S3 buckets must have versioning enabled, which ensures that a session log cannot
be permanently altered or deleted. Teleport will always look at the oldest
version of a recording.

Below is an example of how to configure the Teleport Auth Service to store the
recorded sessions in an S3 bucket.

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
      # The region setting sets the default AWS region for all AWS services
      # Teleport may consume (DynamoDB, S3)
      region: us-east-1

      # Path to S3 bucket to store the recorded sessions in.
      audit_sessions_uri: "s3://Example_TELEPORT_S3_BUCKET/records"

      # Teleport assumes credentials. Using provider chains, assuming IAM role or
      # standard .aws/credentials in the home folder.
```

The AWS authentication settings above can be omitted if the machine itself is
running on an EC2 instance with an IAM role.

You can add optional query parameters to the S3 URL. The Teleport Auth
Service reads these parameters to configure its interactions with S3:

`s3://bucket/path?region=us-east-1&endpoint=mys3.example.com&insecure=false&disablesse=false&acl=private&use_fips_endpoint=true`

- `region=us-east-1` - set the Amazon region to use.

- `endpoint=mys3.example.com` - connect to a custom S3 endpoint. Optional.

- `insecure=true` - set to `true` or `false`. If `true`, TLS will be disabled.
  Default value is `false`.

- `disablesse=true` - set to `true` or `false`. The Auth Service checks this
  value before uploading an object to an S3 bucket. 

  If this is `false`, the Auth Service will set the server-side encryption
  configuration of the upload to use AWS Key Management Service and, if
  `sse_kms_key` is set, configure the upload to use this key.

  If this value is `true`, the Auth Service will not set an explicit server-side
  encryption configuration for the object upload, meaning that the upload will
  use the bucket-level server-side encryption configuration.

- `sse_kms_key=kms_key_id` - If set to a valid AWS KMS CMK key ID, all objects
  uploaded to S3 will be encrypted with this key (as long as `disablesse` is
  `false`). Details can be found below.

- `acl=private` - set the [canned
  ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl)
  to use. Must be one of the predefined ACL values.

- `use_fips_endpoint=true` -  [Configure S3 FIPS
  endpoints](#configuring-aws-fips-endpoints)

### S3 IAM policy

(!docs/pages/includes/s3-iam-policy.mdx!)

### S3 Server Side Encryption

Teleport supports using a custom AWS KMS Customer Managed Key for encrypting objects uploaded to S3.
This allows you to restrict who can read objects like session recordings separately from those that have read
access to a bucket by restricting key access.

The `sse_kms_key` parameter above can be set to any valid KMS CMK ID corresponding to a symmetric standard spec KMS key.
Example template KMS key policies are provided below for common usage cases. IAM users do not have access to any
key by default. Permissions have to be explicitly granted in the policy.

#### Encryption/Decryption

This policy allows an IAM user to encrypt and decrypt objects.
This allows a cluster auth to write and play back session recordings.

Replace `[iam-key-admin-arn]` with the IAM ARN of the user(s) that should have
administrative key access and `[auth-node-iam-arn]` with the IAM ARN
of the user the Teleport auth nodes are using.

```json
{
  "Id": "Teleport Encryption and Decryption",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Teleport CMK Admin",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "[iam-key-admin-arn]"
      },
      "Action": "kms:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Teleport CMK Auth",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "[auth-node-iam-arn]"
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Encryption/Decryption with separate clusters

This policy allows specifying separate IAM users for encryption and decryption.
This can be used to set up a multi cluster configuration where the main cluster
cannot play back session recordings but only write them.
A separate cluster authenticating as a different IAM user with decryption access
can be used for playing back the session recordings.

Replace `[iam-key-admin-arn]` with the IAM ARN of the user(s) that should have
administrative key access, `[iam-node-write-arn]` with the IAM ARN of the user the
main write-only cluster auth nodes are using and `[iam-node-read-arn]` with the
IAM ARN of the user used by the read-only cluster.

For this to work the second cluster has to be connected to the same audit log as the main cluster.
This is needed to detect session recordings.

```json
{
  "Id": "Teleport Separate Encryption and Decryption",
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Teleport CMK Admin",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "[iam-key-admin-arn]"
      },
      "Action": "kms:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Teleport CMK Auth Encrypt",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "[auth-node-write-arn]"
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:ReEncrypt*",
        "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Teleport CMK Auth Decrypt",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "[auth-node-read-arn]"
      },
      "Action": [
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ACL example: transferring object ownership

If you are uploading from AWS account `A` to a bucket owned by AWS account `B` and want `A` to retain ownership of the objects, you can take one of two approaches.

#### Without ACLs

If ACLs are disabled, object ownership will be set to `Bucket owner enforced` and no action will be needed.

#### With ACLs

- Set object ownership to `Bucket owner preferred` (under Permissions in the management console).
- Add `acl=bucket-owner-full-control` to `audit_sessions_uri`.

To enforce the ownership transfer, set `B`'s bucket's policy to only allow uploads that include the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "[id]",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "[sid]",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "[ARN of account A]"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BucketName/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

## DynamoDB

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"

  Before continuing, please make sure to take a look at the [Cluster State section](../architecture/nodes.mdx#cluster-state)
  in Teleport Architecture documentation.
</Admonition>

If you are running Teleport on AWS, you can use
[DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) as a storage back-end to achieve
High Availability. DynamoDB backend supports two types of Teleport data:

- Cluster state
- Audit log events

Teleport uses DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams endpoints for its storage
back-end management.

DynamoDB cannot store the recorded sessions. You are advised to use AWS S3 for
that as shown above. To configure Teleport to use DynamoDB:

- Make sure you have AWS access key and a secret key that give you access to
  DynamoDB account. If you're using (as recommended) an IAM role for this, the policy with the necessary permissions is listed below.
- Configure all Teleport Auth servers to use DynamoDB back-end in the "storage"
  section of `teleport.yaml` as shown below.
- Auth servers must be able to reach DynamoDB and DynamoDB Streams endpoints.
- Deploy several auth servers connected to DynamoDB storage back-end.
- Deploy several proxy nodes.
- Make sure that all Teleport resource services have the `auth_servers` configuration setting
  populated with the addresses of your cluster's Auth Service instances.

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
    type: dynamodb
    # Region location of dynamodb instance, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_pv/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ddb_region
    region: us-east-1

    # Name of the DynamoDB table. If it does not exist, Teleport will create it.
    table_name: Example_TELEPORT_DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME

    # This setting configures Teleport to send the audit events to three places:
    # To keep a copy in DynamoDB, a copy on a local filesystem, and also output the events to stdout.
    # NOTE: The DynamoDB events table has a different schema to the regular Teleport
    # database table, so attempting to use the same table for both will result in errors.
    # When using highly available storage like DynamoDB, you should make sure that the list always specifies
    # the High Availability storage method first, as this is what the Teleport web UI uses as its source of events to display.
    audit_events_uri:  ['dynamodb://events_table_name', 'file:///var/lib/teleport/audit/events', 'stdout://']

    # This setting configures Teleport to save the recorded sessions in an S3 bucket:
    audit_sessions_uri: s3://Example_TELEPORT_S3_BUCKET/records

    # By default, Teleport stores audit events with an AWS TTL of 1 year.
    # This value can be configured as shown below. If set to 0 seconds, TTL is disabled.
    audit_retention_period: 365d
```

- Replace `us-east-1` and `Example_TELEPORT_DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME`
  with your own settings.  Teleport will create the table automatically.
- `Example_TELEPORT_DYNAMO_TABLE_NAME` and `events_table_name` **must** be different
  DynamoDB tables. The schema is different for each. Using the same table name for both will result in errors.
- The AWS authentication setting above can be omitted if the machine itself is running on an EC2 instance with an IAM role.
- Audit log settings above are optional. If specified, Teleport will store the
  audit log in DynamoDB and the session recordings **must** be stored in an S3
  bucket, i.e. both `audit_xxx` settings must be present. If they are not set,
  Teleport will default to a local file system for the audit log, i.e.
  `/var/lib/teleport/log` on an auth server.

The optional `GET` parameters shown below control how Teleport interacts with a DynamoDB endpoint.

`dynamodb://events_table_name?region=us-east-1&endpoint=dynamo.example.com&use_fips_endpoint=true`

- `region=us-east-1` - set the Amazon region to use.
- `endpoint=dynamo.example.com` - connect to a custom S3 endpoint.
- `use_fips_endpoint=true` -  [Configure DynamoDB FIPS endpoints](#configuring-aws-fips-endpoints).

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Access to DynamoDB"

  Make sure that the IAM role assigned to
  Teleport is configured with sufficient access to DynamoDB. Below is the
  example of the IAM policy you can use:
</Admonition>

```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
            "Sid": "AllAPIActionsOnTeleportAuth",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "dynamodb:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:eu-west-1:123456789012:table/prod.teleport.auth"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllAPIActionsOnTeleportStreams",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "dynamodb:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:eu-west-1:123456789012:table/prod.teleport.auth/stream/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### DynamoDB autoscaling

When setting up DynamoDB it's important to set up backups. Autoscaling is
optional with Teleport, and it is advised to collect some production usage data
before enabling autoscaling.

Autoscaling and backup can be configured on DynamoDB directly. We also make
setup simpler by allowing AWS DynamoDB settings to be set automatically during
Teleport startup. The configuration is described below.

**DynamoDB Continuous Backups**

- [AWS Blog Post - Amazon DynamoDB Continuous Backup](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-dynamodb-continuous-backups-and-point-in-time-recovery-pitr/)

**DynamoDB Autoscaling Options**

- [AWS Docs - Managing Throughput Capacity Automatically with DynamoDB Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/AutoScaling.html)

<Notice type="danger">

AWS can throttle DynamoDB if more than two processes are reading from the same
stream's shard simultaneously, so you must not deploy more than two Auth Service
instances that read from a DynamoDB backend. For details on DynamoDB Streams,
read the [AWS
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html).

</Notice>

```yaml
# ...
teleport:
  storage:
    type: "dynamodb"
    [...]

    # continuous_backups is used to optionally enable continuous backups.
    # default: false
    continuous_backups: [true|false]

    # auto_scaling is used to optionally enable (and define settings for) auto scaling.
    # default: false
    auto_scaling:  [true|false]
    # Minimum/maximum read capacity in units
    read_min_capacity: int
    read_max_capacity: int
    read_target_value: float
    # Minimum/maximum write capacity in units
    write_min_capacity: int
    write_max_capacity: int
    write_target_value: float
```

To enable these options you will need to update the IAM Policy for Teleport.

```json
{
    "Action": [
        "application-autoscaling:PutScalingPolicy",
        "application-autoscaling:RegisterScalableTarget"
    ],
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "*"
},
{
    "Action": [
        "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
    ],
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
            "iam:AWSServiceName": [
                "dynamodb.application-autoscaling.amazonaws.com"
            ]
        }
    },
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

### Configuring AWS FIPS endpoints

This config option applies to [AWS S3](#s3) and [AWS DynamoDB](#dynamodb).

Set `use_fips_endpoint` to `true` or `false`. If `true`, [FIPS](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/) Dynamo endpoints will be used.
If `false`, normal Dynamo endpoints will be used. If unset, the AWS Environment Variable `AWS_USE_FIPS_ENDPOINT` will determine which endpoint is used.
FIPS endpoints will also be used if Teleport is run with the `--fips` flag.

Config option priority is applied in the following order:

- Setting the `use_fips_endpoint` query parameter as shown above
- Using the `--fips` flag when running Teleport
- Using the AWS environment variable

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="A warning about AWS_USE_FIPS_ENDPOINT"
>
  Setting this environment variable to true will enable FIPS endpoints for all AWS resource types. Some FIPS endpoints
  are not supported in certain regions or environments or are only supported in GovCloud.
</Admonition>

## GCS

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  Before continuing, please make sure to take a look at the [Cluster State section](../architecture/nodes.mdx#cluster-state)
  in Teleport Architecture documentation.
</Admonition>

Google Cloud Storage (GCS) can be used as storage for recorded
sessions. GCS cannot store the audit log or the cluster state. Below is an
example of how to configure a Teleport auth server to store the recorded
sessions in a GCS bucket.

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
      # Path to GCS to store the recorded sessions in.
      audit_sessions_uri: 'gs://$BUCKET_NAME/records?projectID=$PROJECT_ID&credentialsPath=$CREDENTIALS_PATH'
```

We recommend creating a bucket in `Dual-Region` mode with the `Standard` storage class to ensure cluster performance and high availability.
Replace the following variables in the above example with your own values:
- `$BUCKET_NAME` with the name of the desired GCS bucket. If the bucket does not exist it will be created.
  Please ensure the following permissions are granted for the given bucket:
  - `storage.buckets.get`
  - `storage.objects.create`
  - `storage.objects.get`
  - `storage.objects.list`
  - `storage.objects.update`
  - `storage.objects.delete`

  `storage.objects.delete` is required in order to clean up multipart files
  after they have been assembled into the final blob.

  If the bucket does not exist, please also ensure that the `storage.buckets.create` permission is granted.

- `$PROJECT_ID` with a GCS-enabled GCP project.

- `$CREDENTIALS_PATH` with the path to a JSON-formatted GCP credentials file configured for a service account applicable to the project.

## Firestore

</Admonition>

If you are running Teleport on GCP, you can use
[Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/) as a storage back-end to achieve
high availability. Firestore backend supports two types of Teleport data:

- Cluster state
- Audit log events

Firestore cannot store the recorded sessions. You are advised to use Google
Cloud Storage (GCS) for that as shown above. To configure Teleport to use
Firestore:

- Configure all Teleport Auth servers to use Firestore back-end in the "storage"
  section of `teleport.yaml` as shown below.
- Deploy several auth servers connected to Firestore storage back-end.
- Deploy several proxy nodes.
- Make sure that all Teleport resource services have the `auth_servers`
  configuration setting populated with the addresses of your cluster's Auth
  Service instances or use a load balancer for Auth Service instances in high
  availability mode.

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
    type: firestore
    # Project ID https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113?hl=en
    project_id: Example_GCP_Project_Name

    # Name of the Firestore table.
    collection_name: Example_TELEPORT_FIRESTORE_TABLE_NAME

    credentials_path: /var/lib/teleport/gcs_creds

    # This setting configures Teleport to send the audit events to three places:
    # To keep a copy in Firestore, a copy on a local filesystem, and also write the events to stdout.
    # NOTE: The Firestore events table has a different schema to the regular Teleport
    # database table, so attempting to use the same table for both will result in errors.
    # When using highly available storage like Firestore, you should make sure that the list always specifies
    # the High Availability storage method first, as this is what the Teleport web UI uses as its source of events to display.
    audit_events_uri:  ['firestore://Example_TELEPORT_FIRESTORE_EVENTS_TABLE_NAME', 'file:///var/lib/teleport/audit/events', 'stdout://']

    # This setting configures Teleport to save the recorded sessions in GCP storage:
    audit_sessions_uri: gs://Example_TELEPORT_GCS_BUCKET/records
```

- Replace `Example_GCP_Project_Name` and `Example_TELEPORT_FIRESTORE_TABLE_NAME`
  with your own settings. Teleport will create the table automatically.
- `Example_TELEPORT_FIRESTORE_TABLE_NAME` and `Example_TELEPORT_FIRESTORE_EVENTS_TABLE_NAME`
  **must** be different Firestore tables. The schema is different for each.
  Using the same table name for both will result in errors.
- The GCP authentication setting above can be omitted if the machine itself is
  running on a GCE instance with a Service Account that has access to the
  Firestore table.
- Audit log settings above are optional. If specified, Teleport will store the audit log in Firestore
  and the session recordings **must** be stored in a GCS bucket, i.e. both `audit_xxx` settings must
  be present. If they are not set, Teleport will default to a local filesystem for the audit log, i.e.
  `/var/lib/teleport/log` on an auth server.

## SQLite

The Auth Service uses the SQLite backend when no `type` is specified in the
storage section in the Teleport configuration file, or when `type` is set to
`sqlite` or `dir`. The SQLite backend is not designed for high throughput and
it's not capable of serving the needs of Teleport's High Availability configurations.

If you are planning to use SQLite as your backend, scale your cluster slowly and
monitor the number of warning messages in the Auth Service's logs that say
`SLOW TRANSACTION`, as that's a sign that the cluster has outgrown the capabilities
of the SQLite backend.

As a stopgap measure until it's possible to migrate the cluster to use a
HA-capable backend, you can configure the SQLite backend to reduce the amount of
disk synchronization, in exchange for less resilience against system crashes or
power loss. For an explanation on what the options mean, see [the official
SQLite docs](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous). No matter
the configuration, we recommend you take regular backups of your cluster state.

To reduce disk synchronization:
```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
    type: sqlite
    sync: NORMAL
```

To disable disk synchronization altogether:
```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
    type: sqlite
    sync: "OFF"
```

When running on a filesystem that supports file locks (i.e. a local filesystem,
not a networked one) it's possible to also configure the SQLite database to use
Write-Ahead Logging (see [the official docs on WAL
mode](https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html)) for significantly improved performance
without sacrificing reliability:

```yaml
teleport:
  storage:
    type: sqlite
    sync: NORMAL
    journal: WAL
```
