The `fdpass-teleport` binary is used to integrate Machine ID with OpenSSH to
enable higher performance and reduced resource consumption when establishing SSH
connections.

You should not need to manually invoke `fdpass-teleport` and it will
automatically be included in OpenSSH configurations generated by the Machine ID
SSH multiplexer service. For further information, see the
[Machine ID reference](../machine-id/configuration.mdx).

## Usage

```code
fdpass-teleport <path to mux socket> <connection target>
```

- `<path to mux socket>`: path to the Unix domain socket created by the Machine
  ID SSH multiplexer service.
- `<connection target>`: the target address to connect to. This is passed to the
  SSH multiplexer service when establishing the connection.
