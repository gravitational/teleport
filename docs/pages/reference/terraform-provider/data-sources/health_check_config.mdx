- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the health check config specification. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-spec))
- `version` (String) Version is the health check config version.

### Optional

- `labels` (Map of String) labels is a set of labels.


### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `match` (Attributes) Match is used to select resources that these settings apply to. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specmatch))

Optional:

- `healthy_threshold` (Number) HealthyThreshold is the number of consecutive passing health checks after which a target's health status becomes "healthy".
- `interval` (String) Interval is the time between each health check.

- `db_labels_expression` (String) DBLabelsExpression is a label predicate expression to match databases. An empty value is ignored. The match result is logically ANDed with DBLabels, if both are non-empty.
