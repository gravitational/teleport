- `rotate_after` (String) RotateAfter is an optional timestamp that forces clients to perform a keypair rotation on the next join or recovery attempt after the given date. If `LastRotatedAt` is unset or before this timestamp, a rotation will be requested. It is recommended to set this value to the current timestamp if a rotation should be triggered on the next join attempt.

### Nested Schema for `spec.bound_keypair.onboarding`

Optional:

- `initial_public_key` (String) InitialPublicKey is used to preregister a public key generated by `tbot keypair create`. When set, no initial join secret is generated or made available for use, and clients must have the associated private key available to join. If set, `initial_join_secret` and `must_register_before` are ignored. This value is written in SSH authorized_keys format.
- `must_register_before` (String) MustRegisterBefore is an optional time before which registeration via initial join secret must be performed. Attempts to register using an initial join secret after this timestamp will not be allowed. This may be modified after creation if necessary to allow the initial registration to take place. This value is ignored if `initial_public_key` is set.
- `registration_secret` (String) RegistrationSecret is a secret joining clients may use to register their public key on first join, which may be used instead of preregistering a public key with `initial_public_key`. If `initial_public_key` is set, this value is ignored. Otherwise, if set, this value will be used to populate `.status.bound_keypair.intitial_join_secret`. If unset and no `initial_public_key` is provided, a random secure value will be generated server-side to populate the status field.


### Nested Schema for `spec.bound_keypair.recovery`

Optional:

- `limit` (Number) Limit is the maximum number of allowed recovery attempts. This value may be raised or lowered after creation to allow additional recovery attempts should the initial limit be exhausted. If `mode` is set to `standard`, recovery attempts will only be allowed if `.status.bound_keypair.recovery_count` is less than this limit. This limit is not enforced if `mode` is set to `relaxed` or `insecure`. This value must be at least 1 to allow for the initial join during onboarding, which counts as a recovery.
- `mode` (String) Mode sets the recovery rule enforcement mode. It may be one of these values: - standard (or unset): all configured rules enforced. The recovery limit and client join state are required and verified. This is the most secure recovery mode. - relaxed: recovery limit is not enforced, but client join state is still required. This effectively allows unlimited recovery attempts, but client join state still helps mitigate stolen credentials. - insecure: neither the recovery limit nor client join state are enforced. This allows any client with the private key to join freely. This is less secure, but can be useful in certain situations, like in otherwise unsupported CI/CD providers. This mode should be used with care, and RBAC rules should be configured to heavily restrict which resources this identity can access.



### Nested Schema for `spec.circleci`

Optional:

- `allow` (Attributes List) Allow is a list of TokenRules, nodes using this token must match one allow rule to use this token. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-speccircleciallow))

This value should be the hostname of the GHES instance, and should not include the scheme or a path. The instance must be accessible over HTTPS at this hostname and the certificate must be trusted by the Auth Service.
- `enterprise_slug` (String) EnterpriseSlug allows the slug of a GitHub Enterprise organisation to be included in the expected issuer of the OIDC tokens. This is for compatibility with the `include_enterprise_slug` option in GHE.  This field should be set to the slug of your enterprise if this is enabled.
