### Optional

- `metadata` (Attributes) metadata is the rules's metadata. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-metadata))

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `subjects` (List of String) subjects the rule operates on, can be a resource kind or a particular resource property.

Optional:

- `automatic_review` (Attributes) automatic_review defines automatic review configurations for access requests. Both notification and automatic_review may be set within the same access_monitoring_rule. If both fields are set, the rule will trigger both notifications and automatic reviews for the same set of access events. Separate plugins may be used if both notifications and automatic_reviews is set. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specautomatic_review))
- `condition` (String) condition is a predicate expression that operates on the specified subject resources, and determines whether the subject will be moved into desired state.
- `desired_state` (String) desired_state defines the desired state of the subject. For access request subjects, the desired_state may be set to `reviewed` to indicate that the access request should be automatically reviewed.
- `notification` (Attributes) notification defines the plugin configuration for notifications if rule is triggered. Both notification and automatic_review may be set within the same access_monitoring_rule. If both fields are set, the rule will trigger both notifications and automatic reviews for the same set of access events. Separate plugins may be used if both notifications and automatic_reviews is set. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specnotification))
- `states` (List of String) states are the desired state which the monitoring rule is attempting to bring the subjects matching the condition to.

### Nested Schema for `spec.automatic_review`

Optional:

- `decision` (String) decision specifies the proposed state of the access review. This can be either 'approved' or 'denied'.
- `integration` (String) integration is the name of the integration that is responsible for monitoring the rule. Set this value to `builtin` to monitor the rule with Teleport.


### Nested Schema for `spec.notification`
