- `forward_agent` (Boolean) ForwardAgent is SSH agent forwarding.

- `type` (Number) Type represents the certificate type being extended, only ssh is supported at this time. 0 is "ssh".
- `value` (String) Value specifies the value to be used in the cert extension.


### Nested Schema for `spec.options.idp`
