The Teleport Terraform provider allows Terraform users to configure Teleport
from Terraform.

This section is the Teleport Terraform Provider reference.
It lists all the supported resources and their fields.

<Admonition type="tip">
To get started with the Terraform provider, you must start with [the installation
guide](../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx).
Once you got a working provider, we recommend you to follow the
["Managing users and roles with IaC"](
../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/managing-resources/user-and-role.mdx) guide.
</Admonition>

The provider exposes Teleport resources both as Terraform data-sources and Terraform resources.
Data-sources are used by Terraform to fetch information from Teleport, while resources are used
to create resources in Teleport.

{/* Note: the awkward `resource-index` file names are here because `data-sources`
is reserved by the generator for the catch-all resource template */}

<TabItem label="self-hosted">

```hcl

    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  # Update addr to point to Teleport Auth/Proxy
  # addr              = "auth.example.com:3025"

## Connection methods

This section lists the different ways of passing credentials to the Terraform provider.
You can find which method fits your use case in
the [Teleport Terraform provider setup
page](../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx)

### With an identity file

With this connection method, you must provide an identity file.This file allows Terraform to connect both via the Proxy
Service (ports 443 or 3080) and via the Auth Service (port 3025). This is the recommended way of passing credentials to
the Terraform provider.

The identity file can be obtained via several ways:

### Obtaining an identity file locally with `tctl`

Since 16.2, you can use `tctl` and your local credentials to create a temporary bot and load its identity
in your shell's environment variables:

```code
$ eval "$(tctl terraform env)"
🔑 Detecting if MFA is required
This is an admin-level action and requires MFA to complete
Tap any security key
Detected security key tap
⚙️ Creating temporary bot "tctl-terraform-env-82ab1a2e" and its token
🤖 Using the temporary bot to obtain certificates
🚀 Certificates obtained, you can now use Terraform in this terminal for 1h0m0s
```

You can find more information in
the ["Run the Terraform provider locally" guide](../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/local.mdx)

#### Obtaining an identity file via `tbot`

`tbot` relies on [Machine ID](../../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/introduction.mdx) to obtain and automatically renew
short-lived credentials. Such credentials are harder to exfiltrate, and you can control more precisely who has access to
which roles (e.g. you can allow only GitHub Actions pipelines targeting the `prod` environment to get certificates).

You can follow [the Terraform Provider
guide](../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx) to setup `tbot`
and have Terraform use its identity.

#### Obtaining an identity file via `tctl auth sign`

You can obtain an identity file with the command

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user terraform --format file -o identity.pem
```

This auth method has the following limitations:
- Such credentials are high-privileged and long-lived. They must be protected and rotated.
- This auth method does not work against Teleport clusters with MFA set to `webauthn`.
  On such clusters, Teleport will reject any long-lived certificate and require
  [an additional MFA challenge for administrative actions](../../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/mfa-for-admin-actions.mdx).

### With a token (native MachineID)

Starting with 16.2, the Teleport Terraform provider can natively use MachineID (without `tbot`) to join a Teleport
cluster. The Terraform Provider will rely on its runtime (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, CI/CD system) to prove its identity to
Teleport.

You can use any [delegated join method](../join-methods.mdx#delegated-join-methods) by setting
both `join_method` and `join_token` in the provider configuration.

This setup is described in more details in
the ["Run the Teleport Terraform provider in CI or Cloud" guide](../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/ci-or-cloud.mdx).

### With key, certificate, and CA certificate

With this connection method, you must provide a TLS key, a TLS certificate, and the Teleport Auth Service TLS CA certificates.
Those can be obtained with the command:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user terraform --format=tls -o terraform.pem
```

This auth method has the following limitations:
- The provider can only connect to the Auth directly (port 3025). On most clusters, only the proxy is publicly exposed.
- Such credentials are high-privileged and long-lived. They must be protected and rotated.
- This auth method does not work against Teleport clusters with MFA set to `webauthn`.
  On such clusters, Teleport will reject any long-lived certificate and require
  [an additional MFA challenge for administrative actions](../../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/mfa-for-admin-actions.mdx).
