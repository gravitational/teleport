title: Configure Access Requests
description: Describes the options available for configuring just-in-time access to roles and resources in your Teleport cluster.
tocDepth: 3
---

This guide explains the considerations you should make when configuring Teleport
Access Requests, which enable a Teleport user to obtain elevated permissions by
getting approval from one or more users in the same Teleport cluster.

Access Requests are configurable on a role-by-role basis. When a user
authenticates to Teleport, including through a single sign-on provider, the
Teleport Auth Service reconciles all of a user's roles to determine the Access
Request configuration for that user. Teleport then applies this configuration to
any Access Requests the user creates.

For examples of the full Access Request lifecycle, follow one of the how-to
guides:

- [Role requests in commercial Teleport editions](role-requests.mdx)
- [Resource requests in commercial Teleport editions](resource-requests.mdx)
- [Role requests in Teleport Community Edition](oss-role-requests.mdx)

## The access a user can request

By default, a Teleport user cannot request elevated permissions. To configure
the elevated access that a user can request, you can define a Teleport role
that:

- Names other Teleport roles the user can request.
- Names other Teleport roles that the user can use to search for resources to
  request, such as databases or Kubernetes clusters.

You can also configure a Teleport role to prevent the user from requesting
access to these roles.

### Restrict role requests

When a user submits an Access Request, they can specify the roles they would
like to request access to.

You can allow a user to request access to certain roles—and deny access to other
roles—by using the following configuration options:

- `allow.request.roles`
- `allow.request.claims_to_roles`
- `deny.request.roles`
- `deny.request.claims_to_roles`

Here is an example, which allows the `employee` user to request the `dev` and
`dba` role, and specifies some more complex restrictions that we will explain
below:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: employee
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles:
        - 'dev'
        - 'dba'
      claims_to_roles:
        - claim: groups
          value: admins
          roles: ['*']
  deny:
    request:
      claims_to_roles:
        - claim: groups
          value: contractors
          roles: ['*']
```

The Teleport Auth Service combines the values of these fields for all of a
user's roles into two lists of role matchers:

- **Deny:** If the requested role matches any of these, Teleport denies the
  request.
- **Allow:** If the requested role matches any of these, and no deny matcher
  also matches the role, Teleport allows the request.

A role matcher can include the following values:

- The literal name of a role (such as `admin`).
- A wildcard character, which matches one or more characters in a role name. For
  example, `db-*` matches `db-reader` and `db-writer`.
- A [Go regular expression](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax) inside a string
  that begins with `^` and ends with `$`. For example, if you define roles by
  AWS region, a role matcher could use the regular expression
  `^db-writer-us-(east|west)-[0-9]+` to match the `db-writer-us-east-1` and
  `db-writer-us-west-2` roles.

To add the values of `claims_to_roles` to the lists of role matchers, the Auth
Service evaluates template expressions with the user's traits. See the [Role
Templates](../guides/role-templates.mdx#templating-in-access-requests) for more
information on how Teleport executes template expressions with user traits in
the `claims_to_roles` field.

In the `employee` role above, if the user is in the `admins` group (as declared
by their single sign-on provider), this role allows them to request access to
all roles.  If they are in the `contractors` group, this role denies them access
to request any roles.

### Restrict resource requests

Users can also submit Access Requests for a specific Teleport resource.

The following fields in a Teleport role indicate which roles a user assumes when
they search for a Teleport resource:

- `allow.request.search_as_roles`
- `deny.request.search_as_roles`

For example, the following role enables a user to search for resources by
assuming all roles *except* for the `k8s-viewer` role:

```yaml
# requester.yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: k8s-denier
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - '*'
 deny:
   request:
      search_as_roles:
        - k8s-viewer
```

As with [configuring role requests](#restrict-role-requests), the
`request.search_as_roles` field is a list of role matchers that can include
literal role names, wildcards, and regular expressions.

The Teleport Auth Service combines the values of these fields for all of a
user's Teleport roles in order to validate the user's Access Requests.

When a user attempts to list Teleport resources (such as servers and databases)
or Kubernetes resources (such as pods and deployments), the Auth Service checks
the roles that the user is allowed to search as. If a user's Teleport roles *or*
a role specified in `search_as_roles` allow the user to search for a resource,
the Teleport Auth Service will return information about the resource.

When a user requests access to a resource ID, the Teleport Auth Service does the
following:

1. Collects all the roles named in `allow.request.search_as_roles`, filtering
   these to exclude roles specified in `deny.request.search_as_roles` or
   `deny.request.roles`.
1. Determines which of the remaining roles can access the requested resource.
   For a Resource Access Request to be valid, one of the role matchers listed in
   a user's `search_as_roles` configuration must match a role that permits
   access to the requested resources.

## How long access lasts

You can configure the length of time that Teleport will grant a user elevated
privileges for an approved Access Request.

### Calculating the duration of elevated privileges

Teleport uses the following logic to calculate how long a user has elevated
privileges:

1. Calculate the maximum duration of elevated privileges if the Access Request
   were granted. This is the lowest value of:
   - The `--max-duration` flag of the [`tsh request
     create`](../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-request-create) command (if the
     user creating the request provides this flag).
   - The lowest value of the `request.max_duration` field included in one of
     the user's requested roles.
1. Calculate the session TTL of the certificate the user would receive if
   Teleport were to grant the Access Request. This calculation chooses the
   lowest value of:
   - The requested session expiration time, which is the value of the
     `--session-ttl` flag of [`tsh request
     create`](../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-request-create).
   - The remaining time in the user's current Teleport session.
   - The lowest value of the `options.max_session_ttl` field in the user's
     requested roles.
1. If the maximum duration is greater than zero, set the duration of elevated
   privileges to either the maximum duration or the session TTL calculated
   earlier, whichever is shorter. Otherwise, set the duration of elevated
   privileges to the session TTL.

### Setting when users can assume elevated privileges

When creating or reviewing Access Requests, you can specify the earliest time
that a user can assume elevated privileges by using the `--assume-start-time`
flag. This flag is available for the
[`tsh request create`](../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-request-create) and [`tsh request
review`](../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-request-review) commands. The format accepted
is defined in [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339), e.g, `2023-12-12T23:20:50.52Z`.
The time specified must be in the future.

Reviewers can override this time when approving an Access Request.
If multiple reviewers override the start time, the most recent
override will be chosen.

### The `request.max_duration` field

The `max_duration` option indicates the maximum length of time that a user is
allowed to have elevated privileges for particular roles. After a user makes a
successful Access Request, the user can authenticate to Teleport with the
elevated access until the maximum duration has elapsed.

Each time the user authenticates to Teleport, Teleport calculates the TTL of the
user's Teleport session using a formula that we describe in the [previous
section](#calculating-the-duration-of-elevated-privileges). The user can have
multiple sessions with elevated privileges before the maximum duration elapses.

You can specify the `max_duration` option with a role like the following:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: temp-dba
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      # Allow access to role `dba` for up to 4 days.
      roles: ['dba']
      max_duration: 4d
```

The value of `max_duration` can never exceed fourteen days.

### How long Access Requests are valid

Teleport uses the following logic to determine how long an Access Request is
valid while it awaits approval:

1. Begin with with the base expiration of the Access Request, which a user can
   set with the `--request-ttl` flag of the [`tsh request
   create`](../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-request-create) command. If this is
   unset, the request TTL is one hour.
1. If the user's Teleport session is due to expire before the base expiration
   time, Teleport sets the Access Request expiration to the end of the Teleport
   session.
1. If any of the Teleport roles requested by the Access Request has an
   `options.max_session_ttl` that expires before the expiration time, Teleport
   sets the expiration of the Access Request to that time.
1. Return an error if the value of `--request-ttl` is greater than the request
   TTL calculated in the previous step.

## How clients request access

A user's Teleport roles determine how they submit Access Requests, whether
Access Requests are optional or mandatory, and whether a user must provide a
reason when making a request.

A role's `options.request_access` setting specifies a strategy for producing
Access Requests. It can include one of the following values:

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`optional`|The default. The user does not need to specify a reason when making a request. The user must initiate a request manually when they log in to Teleport.|
|`always`| When a user signs in to Teleport, their client automatically generates an Access Request for all roles available to the user, without providing a reason.|
|`reason`| When a user signs in to Teleport, their client automatically generates an Access Request for all roles available to the user. The user must provide a reason when authenticating.|

If a role includes the `reason` strategy, you can specify a prompt to remind the
user to provide a reason if the user attempts to create an Access Request
without one. To do so, set the `options.request_prompt` option in a role.

For example, the following role prompts the user with the text, "Please provide
your ticket ID":


```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: employee
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles:
        - 'dba'
  options:
    request_access: reason
    request_prompt: Please provide your ticket ID
```

The Teleport Auth Service uses the following logic to combine strategies
specified in the `request_access` fields of different roles that belong to a
user:

1. If one of the user's roles includes either the `reason` or the `always`
   strategy, Teleport will automatically request all available roles for the
   user when they authenticate.
1. If one of the user's roles includes the `reason` strategy, the user must
   provide a reason when authenticating.

## Review thresholds

You can configure a user's roles to specify the criteria that an Access Request
must meet before Teleport approves or denies it. To do so, configure the
`allow.request.thresholds` field.

### The `allow.request.thresholds` field

Here is an example of a role that specifies review thresholds for requestable
roles:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: devops
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles: ['dbadmin']
      thresholds:
        - approve: 3
          deny: 2
          filter: '!contains(reviewer.traits.team, "dev")'
        - approve: 1
          deny: 1
          filter: 'contains(reviewer.roles, "admin")'
```

Note that there is no corresponding `deny.requests.thresholds` field, and
Teleport rejects roles that include one.

Each threshold includes the following fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|`approve`|The number of reviewers that must approve the Access Request for it to be approved. The default is 1.|
|`deny`|The number of reviewers that must deny the Access Request for it to be denied. The default is 1.|
|`filter`|A condition that the Access Request or its review must satisfy before a review is added to a threshold's approval or denial count. Described in more detail in the [next section](#threshold-filters).|

In the `devops` role above, there are two thresholds associated with the
`dbadmin` role. As a result, one of the following conditions must obtain before
the request is approved is denied:

1. Three users must approve the request, and two users must deny it, as long as
   those users do not have a `team` trait with the value `dev`.
1. One user must approve the review, and one user must deny it, as long as the
   user submitting the review has the `admin` role.

### Threshold filters

When Teleport processes an Access Request for a specific role, it checks whether
the request has met the criteria specified in one of the thresholds in
`allow.request.thresholds` associated with that role.

The value of `filter` is an expression that uses the Teleport [predicate
language](../../reference/predicate-language.mdx).

For example, the following configuration includes four thresholds, three of which
have filters:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles: ['dbadmin']
      thresholds:
        - approve: 3
          deny: 1
        - filter: 'contains(reviewer.roles, "super-approver")'
          approve: 2
          deny: 1
        - filter: '!equals(request.reason, "") && contains(reviewer.roles, "super-approver")'
          approve: 1
          deny: 1
        - filter: 'regexp.match(request.reason, "^Ticket [0-9]+.*$") && !equals(review.reason, "")'
          approve: 1
          deny: 1
```

The first threshold requires three users to approve and one user to deny.
However, if each reviewer has the `super-approver` role, the request only needs
two approvals.
If the request has a non-empty reason, it only needs a single approval from a
user with the `super-approver` role.
If the request has a reason matching the regex `^Ticket [0-9]+.*$`, it only
needs a single approval from any reviewer, as long as the reviewer provides a
non-empty reason.

Filter expressions can draw on the following data associated with each Access
Request review: the request, the reviewer, and the review itself:

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`reviewer.roles`|`[]string`|The reviewer's roles.|
|`reviewer.traits`|`map[string][]string`|The reviewer's traits.|
|`review.reason`|`string`|The reason given for the review.|
|`review.annotations`|`map[string][]string`|Annotations added to the review. These are added by programmatic Teleport clients that approve or deny an Access Request.|
|`request.roles`|`[]string`|The roles included in the request.|
|`request.reason`|`string`|The reason provided in the request.|
|`request.system_annotations`|`map[string][]string`|[Request annotations](#request-annotations).|

You can use these fields in expressions that include the following operators and
functions:

|Operator/Function|Description|
|---|---|
|`equals(val1,val2)`|Returns `true` if `val1` is equal to `val2` and `false` otherwise|
|`contains(list, item)`|Returns `true` if `list` contains an exact match for `item`.|
|`regexp.match(list, re)`|Returns `true` if `list` contains a match for `re`.|
|`expr1 && expr2`|Evaluates to `true` if both `expr1` and `expr2` evaluate to `true`.|
|`expr1 \|\| expr2`|Evaluates to `true` if `expr1`, `expr2`, or both evaluate to `true`.|
|`!expr`|Negates `expr`.|

Above, any argument named `list` can accept a list of values (like
`request.roles`) or a single value (like `request.reason`).

The `re` argument to `regexp.match` supports both glob-style wildcards (the `*`
character) and [Go-style regular expressions](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp).
If an expression begins with the `^` character and ends with the `$` character,
Teleport will evaluate it as a regular expression.
Otherwise, it will evaluate it as a wildcard expression.
Wildcards match any sequence of zero or more characters.

## Suggested reviewers

You can configure a Teleport role to suggest reviewers for Access Requests.

Teleport combines all reviewers named in the `allow.request.suggested_reviewers`
fields of a user's roles. If an Access Request has no suggested reviewers,
Teleport adds the user's suggested reviewers to the request.

The following role adds the suggested reviewers `user1` and `user2`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: employee
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles:
        - 'dev'
        - 'dba'
      suggested_reviewers:
       - 'user1'
       - 'user2'
```

Suggested reviewers apply to all of the roles a user can request access to, not
just the roles named in the same `role` resource as the suggested reviewers.

While Teleport will accept a role with a nonempty
`deny.request.suggested_reviewers` field, it only considers the
`allow.request.suggested_reviewers` field when evaluating Access Requests.

## Roles that a reviewer can grant access to

Teleport users must be authorized to review Access Requests for a particular
role. You can configure a user's Teleport roles to allow the user to review Access
Requests for some Teleport roles, and deny the user the ability to review
requests for other roles.

### Allowing and denying reviews for specific roles

To allow a user to review requests for certain roles but not others, edit the
following role fields:

- `allow.review_requests.roles`
- `allow.review_requests.claims_to_roles`
- `deny.review_requests.roles`
- `deny.review_requests.claims_to_roles`

The Auth Service evaluates the `claims_to_roles` field using template
expressions with the user's traits. See the [Role
Templates](../guides/role-templates.mdx#templating-in-access-requests) for more
information on how Teleport executes template expressions with user traits in
the `claims_to_roles` field.

For a user to review an Access Request for a particular role, at least one allow
rule must grant the user access to review requests for that role. No deny rule
must disallow access to review that role.

### `where` expressions

Unlike the `requests.roles` and `requests.claims_to_roles` fields, the
`review_requests.roles` and `review_requests.claims_to_roles` fields allow you
to grant or deny permissions to review an Access Request for a role based on a
`where` expression. If the expression holds for an Access Request, Teleport
applies the allow or deny rules for the `review_requests_claims_to_roles` and
`review_requests.roles` fields.

For example, the following configuration allows a reviewer to review requests
for all roles *unless* the role is `contractor-prod` and the request reason is
empty:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: reviewer
# ...
allow:
  review_requests:
    roles: ['*']
deny:
  review_requests:
    roles: ['contractor-prod']
    where: 'request.reason == ""'
```

When validating an Access Request review, Teleport considers each `where`
expression within all of a reviewer's roles. If one `where` expression holds for
the review, Teleport ensures that the reviewer is authorized to review requests
for the corresponding roles, which are defined in the same Teleport role as the
`where` expression.

If a user is requesting the `contractor-prod` role, for example, and leaves an
empty reason in the request, a user with the `reviewer` role defined above will
not be able to review the request.

`where` expressions can draw on the following data associated with an Access
Request:

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`reviewer.roles`|`[]string`|The reviewer's Teleport roles.|
|`reviewer.traits`|`map[string][]string`|The reviewer's Teleport traits.|
|`request.roles`|`[]string`|The roles requested by the Access Request.|
|`request.reason`|`string`|The reason for the request.|
|`request.system_annotations`|`map[string][]string`|[Request annotations](#request-annotations).|

You can use these fields in expressions that include the following operators and
functions:

|Operator/Function|Description|
|---|---|
|`equals(val1,val2)`|Returns `true` if `val1` is equal to `val2` and `false` otherwise|
|`contains(list, item)`|Returns `true` if `list` contains an exact match for `item`.|
|`regexp.match(list, re)`|Returns `true` if `list` contains a match for `re`.|
|`expr1 && expr2`|Evaluates to `true` if both `expr1` and `expr2` evaluate to `true`.|
|`expr1 \|\| expr2`|Evaluates to `true` if `expr1`, `expr2`, or both evaluate to `true`.|
|`!expr`|Evaluates to the opposite of `expr`.|

Above, any argument named `list` can accept a list of values (like
`request.roles`) or a single value (like `request.reason`).

The `re` argument to `regexp.match` supports both glob-style wildcards (the `*`
character) and [Go-style regular expressions](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp).
If an expression begins with the `^` character and ends with the `$` character,
Teleport will evaluate it as a regular expression.
Otherwise, it will evaluate it as a wildcard expression.
Wildcards match any sequence of zero or more characters.

## Inspecting requested resources

A Teleport user can view information about a resource without having access to
that resource. This is useful for inspecting a resource before granting another
user access to it by approving that user's Access Requests.

To grant or deny a user the ability to list Teleport resources without accessing
them, use the `allow.review_requests.preview_as_roles` and
`deny.review_requests.preview_as_roles` fields in the user's roles:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      roles:
        - access
      preview_as_roles:
        - access
```

When a user attempts to list Teleport resources, for example, by using a `tsh
ls` command, the Teleport Auth Service checks whether the user's
`preview_as_roles` grant access to list the resource and, if so, lists the
resources. This also applies to users attempting to list Kubernetes resources
protected by Teleport, such as deployments and pods.

Without the ability to preview a resource, reviewers can only see the resource's
UUID as provided by the Access Request.

## Request annotations

When a user creates an Access Request, the Teleport Auth Service can write
arbitrary metadata to the request. Teleport integrations that consume the access
request can read the metadata in order to direct their behavior.

Annotations are key value pairs in which a single key corresponds to a list of
values. All values are strings.

### Plugins that support request annotations

The following Teleport-supported Access Request plugins read request
annotations:

|Integration|Annotation keys|How it uses annotations|
|---|---|---|
|Pagerduty|`pagerduty_notify_service`, `pagerduty_services`|Opens an incident in the service named in `pagerduty_notify_service` when a user submits an Access Request. If a user is on the on-call rotation for a service named in `pagerduty_services`, Teleport will approve any Access Request opened by the user.|
|Opsgenie|`teleport.dev/notify-services`, `teleport.dev/schedules`|The integration approves a user's Access Request if the user is on call for the of the services listed in `teleport.dev/schedules`. It also creates an alert in the services named in `teleport.dev/notify-services` when a user creates an Access Request. |
|ServiceNow|`teleport.dev/notify-services`, `teleport.dev/schedules`|The integration approves a user's Access Request if the user is on call for the of the services listed in `teleport.dev/schedules`. It also creates an alert in the services named in `teleport.dev/notify-services` when a user creates an Access Request. |

### Allowing and denying annotations

The Teleport Auth Service evaluates Access Request annotations in a user's roles
by applying the following logic: for all allowed annotation values with a given
key, check whether there is also a denied annotation value with the same key. If
there is, skip it. Otherwise, add the annotation to the Access Request.

For example, let's say we have defined a role with the following fields:

```yaml
allow:
  request:
    annotations:
      pagerduty_services:
        - data-writer
        - data-reader
```

We have also defined a role with these fields:

```yaml
deny:
  request:
    annotations:
      pagerduty_services:
        - data-reader
```

In this case, the final annotation mapping for the user's Access Requests would
contain the annotation:

```yaml
pagerduty_services:
 - data-writer
```

### Reading annotations in custom plugins

If you [write your own Access Request plugin](../../api/access-plugin.mdx), the
program can access system annotations using a function similar to the following:

```go
func getMyAnnotation(req types.AccessRequest) ([]string, error) {
	result, ok := req.GetSystemAnnotations()["my-annotation"]
	if !ok {
		return nil, trace.NotFound("annotation not found")
	}
	return result, nil
}
```

This function uses the `GetSystemAnnotations` method of the
`types.AccessRequest` type to get all the annotation values of an Access
Requests with the key `my-annotation`.

Reference](../reference.mdx).
