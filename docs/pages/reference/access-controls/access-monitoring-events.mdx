The Access Monitoring event reference includes a list of Access Monitoring
events that you can query and view in reports, along with examples of @tctl@
commands you can run to query each event.

Access Monitoring tracks a subset of Teleport audit events that are relevant to
identifying unusual access patterns. To view a comprehensive set of events,
visit the [Investigate](../../identity-security/usage/investigate.mdx) view of
Teleport Identity Security. For a reference of all audit events you can track
with Teleport, see the [Audit Event Reference](../audit-events.mdx).
