title: SAML Identity Provider Reference
description: Reference documentation for the SAML identity provider
---

This page provides details on the SAML identity provider available
in Teleport.

## What is the SAML identity provider?

The SAML identity provider allows Teleport users to authenticate and
authorize to external applications, both inside and outside of Teleport,
that support SAML Single Sign-On.

## Basic definitions

The following definitions are paraphrased and summarized from OASIS's SAML
specification documents, referenced at the bottom of this page.

### Assertions

A package of information that supplies zero or more statements made by an
identity provider. Assertions are usually made about a subject, which in
Teleport's case will be Teleport users. These can be viewed as statements of
fact about a user, e.g. "user *bob* belongs to roles *editor*, *access*."

### Service Provider

A service provider can make use of assertions about a subject in order to control
access and provide customized service. They rely on the **identity provider** for
these assertions. In Teleport's case, service providers are typically applications
like Slack, Vercel, etc. that allow SAML Single Sign-On.

### Identity Provider

A service that makes assertions about a subject.

### Service/identity provider initiated SSO

The login process can be initiated by either the service provider or the identity
provider. The processes to trigger either of these are subtly different. The
service provider is responsible for initiating the SSO process for service
provider initiated SSO. The identity provider is responsible for initiating
the process for identity provider initiated SSO.

## Endpoints

### Metadata URL

`https://<proxy-address>/enterprise/saml-idp/metadata`

This is the URL where the identity provider XML metadata can be retrieved from.
Service providers will require information from this file to establish the
trust between the service provider and identity provider.

### Single Sign-On Service URL

`https://<proxy-address>/enterprise/saml-idp/sso`

This is the URL that service providers will use to exchange assertions with the
identity provider. This URL supports the following bindings:

- `HTTP-Redirect`
- `HTTP-POST`

### Identity provider initiated SSO URL

`https://<proxy-address>/enterprise/saml-idp/login/<sp-name>`

This URL triggers identity provider initiated SSO. `sp-name` matches the
`metadata.name` of the service provider object for a particular service provider.

## Teleport SAML service provider object

Below is a service provider object. These objects must be added to Teleport in
order for Teleport to trust external service providers.

```yaml
kind: saml_idp_service_provider
metadata:
  # The friendly name of the service provider. This is used to manage the
  # service provider as well as in identity provider initiated SSO.
  name: saml-service-provider
spec:
  # The entity_descriptor is the service provider XML.
  entity_descriptor: |
    <md:EntityDescriptor xmlns:md="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata"...
version: v1
```

## Assertions

The assertions currently provided by Teleport's SAML identity provider are listed below.

| Friendly name          | Full name                           | Description               | Format                                            |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `uid`                  | `urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1` | The user ID from Teleport | `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri` |
| `eduPersonAffiliation` | `urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.1`  | The user's Teleport roles | `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri` |

## RBAC

In role version 7 and below, the following access controls are applied to the `saml_idp_service_provider` resource access: 

- Role option that enables idp: `spec.options.idp.saml.enabled: true/false`.
- Cluster auth preference that enables idp: `spec.idp.saml.enabled: true/false`.
- Resource rule `spec.allow/deny.rules.resources.saml_idp_service_provider`. Applicable only to admin actions. 
  - Allow rule with `read,list` verbs are applied implicitly. 
  - Deny rule with `read,list` verbs gets precedence over implicit allow. 
- Per session MFA: `spec.options.require_session_mfa: true/false`.

Teleport role version 8 introduces the following changes:
- Label matchers based on `app_labels`.
- Resource rule with verbs targeting `saml_idp_service_provider` is now applicable to both resource access and admin actions. 
- Device Trust for SAML IdP session.

The role option `spec.options.idp.saml.enabled: true/false` is no longer supported starting role version 8.

Per session MFA is supported in all role versions.

### RBAC precedence

Users can be assigned with both the newer role (version 8) and the older versioned roles (version 7 and below) at the same time.
If a user is assigned with both role version 7 and 8, deny rules of the version 8 takes precedence.

For example,
- If role version 7 denies access, access is denied.
- If role version 7 allows access but role version 8 denies access, access is denied. 
- If role version 7 allows access and role version 8 also allows access, access is allowed.

The table below shows a few more examples of applicable RBAC, when two roles with version 7 and 8 each are assigned to the user.

| Role v7                                                                    | Role v8                                                    |  Result           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| <pre>options:<br/>  idp:<br/>    saml:<br/>      enabled: false</pre>      | <pre>allow:<br/>  app_labels:<br/>    * : *</pre>          | ❌ no access.      |
| <pre>options:<br/>  idp:<br/>    saml:<br/>      enabled: true</pre>       | <pre>deny:<br/>  app_labels:<br/>     * : *</pre>          | ❌ no access       |  
| <pre>options:<br/>  idp:<br/>    saml:<br/>      enabled: true</pre>       | <pre>allow:<br/>  app_labels:<br/>    * : *<br/>deny:<br/>  rules:<br/>    resources:<br/>    - saml_idp_service_provider<br/>    verbs:<br/>    - read<br/>    - list</pre>          | ❌ no access     | 
| <pre>options:<br/>  idp:<br/>    saml:<br/>      enabled: true</pre>       | <pre>allow:<br/>  app_labels:<br/>    * : *</pre>          | ✅ full access     | 
| No version 7 role assigned to the user                                     | <pre>allow:<br/>  app_labels:<br/>    * : *</pre>          | ✅ full access     | 
| <pre>options:<br/>  idp:<br/>    saml:<br/>      enabled: true</pre>       | No version 8 role assigned to the user           | ✅ full access     | 

<Admonition type="important" title="Admin Actions">
 `saml_idp_service_provider` resource does not yet support MFA and Device Trust for admin actions. 
</Admonition>

## Disabling SAML identity provider at cluster level

To disable access to the identity provider at the cluster level, create
or update the `cluster_auth_preference` object with the following setting:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  ...
  idp:
    saml:
      enabled: false
  ...
version: v2
```

This will disable access to the SAML identity provider for all users regardless
of their role level permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### `Bad Request` when logging into an external application

If the Teleport server returns a `Bad Request` the service provider metadata may not
have been added properly to Teleport and, as a result, Teleport is unable to find the
service provider. You can verify this by looking for a log entry in Teleport's logs:

```code
2023-03-01T10:32:34-05:00 INFO [SAMLIDP]   failed to validate request: cannot find service provider https://samltest.id/saml/sp: could not find service provider https://samltest.id/saml/sp pid:31036.1 saml@v0.4.12/identity_provider.go:232
```
