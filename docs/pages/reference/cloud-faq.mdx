This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about Teleport
Enterprise (Cloud). For a list of frequently asked questions about Teleport in
general, see [Frequently Asked Questions](../faq.mdx).

## Billing and usage

### How does Cloud Billing work?

Please [reach out to sales](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise) to discuss pricing.

### Can a customer deploy multiple clusters in Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

[Reach out to sales](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise) to discuss pricing.

### If I start with Teleport Enterprise Cloud, can I move to Teleport Enterprise or Teleport Community Edition, or do I need to start again?

If you plan to use S3 and DynamoDB as storage backends, we can provide data for you to import. But you should reach out to us first. If you use a different backend, you will need to start over.

## Security

### How long will Teleport Enterprise Cloud retain my data?

See our documentation on [data retention](architecture/teleport-cloud-architecture.mdx).

### Is an independent security audit available?

Security audits by independent third-parties are performed at least annually. You can request audit results and other
related information on the [Teleport Trust Portal](https://trust.goteleport.com).

### Does your SOC 2 report include Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

### How do you store passwords?

Password hashes are generated using [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).

### Do you encrypt data at rest?

Each deployment is using at-rest encryption using Amazon DynamoDB and S3 at-rest encryption
for customer data including session recordings and user records.

### Can I get a list of IP addresses that my infrastructure will need to allow connections to?

See the [Public IP Address Allowlist](../ips.mdx) for the list of IP addresses used for inbound connections to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

### Can I configure a list of IP addresses which are allowed to connect to Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

We do not have plans to offer support for inbound connection IP allowlists.

We believe mTLS with strong user and [device identity](../identity-governance/device-trust/guide.mdx) provides the best available
security for client authentication.

For customers that require IP-based control for compliance purposes, we do
support IP Pinning. For more information see `pin_source_ip` in our [Teleport
Access Controls Reference](access-controls/roles.mdx).

### Are internal connections encrypted / authenticated?

Teleport components communicate with themselves using mTLS, with a separate certificate authority for each tenant. Connections to AWS services, such as DynamoDB and
S3, are established using encryption provided by AWS, both at rest and in transit. Each tenant has its own credentials that isolate it to interacting with only its own data.
## Connecting resources

### How do I add resources to Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

You can connect servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases, desktops, and
applications using [reverse
tunnels](../enroll-resources/agents/agents.mdx).

There is no need to open any ports on your infrastructure for inbound traffic.

### What is the maximum number of agents a customer can connect to their cluster?

If you plan on connecting more than 10,000 nodes or agents, please contact your account executive or customer support to ensure your tenant is properly scaled.

### Should we use Enterprise or Teleport Community Edition for connecting resources to our Teleport cluster?
(!docs/pages/includes/ent-vs-community-faq.mdx!)

### Are dynamic node tokens available?

After [connecting](#how-can-i-access-the-tctl-admin-tool) `tctl` to Teleport Enterprise Cloud, users can generate
[dynamic tokens](../enroll-resources/agents/join-token.mdx):

```code
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node,proxy --token=$(uuid)
```

## Using `tctl`

### How can I access the `tctl` admin tool?

Find the appropriate download at [Installation](../installation.mdx).

After downloading the tools, first log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl` remotely:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=example.teleport.sh
$ tctl status
```

### Why am I getting `permission denied` errors when using `tctl`?

If you have a local file `/etc/teleport.yaml` on your machine `tctl` will attempt to use the local cluster. Set the environment variable `TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE` to `""` so it will not attempt to use that Teleport configuration file.

```code
$ export TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE=""
$ tctl tokens add --type=node
```

## Audit events and session recordings

### Is there a way to forward Teleport Enterprise Cloud audit events to my company's internal Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)?

Yes. We recommend Teleport's [event handler plugin](../admin-guides/management/export-audit-events/fluentd.mdx) to export Teleport Enterprise Cloud audit events.

### Is it possible to store audit logs and session recordings in my own S3 bucket?

Yes, you can configure [External Audit Storage](../admin-guides/management/external-audit-storage.mdx).

### Is it possible to enable proxy recording mode?

Proxy recording mode is disabled for cloud customers

### Is there a way to download session recordings for easy playback?

The ability to download recordings for offline viewing will be available in a future release.

## Updates

### Will Teleport be updated automatically?

If you have Teleport Agents connected to a Teleport Enterprise Cloud cluster
that are more than one major version behind, you might experience compatibility
issues unless your Teleport Agents are enrolled in automatic updates. See the [Upgrading
Overview](../upgrading/overview.mdx) for more information.

To get version information for your Teleport Agents, see [How can I find version information on
connected agents?](#how-can-i-find-version-information-on-connected-agents).

If you want more details about cluster updates, see [Cloud Cluster Updates](../upgrading/cloud-cluster-updates.mdx).

For more information about automatic updates and compatibility issues, contact
[Teleport support](https://goteleport.com/support/).

### Why wasn't my Teleport Enterprise Cloud cluster upgraded to the latest major version?

The Teleport control plane supports Teleport Agents that are on the same major version or one major version behind.
If your Teleport Agents are not up to date, we will withhold major version upgrades in order to prevent connectivity
issues to your resources. For example, if your control plane is currently running Teleport 15 and you have Teleport Agents
running Teleport 14, we will not be able to upgrade your control plane to Teleport 16 until all Teleport Agents are
running Teleport 15.

You can check the status of your Teleport Agent versions from the `tctl inventory ls` command. `Auth` and `Proxy`
services are those managed by Teleport. See [How can I find version information on
connected agents?](#how-can-i-find-version-information-on-connected-agents) for further detail.

### Are updates times configurable for Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

Yes, see [Cloud Cluster Updates](../upgrading/cloud-cluster-updates.mdx#maintenance-windows) for further instruction.

### When are agents automatically updated?

Teleport Enterprise Cloud must be set to receive automatic updates to use the
Teleport Cloud version server for automatic agent updates. With automatic agent
updates, agents periodically check the version server for new releases and
update the software when new versions are found.

If you enroll in automatic agent updates, Teleport Agents are automatically
updated after your Teleport cluster is updated during your scheduled maintenance
period. For more information, read the [Automatic Agent
Updates](../upgrading/agent-managed-updates.mdx) guide.

### How can I find version information on connected agents?

You can check the status of your agents' version from the `tctl inventory ls` command. `Auth` and `Proxy`
services are those managed by Teleport.

```code
$ tctl inventory ls
Server ID                            Hostname              Services        Agent Version Upgrader Upgrader Version

```

## Architecture and networking

### Which Proxy Service ports are open on my Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant?

Teleport Enterprise Cloud allocates a different set of ports to each tenant. To see which
ports are available for your Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant, run a command similar to the
following, replacing `example.teleport.sh` with your tenant domain:

```code
$ curl https://example.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.proxy'
```

The output should resemble the following, including the unique ports assigned to
your tenant:

```json
{
  "kube": {
    "enabled": true,
    "public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11107",
    "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3026"
  },
  "ssh": {
    "listen_addr": "[::]:3023",
    "tunnel_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3024",
    "public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:443",
    "ssh_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11105",
    "ssh_tunnel_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11106"
  },
  "db": {
    "postgres_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11109",
    "mysql_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3036",
    "mysql_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11108"
  },
  "tls_routing_enabled": true
}
```

This output also indicates whether TLS routing is enabled for your tenant. When
TLS routing is enabled, connections to a Teleport service (e.g., the Teleport
SSH Service) are routed through the Proxy Service's public web address, rather
than through a port allocated to that service.

In this case, you can see that TLS routing is enabled, and that the Proxy
Service's public web address (`ssh.public_addr`) is `example.teleport.sh:443`.

Read more in our [TLS Routing](architecture/tls-routing.mdx) guide.

### How does Teleport manage web certificates? Can I upload my own?

Teleport uses [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) to issue
certificates for every customer. It is not possible to upload a custom
certificate or use a custom domain name.

### Where does Teleport Enterprise Cloud run?

Teleport Cloud runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We run proxies in a variety
of regions all over the world, and allow customers to [select the region](architecture/teleport-cloud-architecture.mdx) where the data is stored.

### Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?

We use AWS-managed keys. Currently there is no option to provide your own key.

### Is this Teleport's S3 bucket, or my bucket based on my AWS credentials?

It's a Teleport-managed S3 bucket with AWS-managed keys by default.

Configuring [External Audit Storage](../admin-guides/management/external-audit-storage.mdx) will allow
you to use your own S3 bucket.

### Is IPv6 Supported for connections to Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

We don't currently support IPv6 connections to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

### Can I change the domain name of my Cloud instance after it's been created?

We're currently researching whether this can be done, so please contact support at support@goteleport.com.

### Is FIPS mode an option?

FIPS is not currently an option for Teleport Enterprise Cloud clusters.


## Performance and reliability

### Can I use Teleport Enterprise Cloud in production?

Yes. Large organizations leverage Teleport Enterprise Cloud to manage the vast number of resources in their organization. Teleport Enterprise Cloud is audited regularly to ensure the most reliable and secure service possible is available to our customers.

### What is the Cloud SLA?

Teleport Enterprise Cloud commits to an SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=) of monthly uptime,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month. While we routinely exceed this SLA,
this number reflects risks in our architecture that we will improve over time.

### Is there a status page available?

Check the current and historical status of Teleport Cloud at
[status.teleport.sh](https://status.teleport.sh).  From the status page, click **Subscribe to Updates**
to get email notifications about scheduled maintenances or updates in service health.

### Can I get push notifications of Teleport Enterprise Cloud downtime?

Yes. Customers can subscribe to Teleport Enterprise Cloud updates at [status.teleport.sh](https://status.teleport.sh).

### Can I retrieve diagnostics from my hosted cluster?

We currently don't expose any metrics interfaces for a tenant.

For our own metrics collection, we're rolling out mTLS, so that only authorized internal clients may collect or scrape metrics from the running instances.
This design does not include a mechanism to issue mTLS certificates to external clients, while maintaining isolation guarantees that one tenant cannot interact with another tenant.

Teleport cloud tenants are made up of a cluster of processes, with designated processes sitting behind a load balancer. To scrape the entire cluster would require each component of
the Teleport cluster to be individually addressable and accessible from external sources. This could allow individual components to be selectively attacked, if an adversary is able to
address traffic to any individual software instance within the cluster.

### How do I set up recovery codes for my account so I don't lose access?

When you sign up for a Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) account and set up your first
user within the account, the Teleport Web UI displays a set of recovery codes:

![Web UI view showing Teleport recovery
codes](../../img/cloud/recovery-codes.png)

Save the recovery codes into a safe location, such as your organization's
password manager. You can use these codes to reset your account if you lose
your password or multi-factor authentication credentials.
