description: "Signals you can send to a running teleport process."

You can send the following signals to a `teleport` process to trigger different
functionality.

To send a signal, execute the following command on the host where `teleport` is
running, replacing `SIG` with the name of the signal.

```code
$ kill -SIG
```

| Signal | Teleport Daemon Behavior |
| - | - |
| `USR1` | Dumps diagnostics/debugging information into syslog. |
| `QUIT`| Graceful shutdown. The daemon will wait until connections are dropped. |
| `TERM` , `INT` or `KILL` | Immediate non-graceful shutdown. All existing connections will be dropped. |
| `USR2` | Forks a new Teleport daemon to serve new connections. |
| `HUP` | Forks a new Teleport daemon to serve new connections **and** initiates the graceful shutdown of the existing process when there are no more clients connected to it. |
