title: Application Access Role-Based Access Control
description: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Teleport application access.
---

This article describes access control concepts particularly relevant to the
Teleport Application Service.

## Assigning labels to applications

The Teleport Application Service uses labels to control access to the proxied
web applications.

Teleport administrators can assign static and dynamic labels to apps using
configuration:

```yaml
apps:
- name: "grafana"
  uri: "http://localhost:3000"
  # Static labels.
  labels:
    env: "prod"
    group: "metrics"
  # Teleport periodically executes commands in dynamic labels and uses the
  # commands output in label values.
  commands:
  - name: "arch"
    command: ["uname", "-p"]
    period: 1m0s
```

## Configuring application labels in roles

Teleport administrators can configure roles to allow or deny users' access to
applications with specific labels using `app_labels` property.

For example, this role will grant access to all applications from the group
"metrics", except for the production ones:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      group: "metrics"
  deny:
    app_labels:
      env: "prod"
```

## Integrating with identity providers

You can configure roles to populate app labels dynamically based on the user's
claims and attributes received from identity providers. This is done by using
template variables with `external` prefix.

For example, this role will have its `env` and `group` label values set after
the Okta user's attributes with the same names:

```yaml
allow:
  app_labels:
    env: "{{external.env}}"
    group: "{{external.group}}"
```

## Enabling a user to access Azure managed identities

You can authorize your Teleport user to assume an Azure identity and execute
Azure CLI commands via Teleport. To do so, define a role with the
`spec.allow.azure_identities` field, as shown below:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure

```

Modify the `spec.allow.azure_identities` field so that each item is the full URI
of an Azure managed identity that you would like to enable users with this role
to assume. The example above allows the user to assume the `teleport-azure`
identity. 

Another approach is to define a user's permitted Azure identities by configuring
each user separately. To do so, create a role with one element within
`azure_identities` set to the template variable `{{internal.azure_identities}}`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - '{{internal.azure_identities}}'
```

In this case, when a user authenticates to the Azure CLI via Teleport, the
Teleport Auth Service populates the `{{internal.azure_identities}}` template
variable with any Azure identities you have assigned to the user.

To assign Azure identities to a user, run a `tctl users update` command similar
to the following:

```code
$ tctl users update myuser --set-azure-identities \
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/id1,\
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/id2
```

This command uses the `--set-azure-identities` flag to add Azure identities to a
user. The value of this flag is a comma-separated list of Azure identity URIs.

CLI](./cloud-apis/azure.mdx#step-34-enable-your-user-to-access-azure-clis) guide
