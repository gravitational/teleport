title: tbot Chart Reference
description: Values that can be set using the tbot Helm chart
---

This chart deploys an instance of the [MachineID](../../enroll-resources/machine-id/introduction.mdx) agent,
TBot, into your Kubernetes cluster.

To use it, you will need to know:

- The address of your Teleport Proxy Service or Auth Service
- The name of your Teleport cluster
- The name of a join token configured for Machine ID and your Kubernetes cluster
  as described in the [Machine ID on Kubernetes guide](../../enroll-resources/machine-id/deployment/kubernetes.mdx)

By default, this chart is designed to use the `kubernetes` join method but it
can be customized to use any delegated join method. We do not recommend that
you use the `token` join method with this chart.

## Minimal configuration

This basic configuration will write a Teleport identity file to a secret in
the deployment namespace called `test-output`.

```yaml
clusterName: "test.teleport.sh"
teleportProxyAddress: "test.teleport.sh:443"
defaultOutput:
  secretName: "test-output"
token: "my-token"
```
