title: teleport-kube-agent Chart Reference
description: Values that can be set using the teleport-kube-agent Helm chart
---

The `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart is used to configure a Teleport agent that
runs in a remote Kubernetes cluster to provide access to resources in your
infrastructure.

You can [browse the source on
GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/examples/chart/teleport-kube-agent).

This reference details available values for the `teleport-kube-agent` chart.

## What the chart deploys

### Teleport services

The `teleport-kube-agent` chart can run any or all of three Teleport services:

| Teleport service                                                          | Name for `roles` and `tctl tokens add` | Purpose                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`kubernetes_service`](../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)          | `kube`                                 | Uses Teleport to handle authentication<br/> with and proxy access to a Kubernetes cluster    |
| [`application_service`](../../enroll-resources/application-access/guides.mdx)              | `app`                                  | Uses Teleport to handle authentication<br/> with and proxy access to web-based applications  |
| [`database_service`](../../enroll-resources/database-access/guides.mdx)                    | `db`                                   | Uses Teleport to handle authentication<br/> with and proxy access to databases               |
| [`discovery_service`](../../enroll-resources/auto-discovery/auto-discovery.mdx)              | `discovery`                            | Uses Teleport to discover new resources<br/> and dynamically add them to the cluster         |
| [`jamf_service`](../../admin-guides/access-controls/device-trust/jamf-integration.mdx) | `jamf`                                 | Uses Teleport to integrate with Jamf Pro<br/> and sync devices with Device Trust inventory   |

### Legacy releases

Releases of this chart installed before version 11 are considered legacy
releases, which launch the Teleport pod as a `Deployment` if no storage was
configured.

In version 11 and above, the chart launches the Teleport pod as a `StatefulSet`
even when the chart is configured not to use external storage, and the Teleport pod
reads its state from a Kubernetes `Secret`.

While the Teleport pod does not require external storage, you can still use the
[`storage.enabled`](#storageenabled) field to configure the way the Teleport pod
reads data from a persistent volume.

To learn how upgrading from a legacy release to version 11 will affect
resources launched by this chart, see the [resource
list](#kubernetes-resources).

### Kubernetes resources

The `teleport-kube-agent` chart deploys the following Kubernetes resources:

| Kind                  | Default Name                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | When Deployed                                                                                                     |
