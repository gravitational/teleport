title: teleport-access-graph Chart Reference
description: Values that can be set using the teleport-access-graph Helm chart
---

The `teleport-access-graph` Helm chart deploys the Access Graph service.

See [Teleport Teleport Identity Security's Access Graph on Self-Hosted Clusters with Helm](../../admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/access-graph/self-hosted-helm.mdx)
for more details.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Version Compatibility">
The chart is versioned with the Access Graph service. No compatibility
guarantees are ensured if the service and chart versions differ.
It is strongly recommended to always align the chart and service versions
by using the `--version` Helm flag.
</Admonition>
