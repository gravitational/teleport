The `teleport-relay` Helm chart is used to deploy a Teleport Relay Service group in a Kubernetes cluster, to provide connectivity between clients and resources without involving the Teleport control plane in the network path.

The `teleport-relay` chart is available for Teleport v18.3.0 and later.

You can [browse the source on
GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/examples/chart/teleport-relay).

This reference details available values for the `teleport-relay` chart.

<Admonition type="warning">

The Teleport Relay service provides alternate network paths for accessing resources through Teleport in specific scenarios where clients and agents are in the same network segment and there is a need for connectivity that does not go through the Teleport control plane. It is not a required or recommended cluster component in most Teleport deployments.

If you want to provide access to resources like Databases, Applications or Kubernetes clusters, you should use the [`teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart](teleport-kube-agent.mdx) instead.

## What the chart deploys

The `teleport-relay` chart deploys the following Kubernetes resources:

| Kind | Default name | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `Deployment` | The release name | One or more replicas of the Teleport instance running the Relay Service |
| `Service` | The release name | The transport and tunnel servers, pointed at the respective listeners of the Relay Service replicas. |
| `ConfigMap` | The release name | The Teleport configuration. |
| `Secret` | `joinTokenSecret.name`, if given, or the release name | The join token name, used to join the cluster. It's possible to use an existing `Secret` that's managed outside of the chart. |
| `ServiceAccount` | `serviceAccount.name`, if given, or the release name | Used for the `kubernetes` join method. It's possible to use an existing `ServiceAccount` that's managed outside of the chart. |
| `PodDisruptionBudget` | The release name | Ensures high availability for the Teleport pods. |
