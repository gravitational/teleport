This glossary provides definitions and explanations for key terms related to Teleport Agent services and clients. Teleport Agent runs on target systems to facilitate secure access through the Teleport cluster.

# Teleport Agent services and clients

Most agent services can be enabled together or separately depending on deployment needs.

The **"Enabled by Default"** column indicates whether each service is active by default when you run `teleport start` without specifying services.

## Teleport Agent services

| Service Name  | Description   | Common Use Case  | Enabled by Default |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `auth_service` | Core authentication and certificate authority service. | Central identity and policy engine  | ✅ |
| `proxy_service` | Routes client requests and handles access to Teleport clusters and resources. | Public access point for users and workloads | ✅ |
| `ssh_service` | Provides SSH access to Linux servers with auditing and session recording. | Secure access to Linux nodes | ✅ |
| `kubernetes_service` | Provides secure, audited access to Kubernetes clusters. | Access control and session tracking for Kubernetes | ❌ |
| `app_service` | Provides secure access to internal web applications.                           | Protect internal tools and dashboards | ❌ |
| `db_service` | Manages identity-aware access to databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB). | Role-based database access with auditing | ❌ |
| `discovery_service` | Automatically discovers and joins cloud resources (e.g., EC2, Azure VMs). | Auto-enroll infrastructure | ❌ |
| `windows_desktop_service` | Enables RDP access to Windows desktops through Teleport. | Access control and recording for Windows systems | ❌ |
| `jamf_service` | Integrates with Jamf for device trust enforcement. | Verify macOS device compliance before login | ❌ |
| `debug_service` | Exposes internal metrics and debug endpoints for diagnostics. | Development, profiling, and debugging | ✅ |

## Teleport clients

| Client tool | Description | Common use case |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `tsh` | Command-line tool for users to authenticate, connect to resources, and manage sessions. | CLI-based access for engineers and operators |
| `tctl` | Administrative CLI for managing roles, users, configurations, and resources. | Cluster setup and ongoing admin operations |
| `tbot` | Lightweight agent that provisions credentials to workloads and CI/CD pipelines. | Machine and workload authentication |
| Teleport Connect | GUI application for accessing servers, databases, apps, and desktops.  GUI-based daily access for engineers | GUI-based daily access for engineers |

- The `tbot` agent is often deployed in non-interactive environments to bootstrap access securely.
- All client tools ultimately interact with the Auth and Proxy services, which serve as the backbone of the Teleport platform.
