## Okta Import Rule resources

Full YAML spec of Okta import rule resources managed by `tctl` resource commands:

(!docs/pages/includes/okta-import-rule.mdx!)

You can create a new `okta_import_rule` resource by running the following commands, which
assume that you have created a YAML file called `okta-import-rule.yaml` with your configuration:

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
# Create the resource
$ tctl create -f okta-import-rule.yaml
```

## Okta Assignment resources

These objects are internally facing and are not intended to be modified by users. However,
you can query them for informational or debugging purposes.

Full YAML spec of Okta assignment resources queried by `tctl` resource commands:

```yaml
kind: okta_assignment
version: v1
metadata:
  name: test-assignment
spec:
  # The user that the Okta assignment is granting access for.
  user: test-user@test.user
  # The list of targets to grant access to.
  targets:
  # An application target.
  - type: application
    id: "123456"
  # A group target.
  - type: group
    id: "234567"
  # The current status of the Okta assignment.
  status: pending
```

## CLI

This section shows CLI commands relevant for managing Okta Service behaviors.

### tctl get okta_import_rules

Lists available Okta import rules.

```code
$ tctl get okta_import_rules
```

### tctl get okta_import_rules/NAME

Gets an individual Okta import rule.

```code
$ tctl get okta_import_rules/my-import-rule
```

### tctl rm okta_import_rules/NAME

Removes an individual Okta import rule.

```code
$ tctl rm okta_import_rules/my-import-rule
```

### tctl get okta_assignments

Lists available Okta assignments.

```code
$ tctl get okta_assignments
```

### tctl get okta_assignments/NAME

Gets an individual Okta assignment.

```code
$ tctl get okta_assignments/my-assignment
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Okta groups or applications seen in the Teleport UI

If the Teleport applications UI isn't displaying any Okta applications, ensure
that the Okta API token and endpoint are correct in the Okta service.

If they are, double check the user permissions and ensure that the user has
appropriate resource and label level access to the groups and applications. You
may need to tweak the `app_labels` and `group_labels` sections of a role in order
to see these resources.
