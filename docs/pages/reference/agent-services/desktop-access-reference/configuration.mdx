`teleport.yaml` fields related to desktop access:

```yaml
# Main service responsible for desktop access.
#
# You can have multiple Desktop Service instances in your cluster (but not in the
# same teleport.yaml), connected to the same or different Active Directory
# domains.
(!docs/pages/includes/config-reference/desktop-config.yaml!)
```

## Deployment

The Windows Desktop Service can be deployed in two modes.

### Direct mode

In *direct* mode, Windows Desktop Services registers directly with the Teleport
Auth Service, and listens for desktop connections from the Teleport Proxy. To
enable direct mode, set `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` in
`teleport.yaml`, and ensure that `teleport.auth_server` points directly at the
Auth Service.

Direct mode requires network connectivity both:

- from the Teleport Proxy to the Windows Desktop Service.
- from the Windows Desktop Service to the Auth Service.

For these reasons direct mode is not available in Teleport cloud, only
self-hosted Teleport clusters.

### IoT mode (reverse tunnel)

In *IoT mode*, Windows Desktop Service only needs to be able to make an outbound
connection to a Teleport Proxy. The Windows Desktop Service establishes a
reverse tunnel to the proxy, and both registration with the Auth Service and
desktop sessions are performed over this tunnel. To enable this mode, ensure
that `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` is *unset*, and point
`teleport.proxy_server` at a Teleport Proxy.

## Screen size

By default, Teleport will set the screen size of the remote desktop session
based on the size of your browser window. In some cases, you may wish to
configure specific hosts to use a specific screen size. To do this, set the
`screen_size` attribute on the `windows_desktop` resource:

```yaml
kind: windows_desktop
metadata:
  name: fixed-screen-size
spec:
  host_id: 307e091b-7f6b-42e0-b78d-3362ad10b55d
  addr: 192.168.1.153:3389
  non_ad: true

  # Optional - ensures that all sessions use the same screen size,
  # no matter what the size of the browser window is.
  # Leave blank to use the size of the browser window.
  screen_size:
    width: 1024
    height: 768
```
