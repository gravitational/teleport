description: Configuration and CLI reference for Teleport MCP access.
---

This guide describes interfaces and options for interacting with the Teleport
Application Service for MCP access, including the static configuration file for
the `teleport` binary, and `tsh mcp` commands.

## Configuration

(!docs/pages/includes/backup-warning.mdx!)

The following snippet shows the full YAML configuration of an Application Service
appearing in the `teleport.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
app_service:
  # Enables application proxy service.
  enabled: true
  # Enables the builtin Teleport demo MCP server that shows current user and
  # session information. Wildcard must be allowed for "app_labels" by your role
  # to access this MCP server.
  mcp_demo_server: true
  # This section contains definitions of all applications proxied by this
  # service. It can contain multiple items.
  apps:
  # Name of the application. Used for identification purposes.
  - name: "mcp-everything"
    # Free-form application description.
    description: "Example Everything MCP server"
    # Static labels to assign to the app. Used in RBAC.
    labels:
      env: "prod"
    # Contains MCP server-related configurations.
    mcp:
      # Command to launch stdio-based MCP servers.
      command: "docker"
      # Args to execute with the command.
      args: ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/everything"]
      # Name of the host user account under which the command will be
      # executed. Required for stdio-based MCP servers.
      run_as_host_user: "docker"
```

## Resource

The MCP server resources are registered as `app` resources in the Teleport
backend. Here is the spec of MCP server resources managed by `tctl` resource
command:

```yaml
kind: app
version: v3
metadata:
  # MCP server name
  name: everything
  # MCP server description.
  description: The Everything MCP server
  # MCP server labels.
  labels:
    env: local
spec:
  mcp:
    # Command to launch stdio-based MCP servers.
    command: "docker"
    # Args to execute with the command.
    args: ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/everything"]
    # Name of the host user account under which the command will be
    # executed. Required for stdio-based MCP servers.
    run_as_host_user: "docker"
```

## CLI

This section shows CLI commands relevant for MCP access.

### tsh mcp ls

Lists available MCP servers.

```code
# List all MCP servers.
$ tsh mcp ls
# Search MCP servers with keywords.
$ tsh mcp ls --search foo,bar
# Filter MCP servers with labels.
$ tsh mcp ls key1=value1,key2=value2
# Get MCP server names using "jq".
$ tsh mcp ls --format json  | jq -r '.[].metadata.name'
```

| Flag | Description |
| - | - |
| `--search` | List of comma separated search keywords or phrases enclosed in quotations (e.g. `--search=foo,bar,"some phrase"`). |
| `--query`  | Query by predicate language enclosed in single quotes. (e.g. `--query='labels["key1"] == "value1" && labels["key2"] != "value2"')`. |
| `--format` | Format output (`text`, `json`, `yaml`). |

### tsh mcp config

Print client configuration details or update the configuration directly.

```code
# Print sample configuration for a MCP server app
$ tsh mcp config my-mcp-server-app
# Add all MCP servers to Claude Desktop
$ tsh mcp config --all --client-config=claude
# Search MCP servers with labels and add to the specified JSON file
$ tsh mcp config --labels env=dev --client-config=my-config.json`
```

| Flag | Description |
| - | - |
| `--all` | Select all MCP servers. Mutually exclusive with `--labels` or `--query`.|
| `--labels`  | List of comma separated labels to filter by labels (e.g. key1=value1,key2=value2).|
| `--query`  | Query by predicate language enclosed in single quotes. (e.g. `--query='labels["key1"] == "value1" && labels["key2"] != "value2"')`. |
| `--client-config` | If specified, update the specified client config. `claude` for default Claude Desktop config, or specify a JSON file path. Can also be set with environment variable `TELEPORT_MCP_CLIENT_CONFIG`.",
| `--json-format` |	Format the JSON file (`pretty`, `compact`, `auto`, `none`). `auto` saves in compact if the file is already compact, otherwise pretty. Can also be set with environment variable `TELEPORT_MCP_CONFIG_JSON_FORMAT`. Default is `auto`.",

### tsh mcp connect

Used by AI tools such as Claude Desktop to connect to an MCP server via
Teleport.

<Admonition type="tip">
`tsh mcp config` can print sample configuration or update your AI tools
directly. This eliminates the need to manually construct the tsh mcp connect
command.
</Admonition>

```code
$ tsh mcp connect mcp-everything
```

`tsh` debug logs are enabled by default and can be disabled by the environment
variable `TELEPORT_DEBUG=false`. You can also specify the `--no-debug` flag when
generating sample configurations with `tsh mcp config`.
