title: Deploying Machine ID with Bound Keypair Joining
description: "How to install and configure Machine ID with Bound Keypair Joining"
---

In this guide, you will install Machine & Workload Identity's agent, `tbot`, on
an arbitrary host using Bound Keypair Joining. This host could be a bare-metal
machine, a VM, a container, or any other host - the only requirement is that the
host has persistent storage.

Bound Keypair Joining is an improved alternative to
[secret-based join methods][secret] and can function as a drop-in replacement.
It is more secure than static token joining, and is more flexible than ephemeral
token joining with renewable certificates: when its certificates expire, it can
perform an automated recovery to ensure the bot can rejoin even after an
extended outage.

Note that platform-specific join methods may be available that are better suited
to your environment; refer to the
[deployment guides](../../../../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx)
for a full list of options.

## How it works

With Bound Keypair Joining, Machine & Workload Identity bots generate a unique
keypair which is persistently stored in their internal data directory. Teleport
is then configured to trust this public key for future joining attempts.

Later, when the bot attempts to join the cluster, Teleport issues it a challenge
that can only be completed using its private key. The bot returns the solved
challenge, attesting to its own identity, and is conditionally allowed to join
the cluster. This process is repeated for every join attempt, but if the bot has
been offline long enough for its certificates to expire, it is additionally
forced to perform an automatic recovery to join again.

As self attestation is inherently less secure than the external verification
that would be provided by a cloud provider like AWS or a dedicated TPM, Bound
Keypair Joining enforces a number of additional checks to prevent abuse,
including:
- Join state verification to ensure the keypair cannot be usefully shared or
  duplicated
- Certificate generation counter checks to ensure regular bot certificates
  cannot be usefully shared or duplicated
- Configurable limits on how often - if at all - bots may be allowed to
  automatically recover using this keypair

An important benefit to Bound Keypair Joining is that all joining restrictions
can be reconfigured at any time, and bots that expire or go offline can be
recovered by making a server-side exemption without any client-side
intervention.

Refer to the [reference page][reference] for further details on how this join
method works and how to use it in production.

## Prerequisites

{/* note: consider edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx include for v19; it is misleading due to the minor launch release */}

- A running Teleport cluster version 18.1.0 or above.
- The `tsh` and `tctl` clients.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- This guide assumes the bot host has mutable persistent storage for internal
  bot data. While it is possible to use Bound Keypair Joining can on immutable
  hosts (like CI runs), doing so will reduce security guarantees; see the
  [reference page][reference] for further information.

## Step 1/5. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the bot host.**

First, `tbot` needs to be installed on the host that you wish to use Machine ID
on.

Download and install the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/5. Create a Bot

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/5. Create a join token

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

In this guide, we'll demonstrate joining a bot using a registration secret: this
is a one-time use secret the bot can provide to Teleport to authenticate its
first join. Once authenticated, the bot automatically generates a keypair and
registers its public key with Teleport for use in all future join attempts.

Create `token-example.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # This name will be used in tbot's `onboarding.token` field.
  name: example
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name should match the name of the bot created earlier in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: bound_keypair
  bound_keypair:
    recovery:
      mode: standard
      limit: 1
```

Replace `example` in `spec.bot_name` with the name of the bot you created in the
second step.

For this example, we don't need to set any additional options for the bound
keypair token. We've allowed a single recovery attempt, which will be used to
allow the bot's initial join, and Teleport will generate a registration secret
automatically when the token is created as we have not preregistered a public
key to use.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Onboarding Options">
This example makes use of registration secrets to authenticate the initial join.
If desired, it is also possible to generate a key on the bot host first and
register it with Teleport out-of-band, avoiding the need to copy secrets between
hosts.

To learn more about preregistering public keys, see the
[alternative flow](#alternative-preregistered-keys) below. For more information
on Bound Keypair Joining's other onboarding and recovery options, refer to the
[reference page][reference].
</Admonition>

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f token-example.yaml
```

Next, retrieve the generated registration secret, which will be needed for the
next step:
```code
$ tctl get token/example --format=json | jq -r '.[0].status.bound_keypair.registration_secret'
```

This assumes `jq` is installed. If not, run `tctl get token/example` and inspect
the `.status.bound_keypair.registration_secret` field.

## Step 4/5. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the bot host.**

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: bound_keypair
  token: example
  bound_keypair:
    registration_secret: SECRET
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace the following:
- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy.
- `example` with the name of the token created in the previous step, if you
  changed it from `example`.
- `SECRET` with the registration secret retrieved in the previous step.

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/daemon-or-oneshot.mdx!)

## Step 5/5. Configure outputs

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/configure-outputs.mdx!)

## Alternative: preregistered keys

This guide makes use of a registration secret - a single use shared secret
that's consumed on the first bot join and allows a bot to automatically register
its public key with Teleport. If you don't want to use any shared secrets, you
can instead opt to generate the bot's keypair ahead of time and inform Teleport
of the public key yourself.

To generate a public key, run the following command on the bot host:
```code
## If needed, create the bot's storage directory
$ mkdir -p /var/lib/teleport/bot
$ tbot keypair create --storage /var/lib/teleport/bot --proxy-server=example.teleport.sh:443
2025-07-08T16:31:48.000-00:00 INFO [TBOT]      keypair has been written to storage storage:directory: /var/lib/teleport/bot tbot/keypair.go:135

To register the keypair with Teleport, include this public key in the token's
`spec.bound_keypair.onboarding.initial_public_key`:

	ssh-ed25519 <data>
```

Note the SSH-style public key written to the console - you'll need this value in
the next step.

<Admonition type="note" title="Automation note">
Be aware that if a keypair already exists within the specified storage directory
it will not be overwritten by default. If an existing key is found, a warning
will be logged and the existing public key will be printed to the console.

If you explicitly want to create a new public key, pass the `--overwrite` flag
to `tbot keypair create`. A warning will also be logged if any keys are actually
overwritten.

If you'd like to automate this process, the `--format=json` flag will write the
public key string in a JSON document for use in scripts.
</Admonition>

Note that while a proxy server address must be provided, this is only used to
ping the cluster to determine its configured
[signature algorithms](../../../deployment/signature-algorithms.mdx). Once the keypair has been
generated, the public key will be printed to the console.

Next, on your local machine, create a file named `token-example.yaml`:
```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: bound_keypair
  bot_name: example
  bound_keypair:
    onboarding:
      initial_public_key: "ssh-ed25519 <data>"
    recovery:
      mode: standard
      limit: 1
```

The SSH-style public key generated by the bot should be copied into the
`initial_public_key` field. As shown above, the value should be quoted to ensure
the YAML remains valid.

Create the token with `tctl`:
```code
$ tctl create -f token-example.yaml
```

Back on the bot machine, configure the bot as in the original guide, but this
time with no `registration_secret` field set. Create a `tbot.yaml` with this
content:
```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: bound_keypair
  token: example
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

As in the original example, replace:
- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy.
- `example` with the name of the token created in the previous step, if you
  changed it from `example`.

Note that the `storage.path` must point to the same storage directory you passed
to `tbot keypair create` above.

Once the config file has been created, you can start the bot as usual:
```code
$ tbot start -c tbot.yaml
```
