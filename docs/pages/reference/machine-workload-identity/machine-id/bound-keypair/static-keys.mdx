In this guide, you will install Machine and Workload Identity's agent, `tbot`,
on an arbitrary stateless environment using Bound Keypair static keys. This
might be a CI/CD job on a provider not yet supported by one of Teleport's
[dedicated join methods](../../../deployment/join-methods.mdx), an ephemeral
bare-metal node, or any other environment without writable persistent storage.

Bound Keypair Joining is a more flexible alternative to [secret-based join
methods][secret], and static keys allow arbitrary nodes to join by relaxing some
of its built-in security requirements.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Persistent Storage">
If your provider has writable persistent storage, like a Kubernetes PVC or
similar writable persistent storage, you should instead follow the [standard
Bound Keypair guide](./getting-started.mdx).
</Admonition>

## How it works

Bound Keypair joining typically assumes you have access to writable client-side
storage to store additional identity proofs, but this requirement is lifted when
using Bound Keypair static keys.

Normally, the actual Bound Keypair keys are managed internally by the `tbot`
client, which allows them to be generated and rotated on demand. With static
keys, you take direct ownership of the private key and can store it as you see
fit - like in a platform keystore. The `tbot` client is then configured to use
your static private key instead of managing it automatically.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Security Considerations">
Static key joining relaxes certain security checks otherwise performed when
client-side storage is available. This is designed to be used where no other
join methods are possible. Before continuing, consider:
- Using a [dedicated join method](../../../deployment/join-methods.mdx) for your
  platform if available.
- Using [standard Bound Keypair joining](./getting-started.mdx) if your
  environment has writable persistent storage.

[Read more about static keys and what tradeoffs they
require](./concepts.mdx#static-keys) before using them in a production
environment.

## Prerequisites

{/* note: consider edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx include for v19; it is misleading due to the minor launch release */}

{/* TODO: replace version with version containing `tbot keypair create --static` */}

- A running Teleport cluster version 18.2.0 or above.
- The `tsh`, `tctl`, and `tbot` clients.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/7. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the bot host.**

First, `tbot` needs to be installed on the host that you wish to use Machine ID
on.

Download and install the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/7. Create a Bot

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/7. Create a keypair and a join token

Next, we'll need to generate a keypair, consisting of:
* A private key that will need to be available on your bot host at runtime
* A public key that will need to be configured in the Teleport join token

We'll use a helper in the `tbot` client to generate a static keypair. This
step can be run anywhere and does not require any configuration, but you will
need to decide how the bot will access the key, which may vary depending on your
environment or secret store:
1. Via an environment variable, useful for providers or environments that inject
   secrets as environment variables
2. Via a standard file which you transfer to the bot host

With that in mind, if you intend to make the key available to `tbot` via an
environment variable, run the following:

```code
$ tbot keypair create --proxy-server <Var name="example.teleport.sh"/>:443 --static
```

Otherwise, if using a file, run the following:
```code
$ tbot keypair create --proxy-server <Var name="example.teleport.sh"/>:443 --static --static-key-path ./path/to/key
```

Adjust the `--static-key-path` value as desired. If you didn't run this command
on the bot host directly, be prepared to transfer this to the bot host in the
next step.

In either case, the command will generate a keypair and print some instructions.
For example, this is shown when using an environment variable key:
```code
To register the keypair with Teleport, include this public key in the token's
'spec.bound_keypair.onboarding.initial_public_key' field:

	<Var name="public key"/>

Refer to this token example as a reference:

	kind: token
	metadata:
	  name: example-token
	spec:
	  bot_name: example
	  bound_keypair:
	    onboarding:
	      initial_public_key: <Var name="public key"/>
	    recovery:
	      limit: 0
	      mode: insecure
	  join_method: bound_keypair
	  roles:
	  - Bot
	version: v2

Configure your bot to use this static key by inserting the following private key
value into the bot's environment, ideally via a platform-specific keystore if
available:

	export TBOT_BOUND_KEYPAIR_STATIC_KEY="<...encoded private key...>"

Note that bots joined with static tokens do not support keypair rotation and
will be unable to join if a rotation is requested server-side via the token's
'rotate_after' field. Additionally, 'insecure' recovery mode must be used, as
shown above. Read more at:

	https://goteleport.com/docs/reference/machine-workload-identity/machine-id/bound-keypair/concepts/#recovery
```

This command will print the public key, a join token example, and the private
key needed to configure your bot. Keep this output available as you'll need it
through the next step.

Using the example token printedÂ by the above command as a template,
create `token.yaml` containing the following content:
```yaml
kind: token
metadata:
  name: example-token
spec:
  bot_name: example
  bound_keypair:
  onboarding:
    initial_public_key: <Var name="public key"/>
  recovery:
    limit: 0
    mode: insecure
  join_method: bound_keypair
  roles:
  - Bot
version: v2
```

Be sure to set `bot_name` to match the bot created in the previous step, and
ensure the public key matches the value printed by `tbot keypair create ...`.

When ready, create the join token in your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:
```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 4/7. Store the private key

Now that you've generated the private key, it needs to be stored and made
available to your job. Exactly how to do this will depend on your provider and
environment, as well as whether you'll be making it available via an environment
variable or a file.

### Storing the key in a file on the bot host

Ensure the private key file you generated is made available on the bot host. If
you generated it on your local machine, this might mean copying it via `scp`,
provisioning the key via Ansible, or transferring it to the bot host through
whichever means you prefer.

Take care to ensure the resulting file on the bot host will only be readable by
the account that will run the `tbot` process.

### Storing the key in an environment variable

If using an environment variable, depending on your platform and environment,
you'll likely want to store the key in a platform-specific keystore - such that
the environment variable is set on the bot host when it starts - rather than
on the bot host directly.

Regardless of backend, set the variable as follows:
- Name: `TBOT_BOUND_KEYPAIR_STATIC_KEY`
- Value: the base64-encoded value as printed by `tbot keypair create --static ...`

The value is the same content that would otherwise be written to a file if you'd
used `tbot keypair create ... --static --static-key-path /path/to/key`, but the
content has been base64 encoded to simplify use as an environment variable
value.

## Step 5/7. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the bot host.**

### With an environment variable key

If exposing the secret via an environment variable, ensure it's available in the
`$TBOT_BOUND_KEYPAIR_STATIC_KEY` variable.

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: <Var name="example.teleport.sh"/>:443
onboarding:
  join_method: bound_keypair
  token: example-token
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Aside from specifying the `join_method` and `token`, no additional configuration
is needed; the key will be read from the environment as needed during the join
process.

### With a file key

Copy the key to the bot environment or otherwise make sure it's available, and
write the following to `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: <Var name="example.teleport.sh"/>:443
onboarding:
  join_method: bound_keypair
  token: example-token
  bound_keypair:
    static_private_key_path: /path/to/key
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Set `static_private_key_path` to point to the location the key will be
available and save the file.

## Step 6/7. Verify `tbot` can authenticate to Teleport

Run `tbot` using the `tbot.yaml` you created, and ensure the private key is
available as expected, either via file (at the path you configured earlier) or
via the environment in `$TBOT_BOUND_KEYPAIR_STATIC_KEY`:

```code
$ tbot start -c /etc/tbot.yaml --oneshot
```

If everything has been setup correctly, `tbot` should run, authenticate with
Teleport, and exit cleanly. In production, you can remove the `--oneshot` flag
if you want `tbot` to continually provide updated certificates for
longer-running jobs, otherwise the certificates issued will expire eventually
(1 hour by default).
