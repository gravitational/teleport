title: Machine ID v14 Upgrade Guide
description: Upgrade instructions for Machine ID in Teleport 14.0
---

Teleport 14.0 introduces a new version of the configuration format (v2) for
the Machine ID agent, `tbot`. This guide explains the breaking changes present
between the v1 and v2 configuration format and how to migrate.

You do not need to take any action if:

- You do not use Machine ID.
- You configure `tbot` using only the CLI parameters.

## Summary of breaking changes

Previously, the `tbot` configuration contained a list of destinations. A
`destination` described what should be written, where it should be written, and
which credential attributes should be used.

Because each `destination` had a large number of configuration fields, the
fields sometimes combined to produce unusable certificates.

To address this issue and simplify the configuration for Machine ID, Teleport 14
provides a new version of the configuration schema. The field previously known
as a `destination` is now an `output`. Unlike a `destination`, an `output` has
a specific type. The concept of `destination` remains, but now refers to where
artifacts should be read from and written to.

Here is an example of the v1 configuration:

```yaml
destinations:
- directory:
    path: /opt/machine-id
  roles:
  - editor
  app: grafana
```

Here is an example of the v2 configuration:
```yaml
version: v2
outputs:
- type: application
  roles:
  - editor
  destination:
    type: directory
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

See the [configuration reference](configuration.mdx) for details of the new
configuration version and how to define outputs.

## Migrating configuration files

On start, `tbot` will automatically attempt to migrate a v1 configuration to
v2 to continue operating without disruption. This migration is ephemeral and
is not written to disk.

We strongly recommend converting your configuration file from v1 to v2
permanently. `tbot` will emit a warning when it starts until you do so.

Determine the path of your current configuration file and the path you wish to
write the migrated configuration file to. Then run:

```code
$ tbot migrate -c /config.yaml -o /config.migrated.yaml
```

Inspect the migrated configuration file to ensure it meets your expectations,
and try running `tbot` with it. If everything works as expected, replace your
original configuration file with the migrated one.

### Migration failure

If migration fails, review the error logged by the migration command. In most
cases, the error will indicate where a problem was found or why your original
configuration can't be migrated. It might be that your original configuration
contains invalid or conflicting entries and that previous versions of `tbot`
might not have validated for these.

If you are still unable to determine why your configuration will not migrate,
seek guidance. If you have a support contract, submit a ticket. If you are using
