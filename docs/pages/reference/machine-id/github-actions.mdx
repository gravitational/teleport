## Guides

You can read step-by-step guides on using Machine ID and GitHub Actions:

- [Using Machine ID with GitHub Actions](../../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/deployment/github-actions.mdx): How to
  use Machine ID to SSH into Teleport nodes from GitHub Actions.

## GitHub join token

The `token` resource sets out rules for what is allowed to join a Teleport
cluster. Joining clients must specify which `token` they want to use, and then
information included in their join request is compared to the rules contained
within the token by the Auth Server to determine whether or not they should be
admitted.

The following snippet shows all available options in the `token` resource when
used for GitHub joining with Machine ID:
