This page discusses the main concepts needed to understand Bound Keypair
Joining.

## Bound keypair

The term "bound keypair" refers to both the type of credential and way it's used
in Teleport: first, a bot generates a standard public/private keypair; next,
Teleport is configured to trust the public key, binding it to a token.

While bots using Bound Keypair Joining will receive regular, short-lived
Teleport certificates, and will refresh them regularly in a similar manner to
[renewable certificates][renewable], they also make use of an additional
public/private keypair that is not tied directly to a certificate. Critically,
this means the keypair does not have an expiration date, and that any trust
relationship established between Teleport and a Bound Keypair bot is controlled
by server-side configuration within Teleport and not due to the passage of time.

Once this trust relationship has been established, bots can - in a sense - serve
as their own identity authority, similar to how cloud providers can attest to
the identity of a host or CI workflow run. Teleport issues the joining bot a
unique cryptographic challenge which the bot signs using its private key, and
the result is verified using the key registered with Teleport.

As this self attestation is not by itself a sufficient security guarantee, Bound
Keypair Joining makes use of additional server-side rules to control whether or
not a join attempt will be allowed, including:
- Limiting the number of [recovery attempts](#recovery) and optionally requiring
  (server-side) human intervention for each recovery.
- Preventing reuse or theft of private keys using
  [join state verification](#join-state-verification).

## Onboarding

Onboarding takes place at first join and is the stage at which a public key
becomes bound to a token. There are two methods bots may use to complete this
step:
- Preregistered keys: a private key is generated locally on the bot host, and
  the public key is copied out-of-band to Teleport by a human user or a script.
  This method ensures no secret values are ever copied between systems.
- Registration secrets: a one time use random secret is generated by Teleport
  and provided to the bot host via either a human user or a script, similar to
  the [ephemeral `token` join method][token].

If a registration secret is used, the bot uses the registration secret to prove
its identity for this first connection, generates a keypair on the fly, and
registers the public key with Teleport.

Registration secrets are used by default: if a token is created and no initial
(preregistered) public key is provided, a registration secret will be randomly
generated by Teleport and written to the token's
`status.bound_keypair.registration_secret` field.

In both cases - once registered, or when using preregistered keys - the joining
bot is then required to complete a joining challenge. A unique cryptographic
challenge is generated by Teleport which the bot must sign and return. If the
signature matches the registered public key, onboarding has succeeded: the
public key is permanently bound to the token, a certificate bundle is issued,
and a join state document is provided for use on the next join attempt.

## Recovery

Recovery takes place when a bot uses its private key to request new
certificates. This can occur in two situations:
- On first join, when the bot has no certificates.
- When the bot's certificates expire before they can be renewed, such as when a
  bot is offline for longer than its configured `certificate_ttl`.

So long as the bot has and maintains valid Teleport credentials - by default,
bot certificates are valid for an hour and renewed every 20 minutes, but these
values are configurable - no recovery will be needed after the initial join.
Recovery is only required when a bot is unable to refresh its certificates for
longer than its configured certificate TTL (e.g. 1 hour).

The behavior of the recovery process depends on two values configured in the
token resource: the recovery mode (`spec.bound_keypair.recovery.mode`), and the
recovery limit (`spec.bound_keypair.recovery.limit`). The mode may have these
values:
- `standard` (default): only `limit` recovery attempts can be automatically
  attempted.

  This mode is recommended for most situations. Bots can recover automatically
  so long as the recovery count (`status.bound_keypair.recovery_count`) doesn't
  exceed the configured limit, which allows cluster administrators to select
  their tolerance for automatic bot recovery attempts.

  [Join state verification](#join-state-verification) is enabled, which helps
  prevent keypair reuse, but does require clients to store additional on each
  join.

  Note that as the initial join counts as a recovery attempt, `limit` must
  always be at least `1` for the initial join to succeed.

- `relaxed`: `limit` is ignored, but
  [join state verification](#join-state-verification) remains enabled.

  This mode allows for unlimited recovery attempts and is useful for lower
  security impact bots, or deployments where bots are regularly expected to go
  offline for extended periods.

  Like `standard` mode, join state verification is enabled to help prevent
  keypair reuse, but does require clients to store additional state on each
  join.

- `insecure`: `limit` is ignored, and join state verification is **disabled**.

  This mode is the most flexible, as bots can rejoin repeatedly and can operate
  without mutable client-side state. However, this disables most additional
  security checks and should be used with care.
  [See the admin guide](admin-guide.mdx#disabling-join-state-verification) for
  more information on using `insecure` mode in practice.

## Join state verification

A **join state document** is an additional piece of information provided to
joining bots alongside their usual Teleport certificate bundle. It contains
signed information about the state of the joining process, including a sequence
number that uniquely identifies each join attempt.

**Join state verification** both ensures that the bot can provide a valid and
signed join state document, and that the document contains the expected sequence
number.
* If successful, the join attempt can proceed and a new join state document will
  be issued with an incremented sequence counter.
* If the sequence number presented by the client is outdated, the join
  attempt is rejected, and a lock is created to ensure existing clients will be
  denied further access to the Teleport cluster.

This system takes advantage of Teleport's short lived certificates and frequent
bot reauthentication. If an attacker somehow obtains a copy of a bot's keypair
and attempts to use it to retrieve Teleport certificates, they will initially
succeed. However, the original bot will eventually make another authentication
attempt, using its now-outdated join state document. This join attempt with an
outdated document will trigger a lockout and block both the original bot and any
credentials in use by the attacker.

Note that join state verification is disabled when the token's
`spec.bound_keypair.recovery.mode` is set to `insecure`.
