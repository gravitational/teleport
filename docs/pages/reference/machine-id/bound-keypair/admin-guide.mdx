description: "How to deploy and maintain bots in production with Bound Keypair Joining"
---

This guide discusses various tasks users administering bots using Bound Keypair
Joining may need to perform over the lifespan of the bot.

## Allowing additional recovery attempts

When using the `standard` recovery mode, only a configured number of recovery
attempts can be made. If the limit is reached, no further recovery attempts can
be made until the limit is increased.

To increase this limit and allow an expired bot to join again, edit the token
using `tctl edit`:
```code
$ tctl edit token/example-token
```

Find the `spec.bound_keypair.recovery.limit` field and increment the limit by
the desired amount. You are free to select any desired threshold. For example,
consider these use cases:
- If human intervention is desired for each join attempt you can increase this
  value by 1. This single recovery attempt will be immediately consumed, so
  future recoveries will again require human intervention, and may result in
  downtime.

  While this approach makes downtime likely, it does ensure a human verifies the
  state of the bot host on each recovery.

- If you want human intervention for each recovery, but want to avoid downtime,
  you can increase this value by 2. The first attempt will be consumed
  immediately, but the bot will have one recovery attempt for automatic future
  use.

  A human user can periodically audit the recovery count and bot host to ensure
  a recovery attempt is always available and the host is behaving as expected.

- Any larger value will increase the amount of time required between human
  intervention. You can select your tolerance for automatic bot recoveries as
  desired.

Alternatively, if you wish to allow an unlimited number of automatic recovery
attempts, [refer to the entry below](#allowing-unlimited-recovery-attempts) on
the `relaxed` recovery mode.

Note that the recovery limit is always relative to the recovery counter (in the
`status.bound_keypair.recovery_count` field in the token resource). It is valid
to decrease the limit or set it to zero, however doing so may prevent future
bot recovery attempts until the limit is increased again.

Additionally, note that [join state verification](concepts.mdx#join-state-verification)
is still required, and will prevent multiple concurrent uses of the same keypair
and token. In other words, increasing the recovery limit will not allow multiple
clients to join.

## Allowing unlimited recovery attempts

To allow unlimited recovery attempts, the `spec.bound_keypair.recovery.mode`
field should be set to `relaxed`. To do this, use `tctl edit` to edit the token:
```code
$ tctl edit token/example-token
```

Find or create the `spec.bound_keypair.recovery.mode` field and set the value to
`relaxed`. Save the file and quit your editor to update the token.

When the recovery mode is set to `relaxed`, the `limit` field is ignored and the
`status.bound_keypair.recovery_count` field may increase beyond the written
limit. If the mode is later changed back to `standard`, be aware that future
recovery attempts will fail unless the `limit` is increased to accommodate the
current value of `recovery_count`.

Note that when `relaxed` mode is in use,
[join state verification](concepts.mdx#join-state-verification) is still required and will
prevent multiple concurrent uses of the same keypair and token. If your use case
requires this, you can
[disable join state verification](#disabling-join-state-verification), but doing
so does impact the security of the token.

## Requesting a keypair rotation

To request a keypair rotation, set the `.spec.bound_keypair.rotate_after` field
to contain a timestamp. On the next authentication attempt after that timestamp
has elapsed, the bot will automatically rotate its keypair.

To simplify this process, you can use the `tctl bound-keypair rotate` helper:
```code
$ tctl bound-keypair rotate token-name
```

This sets the timestamp to the current time. Note that by default bots only
reauthenticate every 20 minutes, so it may take some time for the request to be
acknowledged. You can monitor the rotation status by watching the token's
`.status.bound_keypair.last_rotated_at` field.

If you want to force an early rotation and have access to the bot host, you can
restart the `tbot` process, or send it a signal with `pkill -usr1 tbot` to
request an early rotation.

Note that the previous 10 keypairs are retained on the client for use in case of
a cluster rollback; refer to the
[cluster rollback](#recovery-after-a-cluster-rollback) section for additional
information.

## Locking a `bound_keypair` bot or bot instance

The simplest way to lock out a bot that joined using the `bound_keypair` join
method is to use a join token lock target:

```code
$ tctl lock --join-token=token-name
```

As a bound keypair token is linked to a single bot, this will effectively lock
the bot. It will not be able to reauthenticate, recover, interact with the
Teleport API, or otherwise use its credentials until the lock is removed.

Note that if a bot is locked for long enough - bots have a 1 hour certificate
TTL by default - its certificates will expire. If you intend to remove this lock
and reinstate the bot, you may also need to increase the recovery limit
(`.spec.bound_keypair.recovery.limit`) to accommodate the additional recovery
attempt.

Other lock targets can also be used, but are not preferred:
- Bot instance (`tctl lock --bot-instance-id ...`): will lock only a single
  instance of the bot. Note that if the recovery limit allows for it, the
  [automatic recovery process](concepts.mdx#recovery) will attempt to rejoin and, if
  successful, will generate a new bot instance ID.
- Bot name (`tctl lock --user bot-<name>`): will lock all bots using the same
  bot / user. This may be overly broad and lock other instances running under
  this bot user.

## Recovering a locked `bound_keypair` bot instance

Bots joined with the `bound_keypair` join method can become automatically locked
under various conditions, including:
- Failing to correctly complete [join state verification](concepts.mdx#join-state-verification)
- Connecting with certificates that have an invalid [generation counter][ephemeral]
- Locked manually by a cluster admin

To recover a bot that has become locked, first ensure the bot's internal storage
(`storage`) has not been compromised. These locking conditions are designed to
trigger if more than one client tries to join using a copy of the same
certificates and private key. This can occur due to a misconfiguration or due
to an attacker copying a bot's credentials, so ideally the latter should be
ruled out before unlocking a bot.

Next, determine the name (UUID) of the lock or locks targeting the bot:
```code
$ tctl get lock
kind: lock
metadata:
  name: 372af058-76d1-4e64-93da-3b04d7d03ac2
spec:
  target:
    user: bot-example
version: v2
---
kind: lock
metadata:
  name: 791d0b1d-01b4-4752-8a99-9b2908aebfae
spec:
  target:
    bot_instance_id: e7d494ae-a0ff-4d12-b935-de5e2025f667
version: v2
---
kind: lock
metadata:
  name: a69fdbb2-8e53-406a-b453-48b2cda6991d
spec:
  target:
    join_token: example-token-name
version: v2
```

Note the different locks and lock targets shown above: bots can be targeted by
any of their Teleport user name (`bot-example`), the bot instance ID (a UUID),
or the join token name. Locks created automatically for bots using Bound Keypair
Joining will typically use a `join_token` target, but a lock targeting any of
these values could be created manually.

Note that locks may have a message field containing details about why the lock
was created.

Once the lock name(s) have been determined, remove each using `tctl rm`:
```code
$ tctl rm lock/372af058-76d1-4e64-93da-3b04d7d03ac2
```

Next, join state should be reset. Use `tctl edit` to set the token's recovery
mode to `insecure`, but make a note of the current value (`standard` or
`relaxed`):
```code
$ tctl edit token/example-token
```

Change the `.spec.bound_keypair.recovery.mode` field to `insecure`, save, and
quit the editor.

The bot can now be allowed to rejoin. Given sufficient time it will retry on its
own, but if you have access to the host, `systemctl restart tbot` or similar can
be used to restart the bot process.

The bot should now be able to join successfully. You can monitor progress by
watching for new audit events in Teleport's web UI, or by waiting for the
recovery counter to increase:
```code
$ tctl get token/example-token --format=json | jq '.[].status.bound_keypair.recovery_count'
```

Once the bot has joined successfully, reset the recovery mode to its previous
value using `tctl edit`:
```code
$ tctl edit token/example-token
```

If you do suspect the bot's credentials may have been compromised, you may also
want to [request a keypair rotation](#requesting-a-keypair-rotation) in
addition to taking other steps to ensure the host is properly secured.

## Disabling join state verification

It is occasionally useful to intentionally disable join state verification. For
example, this can enable use with:
- CI/CD providers without an explicit [delegated join method][delegated].
- Nodes with immutable storage that cannot store an updated join state document
  after each join.

Before continuing, be aware that disabling join state verification will prevent
Teleport from detecting if multiple clients are joining using the same bound
keypair token. In other words, if the private key is copied by an attacker, they
will be able to join indefinitely. Take care to protect the keypair, and make
certain to limit access from the bot identity using Teleport's
[RBAC system][rbac].

When ready, use `tctl edit` to modify the Bound Keypair token:
```code
$ tctl edit token/example-token
```

Find or add the `spec.bound_keypair.recovery.mode` field and set it to
`insecure`. Save and quit your editor to update the token.

With the mode set to `insecure`, the `recovery.limit` is ignored, allowing
unlimited reuse of the token, and join state verification is disabled, allowing
concurrent or stateless reuse.

## Recovery after a cluster rollback

If your Teleport cluster is rolled back for any reason, joining bots may fail
[join state verification](concepts.mdx#join-state-verification) as their local join state
document may not match the values currently (or previously) known to Teleport.

The simplest workaround is to temporarily set all bound keypair tokens to
`insecure` recovery mode for the first join attempt following a cluster restore.
Once they've joined once, they will once again have a valid join state, so the
recovery mode can be restored to its previous value.

To change the recovery mode, use `tctl edit` to modify the token resource:
```code
$ tctl edit token/example-token
```

Find the `spec.bound_keypair.recovery.mode` field, and set the value to
"insecure". Repeat this for each bound keypair token. Wait for all bound keypair
bots to reauthenticate, and repeat this process to restore the recovery mode to
its previous value.

If [bot keypairs were rotated](#requesting-a-keypair-rotation) between the
snapshot and restore of the Teleport cluster, note that bots only keep a record
of the previous 10 keypairs. This means server-side recovery may impossible if
the keypair expected by the restored Teleport cluster has been rotated out of
the client-side history, or if the client-side history has been lost or deleted.
