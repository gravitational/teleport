  use Machine ID to SSH into Teleport nodes from GitLab CI.

## GitLab join token

A GitLab join token contains allow rules that describe which pipelines can
use that token in order to join the Teleport cluster. A rule can contain
multiple fields, and any pipeline that matches all of the fields within a
single rule is granted access.
