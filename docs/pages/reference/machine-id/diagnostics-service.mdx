title: Diagnostics Service
description: Reference information for the `tbot` diagnostics service.
---

The `tbot` process can optionally expose a diagnostics service. This is
disabled by default, but once enabled, allows useful information about the
running `tbot` process to be queried via HTTP.

## Configuration

To enable the diagnostics service, you must specify an address and port for
it to listen on.

For security reasons, you should ensure that access to this listener is
restricted. In most cases, the most secure thing to do is to bind the listener
to `127.0.0.1`, which will only allow access from the local machine.

You can configure the diagnostics service using the `--diag-addr` CLI parameter:

```code
$ tbot start -c my-config.yaml --diag-addr 127.0.0.1:3001
```

Or directly within the configuration file using `diag_addr`:

```yaml
diag_addr: 127.0.0.1:3001
```

## Endpoints

The diagnostics service exposes the following HTTP endpoints.

### `/livez`

The `/livez` endpoint always returns with a 200 status code. This can be used
to determine if the `tbot` process is running and has not crashed or hung.

If deploying to Kubernetes, we recommend this endpoint is used for your
Liveness Probe.

### `/readyz`

The `/readyz` endpoint currently returns the same information as `/livez`.

In the future, this endpoint will be expanded to indicate whether the internal
components of `tbot` have been able to generate certificates and are ready
to serve requests.

### `/metrics`

The `/metrics` endpoint returns a Prometheus-compatible metrics snapshot.

The metrics provided by the Go runtime are exposed and these can be used for
monitoring the overall health of the `tbot` process. In addition, certain
outputs and services configured in `tbot` will produce metrics.

#### `ssh-multiplexer`

The SSH multiplexer service exposes metrics about the number of active SSH
connections:

- `tbot_ssh_multiplexer_requests_started_total`: the total number of SSH
   connections that have been started.
- `tbot_ssh_multiplexer_requests_handled_total`: the total number of SSH
   connections that have been handled. This has a `status` label with the
   following values: `OK` or `ERROR`.
- `tbot_ssh_multiplexer_requests_in_flight`: the number of SSH connections
   currently in progress.

### `/debug/pprof`

These endpoints allow the collection of pprof profiles for debugging purposes.
You may be asked by a Teleport engineer to collect these if you are experiencing
performance issues.

They will only be enabled if the `-d`/`--debug` flag is provided when starting
`tbot`. This is known as **debug mode**.
