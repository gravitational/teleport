The guides in this section list fields within dynamic resources you can manage
with Teleport. For more information on dynamic resources, see our guide to
[Using Dynamic
Resources](../../../zero-trust-access/infrastructure-as-code/infrastructure-as-code.mdx).

Examples of applying dynamic resources with `tctl`:

```code
# List all connectors:
$ tctl get connectors

# Dump a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl get saml/okta

# Delete a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl rm saml/okta

# Delete an OIDC connector called "gworkspace":
$ tctl rm oidc/gworkspace

# Delete a github connector called "myteam":
$ tctl rm github/myteam

# Delete a local user called "admin":
$ tctl rm users/admin

# Show all devices:
$ tctl get devices

# Fetch a specific device:
$ tctl get devices/<asset-tag>

# Fetch the cluster auth preferences
$ tctl get cluster_auth_preference
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Although `tctl get connectors` will show you every connector, when working with an individual connector you must use the correct `kind`, such as `saml` or `oidc`. You can see each connector's `kind` at the top of its YAML output from `tctl get connectors`.
</Admonition>

Here's the list of resources currently exposed via [`tctl`](../../cli/tctl.mdx):

| Resource Kind | Description |
| - | - |
| [user](user.mdx) | A user record in the internal Teleport user DB. |
| [role](role.mdx) | A role assumed by interactive and non-interactive users. |
| connector | Authentication connectors for [Single Sign-On](../../../zero-trust-access/sso/sso.mdx) (SSO) for SAML, OIDC and GitHub. |
| node | A registered SSH node. The same record is displayed via `tctl nodes ls`. |
| windows_desktop | A registered Windows desktop. |
| cluster | A trusted cluster. See [here](../../../zero-trust-access/management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) for more details on connecting clusters together. |
| [login_rule](login-rules.mdx) | A Login Rule, see the [Login Rules guide](../../../zero-trust-access/authentication/login-rules/login-rules.mdx) for more info. |
| [device](device.mdx) | A Teleport Trusted Device, see the [Device Trust guide](../../../identity-governance/device-trust/guide.mdx) for more info. |
| [ui_config](ui-config.mdx) | Configuration for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service. |
| [vnet_config](vnet-config.mdx) | Configuration for the cluster's VNet options. |
| [cluster_auth_preference](cluster-auth-preferences.mdx) | Configuration for the cluster's auth preferences. |
| [database_object_import_rule](database-object-import-rule.mdx) | Database object import rules. |
| [autoupdate_config](auto-update-config.mdx) | Client tools auto-update configuration |
| [autoupdate_version](auto-update-version.mdx) | Client tools auto-update target version configuration |
| [access_monitoring_rule](access-monitoring-rule.mdx) | Access monitoring rules. |
| [health_check_config](health-check-config.mdx) | Configuration for resource endpoint health checks |
| [inference_model](inference-model.mdx) | Session summarization AI model configuration |
| [inference_secret](inference-secret.mdx) | Session summarization AI provider secret (API key) |
| [inference_policy](inference-policy.mdx)| Matches sessions to inference models using session kind and other metadata |
