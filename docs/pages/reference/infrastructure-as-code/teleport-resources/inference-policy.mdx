description: Provides a comprehensive list of fields for the Teleport inference policy resource.
---

The inference policy resource controls, in session recording summaries, which
sessions are summarized and which model will be used to summarize them. There
can be multiple policies defined; multiple policies can also share the same
model.

```yaml
kind: inference_policy
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-policy
spec:

  # kinds indicate which kinds of sessions will match this policy. Required.
  # Supported values: 'ssh', 'k8s', 'db'.
  kinds: ['ssh', 'db']

  # model is the name of the inference_model resource containing provider and
  # model configuration. Required.
  model: example-model
  
  # filter is an additional filter that the sessions need to match to be
  # matched by this policy. Optional, defaults to matching all sessions of
  # given kind.
  filter: 'equals(resource.metadata.labels["env"], "prod")'
```

See [Predicate Language](../../access-controls/predicate-language.mdx) for more details on the
filter expressions.
