In most cases, Teleport will register `windows_desktop` resources automatically
based on static hosts in your configuration file or via LDAP-based discovery.

You can also use [dynamic
registration](../../../enroll-resources/desktop-access/dynamic-registration.mdx) using
`dynamic_windows_desktop` resources. This can be useful for managing inventories
of hosts that are not joined to an Active Directory domain.

There are a few important considerations to keep in mind when registering
desktops this way:

1. The desktop's `addr` can be a hostname or IP address, and should include
   the RDP port (typically 3389).
1. If you intend to log in to the desktop with local Windows users you must set
   `non_ad: true`. If you intend to log in with Active Directory users, leave
   `non_ad` unset (or false), and specify the Active Directory domain in the
   `domain` field.
