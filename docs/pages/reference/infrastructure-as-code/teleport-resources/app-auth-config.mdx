The app auth configuration enables cluster administrators to set up various
authentication methods for app access.

```yaml
kind: app_auth_config
version: v1
spec:
  # app_labels define the labels matcher for applications that can use this authentication config.
  #
  # In this example, it will match all MCP applications.
  app_labels:
    teleport.internal/app-sub-kind: mcp
  # jwt contains the JWT spec.
  jwt:
    # issuer is the JWT token issuer name. This value is used to verify the
    # token.
    issuer: custom-realm
    # audience is expected audience from the generated token.
    # This value will usually be a client_id.
    audience: teleport
    # username_claim (optional) is the claim name used as username. Defaults to `email`.
    username_claim: preferred_username
    # authorization_header (optional) defines the header name that will contain
    # the token. Defaults to `Authorization`.
    authorization_header: JWT-Authorization
    # jwks_url is the JWKS URL address used to fetch signing keys.
    #
    # Only required, when static_jwks is not set.
    jwks_url: https://keycloak-addr/realms/custom-realm/.well-known/jwks
    # static_jwks (optional) allows the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) used to verify the
    # token to be set, removing the necessity of Teleport to retrieve it from the
    # issuer.
    #
    # When unspecified, the JWKS will be fetched automatically.
    static_jwks: |
     {"keys":[--snip--]}
