title: Inference Secret Resource Reference
sidebar_label: Inference Secret
description: Provides a comprehensive list of fields for the Teleport inference secret resource.
---

The inference secret resource configures a secret, such as OpenAI API key or
LiteLLM master key, that is used along with an `inference_model`. Multiple
inference models can use the same secret. Inference secret resources can be
listed and retrieved, but their values will be stripped from the payload to
protect them from leaking outside.

```yaml
kind: inference_secret
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-openai-key
spec:
  # value is the secret value, e.g. an OpenAI key.
  value: "************************************"
```
