**Kind**: `discovery_config`<br/>
**Version**: `v1`

Describes extra discovery matchers that are added to DiscoveryServices that share the same Discovery Group.

Example definition:
```yaml
kind: discovery_config
version: v1
metadata:
  name: my-discovery-config
spec:
  # discovery_group is used to group discovered resources into different
  # sets. This is required when you have multiple Teleport Discovery services
  # running. It prevents discovered services from colliding in Teleport when
  # managing discovered resources.
  # If two Discovery Services match the same resources, they must be in the
  # same discovery group.
  # If two Discovery Services match different resources, they must be in
  # different discovery groups.
  #
  # It is also used to watch DiscoveryConfig resources.
  # The Discovery Configs that have a matching discovery_group will be added to
  # this Discovery Service matchers.
  discovery_group: "disc-group"
  # Matchers for discovering AWS-hosted resources.
