sidebar_label: Auto-Update Version
description: Provides a comprehensive list of fields for the Teleport auto-update version resource.

The auto-update version resource allows cluster administrators to manage
versions used for agent and client tools Managed Updates.

<Admonition type="warning">
The `autoupdate_config` and `autoupdate_version` resources configure Managed
Updates v2 and Managed Updates v1.

`cluster_maintenance_config` above configures only Managed Updates v1
which are currently supported but will be deprecated in a future version.
</Admonition>

This resource is not editable for cloud-managed Teleport Enterprise to ensure that all of
your clients receive security patches and remain compatible with your cluster.

See [Teleport Client Tool Managed Updates](../../../upgrading/client-tools-managed-updates.mdx) and
[Teleport Agent Managed Updates](../../../upgrading/agent-managed-updates/agent-managed-updates.mdx) for more details.
