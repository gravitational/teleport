## Schema

### Required

- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is an AccessMonitoringRule specification (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-spec))
- `version` (String) version is version

### Optional

- `metadata` (Attributes) metadata is the rules's metadata. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-metadata))
- `sub_kind` (String) sub_kind is an optional resource sub kind, used in some resources

### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `subjects` (List of String) subjects the rule operates on, can be a resource kind or a particular resource property.

Optional:

- `automatic_review` (Attributes) automatic_review defines automatic review configurations for Access Requests. Both notification and automatic_review may be set within the same access_monitoring_rule. If both fields are set, the rule will trigger both notifications and automatic reviews for the same set of access events. Separate plugins may be used if both notifications and automatic_reviews is set. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specautomatic_review))
- `condition` (String) condition is a predicate expression that operates on the specified subject resources, and determines whether the subject will be moved into desired state.
- `desired_state` (String) desired_state defines the desired state of the subject. For Access Request subjects, the desired_state may be set to `reviewed` to indicate that the Access Request should be automatically reviewed.
- `notification` (Attributes) notification defines the plugin configuration for notifications if rule is triggered. Both notification and automatic_review may be set within the same access_monitoring_rule. If both fields are set, the rule will trigger both notifications and automatic reviews for the same set of access events. Separate plugins may be used if both notifications and automatic_reviews is set. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specnotification))
- `schedules` (Attributes Map) schedules specifies a map of schedules that can be used to configure the access monitoring rule conditions. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specschedules))
- `states` (List of String) states are the desired state which the monitoring rule is attempting to bring the subjects matching the condition to.

### Nested Schema for `spec.automatic_review`

Optional:

- `decision` (String) decision specifies the proposed state of the access review. This can be either 'APPROVED' or 'DENIED'.
- `integration` (String) integration is the name of the integration that is responsible for monitoring the rule. Set this value to `builtin` to monitor the rule with Teleport.


### Nested Schema for `spec.notification`

Optional:

- `name` (String) name is the name of the plugin to which this configuration should apply.
- `recipients` (List of String) recipients is the list of recipients the plugin should notify.


### Nested Schema for `spec.schedules`

Optional:

- `time` (Attributes) TimeSchedule specifies an in-line schedule. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specschedulestime))

### Nested Schema for `spec.schedules.time`

Optional:

- `shifts` (Attributes List) Shifts contains a set of shifts that make up the schedule. Shifts are configured in UTC. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-specschedulestimeshifts))

### Nested Schema for `spec.schedules.time.shifts`

Optional:

- `end` (String) End specifies the end time in the format HH:MM, e.g., "12:30".
- `start` (String) Start specifies the start time in the format HH:MM, e.g., "12:30".
