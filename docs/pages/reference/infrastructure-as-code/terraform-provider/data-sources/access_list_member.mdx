### Nested Schema for `header`

Required:

- `version` (String) Version is the API version used to create the resource. It must be specified. Based on this version, Teleport will apply different defaults on resource creation or deletion. It must be an integer prefixed by "v". For example: `v1`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) kind is a resource kind.
- `metadata` (Attributes) metadata is resource metadata. (see [below for nested schema](#nested-schema-for-headermetadata))

### Nested Schema for `header.metadata`

- `expires` (String) expires is a global expiry time header can be set on any resource in the system.

- `revision` (String) revision is an opaque identifier which tracks the versions of a resource over time. Clients should ignore and not alter its value but must return the revision in any updates of a resource.



### Nested Schema for `spec`

Required:

- `access_list` (String) associated Access List
- `membership_kind` (Number) membership_kind describes the type of membership, either `MEMBERSHIP_KIND_USER` or `MEMBERSHIP_KIND_LIST`.
