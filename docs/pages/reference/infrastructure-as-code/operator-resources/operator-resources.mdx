The Teleport Kubernetes operator allows cluster administrators to manage dynamic
resources as Kubernetes resources using `kubectl` or a continuous deployment
tool like Argo CD. The guides in this section of the documentation include
comprehensive lists of fields for each supported resource.

## Getting started with the Kubernetes operator

If you are getting started with the Teleport Kubernetes operator, we recommend
reading the [introductory
guide](../../../zero-trust-access/infrastructure-as-code/teleport-operator/teleport-operator.mdx)
to setting up and using the operator. 

For guidance on using the Teleport Kubernetes operator to manage the dynamic
resources that you would typically see in a Teleport cluster, such as roles and
users, see [Managing
Resources](../../../zero-trust-access/infrastructure-as-code/managing-resources/managing-resources.mdx).

## Selecting a reference guide

The Kubernetes operator resource reference guides are organized by resource
version. Select a resource version from the sidebar to view supported fields.
