## Introduction

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

A Teleport administrator has two tools to configure a Teleport cluster:

- The [configuration file](./config.mdx) is used for static configuration
  settings such as the cluster name.
- The [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) admin tool is used for configuring the Teleport
  Auth Service, and can be used to manage dynamic records like Teleport users.

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">

A Teleport administrator can configure a Teleport cluster by using the
[`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) admin tool to manage dynamic records like Teleport
users.

### `tctl` concepts

[`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) has convenient sub-commands for dynamic
configuration, such as `tctl users` or `tctl nodes`.

For more advanced management tasks, like connecting clusters together or
troubleshooting trust, [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) offers the more powerful,
lower-level CLI interface called `resources`.

The concept is borrowed from the REST programming pattern. A cluster is composed
of different objects (i.e., resources) and there are three common operations
that can be performed on them: `get` , `create` , and `remove` .

A resource is defined as a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file.
Every resource in Teleport has three required fields:

- `kind`: The type of resource
- `name`: A required field in the `metadata` to uniquely identify the resource
- `version`: The version of the resource format

Everything else is resource specific and any component of a Teleport cluster can
be manipulated with just three CLI commands:

| Command | Description | Examples |
| - | - | - |
| [`tctl get`](./cli.mdx#tctl-get) | Get one or multiple resources. | `tctl get users` or `tctl get user/joe` |
| [`tctl rm`](./cli.mdx#tctl-rm) | Delete a resource by type/name. | `tctl rm user/joe` |
| [`tctl create`](./cli.mdx#tctl-create) | Create a new resource from a YAML file. Use the `-f` flag to update existing resources. | `tctl create -f joe.yaml` |

<Admonition

  title="YAML Format"

  By default, Teleport uses [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) to
  describe resources. YAML is a human-readable alternative to JSON or XML, but
  it's sensitive to white space. Pay attention to spaces versus tabs.

</Admonition>

### `tctl` example

Here's an example of a YAML resource definition for a user named `joe`. It can
be retrieved by executing `tctl get user/joe`.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  roles: admin
  status:
    # Users can be temporarily locked in a Teleport system, but this
    # functionality is reserved for internal use for now.
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  traits:
    # These are "allowed logins" which are usually specified as the
    # last argument to `tctl users add`.
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # Any resource in Teleport can automatically expire.
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # For internal use only
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

  Some of the fields you will see when printing resources are used only internally and are not meant to be changed. Others are reserved for future use.

## Dynamic resources

Here's the list of resources currently exposed via [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl):

| Resource Kind | Description |
| - | - |
| [user](#user) | A user record in the internal Teleport user DB. |
| [role](#role) | A role assumed by interactive and non-interactive users. |
| connector | Authentication connectors for [Single Sign-On](../access-controls/sso.mdx) (SSO) for SAML, OIDC and GitHub. |
| node | A registered SSH node. The same record is displayed via `tctl nodes ls` |
| cluster | A trusted cluster. See [here](../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) for more details on connecting clusters together. |
| login_rule | A Login Rule, see the [Login Rules guide](../access-controls/login-rules.mdx) for more info. |
| device | A Teleport Trusted Device, see the [Device Trust guide](../access-controls/device-trust/guide.mdx) for more info. |
| [ui_config](#ui-config) | Configuration for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service |

**Examples:**

```code
# List all connectors:
$ tctl get connectors

# Dump a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl get saml/okta

# Delete a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl rm saml/okta

# Delete an OIDC connector called "gworkspace":
$ tctl rm oidc/gworkspace

# Delete a github connector called "myteam":
$ tctl rm github/myteam

# Delete a local user called "admin":
$ tctl rm users/admin

# Show all devices:
$ tctl get devices

# Fetch a specific device:
$ tctl get devices/<asset-tag>
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Although `tctl get connectors` will show you every connector, when working with an individual connector you must use the correct `kind`, such as `saml` or `oidc`. You can see each connector's `kind` at the top of its YAML output from `tctl get connectors`.

### User

Teleport supports interactive local users, non-interactive local users (bots)
and single-sign on users that are represented as a resource.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles assigned to this user
  roles:
  - admin
  # status sets user temporarily locked in a Teleport system, for example
  # when users exceed predefined amount of failed login attempts
  status:
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # traits are key, list of values pairs assigned to a user resource.
  # Traits can be used in role templates as variables.
  traits:
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # expires, if not empty, sets automatic expiry of the resource
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # created_by is a system property that tracks
  # identity of the author of this user resource.
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

### Role

Interactive and non-interactive users (bots) assume one or many roles.

Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, web services and applications and Windows Desktops.

(!docs/pages/includes/role-spec.mdx!)

### Login Rules

Login rules contain logic to transform SSO user traits during login.

(!docs/pages/includes/login-rule-spec.mdx!)

### Device

Device contains information identifying a trusted device.

(!docs/pages/includes/device-spec.mdx!)

### UI config

Global configuration options for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service. This resource is not set by default, which means a `tctl get ui` will result in an error if used before this resource has been set.

(!docs/pages/includes/ui-config-spec.mdx!)
