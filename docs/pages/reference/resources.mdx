This reference guide lists dynamic resources you can manage with Teleport. For
more information on dynamic resources, see our guide to [Using Dynamic
Resources](../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code.mdx).

Examples of applying dynamic resources with `tctl`:

```code
# List all connectors:
$ tctl get connectors

# Dump a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl get saml/okta

# Delete a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl rm saml/okta

# Delete an OIDC connector called "gworkspace":
$ tctl rm oidc/gworkspace

# Delete a github connector called "myteam":
$ tctl rm github/myteam

# Delete a local user called "admin":
$ tctl rm users/admin

# Show all devices:
$ tctl get devices

# Fetch a specific device:
$ tctl get devices/<asset-tag>

# Fetch the cluster auth preferences
$ tctl get cluster_auth_preference
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Although `tctl get connectors` will show you every connector, when working with an individual connector you must use the correct `kind`, such as `saml` or `oidc`. You can see each connector's `kind` at the top of its YAML output from `tctl get connectors`.
</Admonition>

## List of dynamic resources

Here's the list of resources currently exposed via [`tctl`](./cli/tctl.mdx):

| Resource Kind | Description |
| - | - |
| [user](#user) | A user record in the internal Teleport user DB. |
| [role](#role) | A role assumed by interactive and non-interactive users. |
| connector | Authentication connectors for [Single Sign-On](../admin-guides/access-controls/sso.mdx) (SSO) for SAML, OIDC and GitHub. |
| node | A registered SSH node. The same record is displayed via `tctl nodes ls`. |
| windows_desktop | A registered Windows desktop. |
| cluster | A trusted cluster. See [here](../admin-guides/management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) for more details on connecting clusters together. |
| [login_rule](#login-rules) | A Login Rule, see the [Login Rules guide](../admin-guides/access-controls/login-rules.mdx) for more info. |
| [device](#device) | A Teleport Trusted Device, see the [Device Trust guide](../admin-guides/access-controls/device-trust/guide.mdx) for more info. |
| [ui_config](#ui-config) | Configuration for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service. |
| [vnet_config](#vnet-config) | Configuration for the cluster's VNet options. |
| [cluster_auth_preference](#cluster-auth-preferences) | Configuration for the cluster's auth preferences. |
| [database_object_import_rule](#database-object-import-rule) | Database object import rules. |

## User

Teleport supports interactive local users, non-interactive local users (bots)
and single-sign on users that are represented as a resource.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles assigned to this user
  roles:
  - admin
  # status sets user temporarily locked in a Teleport system, for example
  # when users exceed predefined amount of failed login attempts
  status:
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # traits are key, list of values pairs assigned to a user resource.
  # Traits can be used in role templates as variables.
  traits:
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # expires, if not empty, sets automatic expiry of the resource
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # created_by is a system property that tracks
  # identity of the author of this user resource.
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

## Role

Interactive and non-interactive users (bots) assume one or many roles.

Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, web services and applications and Windows Desktops.

(!docs/pages/includes/role-spec.mdx!)

### Role versions

Versions 5, 6 and 7 of the Teleport role resource have different behaviors when
accessing Kubernetes resources.
{/*lint ignore messaging*/}
Roles not [granting Kubernetes access](../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx) are
equivalent in the three versions.

Roles v5 and v6 can only restrict actions on pods (e.g. executing in them).
Role v7 supports restricting all common resource kinds (
see [the `kubernetes_resource` documentation](../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx#kubernetes_resources)
for a complete list).

When no `kubernetes_resource` is set:
- Roles v5 and v7 grant all access by default
- Roles v6 blocks pod execution by default, this was reverted by roles v7 to improve the user experience.

## Windows desktop

In most cases, Teleport will register `windows_desktop` resources automatically
based on static hosts in your configuration file or via LDAP-based discovery.

However, you can also manage `windows_desktop` resources manually with `tctl`.
This can be useful for managing inventories of hosts that are not joined to
an Active Directory domain.

There are a few important considerations to keep in mind when registering
desktops this way:

1. The desktop's `addr` can be a hostname or IP address, and should include
   the RDP port (typically 3389).
1. The desktop's `host_id` should be set to the name of a
   `windows_desktop_service` that is capable of proxying remote desktop
   connections to the host. If you have multiple such services, you can create
   multiple `windows_desktop` resources with different `host_id` values.
1. If you intend to log in to the desktop with local Windows users you must set
   `non_ad: true`. If you intend to log in with Active Directory users, leave
   `non_ad` unset (or false), and specify the Active Directory domain in the
   `domain` field.

```yaml
kind: windows_desktop
metadata:
  name: desktop-without-ad
  labels:
    foo: bar
    baz: quux
spec:
  host_id: 307e091b-7f6b-42e0-b78d-3362ad10b55d
  addr: 192.168.1.153:3389
  domain: ""
  non_ad: true

  # Optional - ensures that all sessions use the same screen size,
  # no matter what the size of the browser window is.
  # Leave blank to use the size of the browser window.
  screen_size:
    width: 1024
    height: 768
version: v3
```

## Login Rules

Login rules contain logic to transform SSO user traits during login.

(!docs/pages/includes/login-rule-spec.mdx!)

## Database object import rule

Database object import rule define the labels to be applied to database objects imported into Teleport. 

See [Database Access Controls](../enroll-resources/database-access/rbac.mdx) for more details.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/database-object-import-rule-spec.mdx!)

## Device

Device contains information identifying a trusted device.

(!docs/pages/includes/device-spec.mdx!)

## UI config

Global configuration options for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service. This resource is not set by default, which means a `tctl get ui` will result in an error if used before this resource has been set.

(!docs/pages/includes/ui-config-spec.mdx!)

## VNet config

Cluster-specific options VNet should use when setting up connections to resources from this cluster.

See [VNet](../enroll-resources/application-access/guides/vnet.mdx) for more details.

```yaml
kind: vnet_config
version: v1
metadata:
  name: vnet-config
spec:
  # The range to use when assigning IP addresses to resources.
  # It can be changed in case of conflicts with other software
  # deployed on end user devices. Defaults to "100.64.0.0/10".
  ipv4_cidr_range: "100.64.0.0/10"
  # Extra DNS zones that VNet should capture DNS queries for.
  # Set them if your TCP apps use custom public_addr.
  # Requires DNS TXT record to be set on the domains,
  # see the guide linked above. Empty by default.
  custom_dns_zones:
  - suffix: company.test
```

## Cluster maintenance config

Global configuration options for the agents enrolled into automatic updates.

(!docs/pages/includes/cluster-maintenance-config-spec.mdx!)

## Cluster auth preferences

Global cluster configuration options for authentication.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  # Sets the type of second factor to use.
  # Possible values: "on", "otp" and "webauthn"
  # If "on" is set, all MFA protocols are supported.
  second_factor: "otp"

  # The name of the OIDC or SAML connector. if this is not set, the first connector in the backend is used.
  connector_name: ""

  # webauthn is the settings for server-side Web authentication support.
  webauthn:
    # rp_id is the ID of the Relying Party.
    # It should be set to the domain name of the Teleport installation.
    #
    # IMPORTANT: rp_id must never change in the lifetime of the cluster, because
    # it's recorded in the registration data on the WebAuthn device. If the
    # ri_id changes, all existing WebAuthn key registrations will become invalid
    # and all users who use WebAuthn as the second factor will need to
    # re-register.
    rp_id: teleport.example.com
    # Allow list of device attestation CAs in PEM format.
    # If present, only devices whose attestation certificates match the
    # certificates specified here may be registered (existing registrations are
    # unchanged).
    # If supplied in conjunction with `attestation_denied_cas`, then both
    # conditions need to be true for registration to be allowed (the device
    # MUST match an allowed CA and MUST NOT match a denied CA).
    # By default all devices are allowed.
    attestation_allowed_cas: []
    # Deny list of device attestation CAs in PEM format.
    # If present, only devices whose attestation certificates don't match the
    # certificates specified here may be registered (existing registrations are
    # unchanged).
    attestation_denied_cas: []

  # Enforce per-session MFA or PIV-hardware key restrictions on user login sessions.
  # Possible values: true, false, "hardware_key", "hardware_key_touch".
  # Defaults to false.
  require_session_mfa: false

  # Sets whether connections with expired client certificates will be disconnected.
  disconnect_expired_cert: false

  # Sets whether headless authentication is allowed.
  # Headless authentication requires WebAuthn.
  # Defaults to true if webauthn is configured.
  allow_headless: false

  # Sets whether local auth is enabled alongside any other authentication
  # type.
  allow_local_auth: true

  # Sets whether passwordless authentication is allowed.
  # Requires Webauthn to work.
  allow_passwordless: false

  # Sets the message of the day for the cluster.
  message_of_the_day: ""

  # idp is a set of options related to accessing IdPs within Teleport. Requires Teleport Enterprise
  idp:
    # options related to the Teleport SAML IdP.
    saml:
      # enables access to the Teleport SAML IdP.
      enabled: true

  # locking_mode is the cluster-wide locking mode default.
  # Possible values: "strict" or "best_effort"
  locking_mode: best_effort

  # default_session_ttl defines the default TTL (time to live) of certificates
  # issued to the users on this cluster.
  default_session_ttl: "12h"

  # The type of authentication to use for this cluster.
  # Possible values: "local", "oidc", "saml" and "github"
  type: local

version: v2
```

## Bot

Bot resources define a Machine ID Bot identity and its access.

Find out more on the
[Machine ID configuration reference](machine-id/configuration.mdx).
