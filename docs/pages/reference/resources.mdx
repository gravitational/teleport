title: Teleport Configuration Resource Reference
description: The detailed reference documentation for Teleport Configuration Resources
---

This reference guide lists dynamic configuration resources you can manage with
Teleport. For more information on dynamic configuration resources, see our guide
to [Using Dynamic Configuration
Resources](../management/dynamic-configuration.mdx).

Examples of applying dynamic configuration resources with `tctl`:

```code
# List all connectors:
$ tctl get connectors

# Dump a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl get saml/okta

# Delete a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl rm saml/okta

# Delete an OIDC connector called "gworkspace":
$ tctl rm oidc/gworkspace

# Delete a github connector called "myteam":
$ tctl rm github/myteam

# Delete a local user called "admin":
$ tctl rm users/admin

# Show all devices:
$ tctl get devices

# Fetch a specific device:
$ tctl get devices/<asset-tag>
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Although `tctl get connectors` will show you every connector, when working with an individual connector you must use the correct `kind`, such as `saml` or `oidc`. You can see each connector's `kind` at the top of its YAML output from `tctl get connectors`.

## User

Teleport supports interactive local users, non-interactive local users (bots)
and single-sign on users that are represented as a resource.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles assigned to this user
  roles:
  - admin
  # status sets user temporarily locked in a Teleport system, for example
  # when users exceed predefined amount of failed login attempts
  status:
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # traits are key, list of values pairs assigned to a user resource.
  # Traits can be used in role templates as variables.
  traits:
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # expires, if not empty, sets automatic expiry of the resource
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # created_by is a system property that tracks
  # identity of the author of this user resource.
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

## Role

Interactive and non-interactive users (bots) assume one or many roles.

Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, web services and applications and Windows Desktops.

(!docs/pages/includes/role-spec.mdx!)

## Login Rules

Login rules contain logic to transform SSO user traits during login.

(!docs/pages/includes/login-rule-spec.mdx!)

## Device

Device contains information identifying a trusted device.

(!docs/pages/includes/device-spec.mdx!)

## UI config

Global configuration options for the Web UI served by the Proxy Service. This resource is not set by default, which means a `tctl get ui` will result in an error if used before this resource has been set.

(!docs/pages/includes/ui-config-spec.mdx!)

### Cluster Maintenance Config

Global configuration options for the agents enrolled into automatic updates.

(!docs/pages/includes/cluster-maintenance-config-spec.mdx!)
