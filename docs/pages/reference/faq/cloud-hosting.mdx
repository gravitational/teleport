## Billing and usage

### How does Cloud Billing work?

Please [reach out to sales](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise) to discuss pricing.

### Can a customer deploy multiple clusters in Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

[Reach out to sales](https://goteleport.com/signup/enterprise) to discuss pricing.

### If I start with Teleport Enterprise Cloud, can I move to Teleport Enterprise or Teleport Community Edition, or do I need to start again?

If you plan to use S3 and DynamoDB as storage backends, we can provide data for you to import. But you should reach out to us first. If you use a different backend, you will need to start over.

## Security

### How long will Teleport Enterprise Cloud retain my data?

See our documentation on [data retention](./architecture.mdx#data-retention).

### Is an independent security audit available?

Security audits by independent third-parties are performed at least annually. You can request audit results and other
related information on the [Teleport Trust Portal](https://trust.goteleport.com).

### Does your SOC 2 report include Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

### How do you store passwords?

Password hashes are generated using [bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).

### Do you encrypt data at rest?

Each deployment is using at-rest encryption using AWS DynamoDB and S3 at-rest encryption
for customer data including session recordings and user records.

### Can I get a list of IP addresses to configure a firewall?

We do not have plans to offer a list of IP addresses for Teleport Enterprise
Cloud at the moment.

Teleport Enterprise Cloud infrastructure is elastic and IP addresses can and do
change when we make infrastructure changes. This would make the maintenance of
IP allowlists a cumbersome and brittle process for customers.

However, we do provide customers with a stable tenant DNS name backed with
TLS certificates from [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org) that can be
utilized to verify the integrity of any outbound connections to Teleport
Enterprise Cloud.

### Can I configure an allowlist of inbound IP addresses to Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

We do not have plans to offer support for inbound connection IP allowlists.

We believe mTLS with strong user and [device identity](
../../access-controls/device-trust/guide.mdx) provides the best available
security for client authentication.

For customers that require IP-based control for compliance purposes, we do
support IP Pinning. For more information see `pin_source_ip` in our [Teleport
Access Controls Reference](../../access-controls/reference.mdx).

### Are internal connections encrypted / authenticated?

Teleport components communicate with themselves using mTLS, with a separate certificate authority for each tenant. Connections to AWS services, such as DynamoDB and
S3, are established using encryption provided by AWS, both at rest and in transit. Each tenant has its own credentials that isolate it to interacting with only its own data.
## Connecting resources

### How do I add resources to Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

You can connect servers, Kubernetes clusters, databases, desktops, and
applications using [reverse
tunnels](../../agents/join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx).

There is no need to open any ports on your infrastructure for inbound traffic.

### What is the maximum number of agents a customer can connect to their cluster?

If you plan on connecting more than 10,000 nodes or agents, please contact your account executive or customer support to ensure your tenant is properly scaled.

### Should we use Enterprise or Teleport Community Edition for connecting resources to our Teleport cluster?
(!docs/pages/includes/ent-vs-community-faq.mdx!)

### Are dynamic node tokens available?

After [connecting](#how-can-i-access-the-tctl-admin-tool) `tctl` to Teleport Enterprise Cloud, users can generate
[dynamic tokens](../../agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token.mdx):

```code
$ tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node,proxy --token=$(uuid)
```

## Using `tctl`

### How can I access the `tctl` admin tool?

Find the appropriate download at [Teleport Enterprise Cloud Downloads](./downloads.mdx). Use the Enterprise version of `tctl`.

After downloading the tools, first log in to your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl` remotely:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=example.teleport.sh
$ tctl status
```

### Why am I getting `permission denied` errors when using `tctl`?

If you have a local file `/etc/teleport.yaml` on your machine `tctl` will attempt to use the local cluster. Set the environment variable `TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE` to `""` so it will not attempt to use that Teleport configuration file.

```code
$ export TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE=""
$ tctl tokens add --type=node
```

## Audit events and session recordings

### Is there a way to forward Teleport Enterprise Cloud audit events to my company's internal Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)?

Yes. We recommend Teleport's [event handler plugin](../../management/export-audit-events/fluentd.mdx) to export Teleport Enterprise Cloud audit events.

### Is it possible to store audit logs and session recordings in my own S3 bucket?

Yes, you can configure [External Audit Storage](./external-audit-storage.mdx).

### Is it possible to enable proxy recording mode?

Proxy recording mode is disabled for cloud customers

### Is there a way to download session recordings for easy playback?

The ability to download recordings for offline viewing will be available in a future release.

## Updates

### Will Teleport be updated automatically?

The Teleport Auth Service and Teleport Proxy Service for Teleport Enterprise Cloud
are automatically kept up to date with patches and minor releases following the release schedule
described in [Teleport Upcoming Releases](../../upcoming-releases.mdx).

- Major version updates for the Teleport Auth Service and Teleport Proxy Service typically occur
  one month after new major versions are released.
- Minor updates and patches typically occur between one day and a week after a release.
- Teleport Auth Service and Teleport Proxy Service updates are pushed to Teleport cloud accounts
  during your scheduled maintenance window.
- Teleport agents are only updated automatically if you enroll them in automatic updates.

If you have Teleport agents connected to a Teleport Enterprise Cloud cluster
that are more than one major version behind, you might experience compatibility
issues unless your agents are enrolled in automatic updates. See the [Upgrading
Overview](../../upgrading/overview.mdx) for more information.

To get version information for your agents, see [How can I find version information on
connected agents?](#how-can-i-find-version-information-on-connected-agents).

For more information about automatic updates and compatibility issues, contact
[Teleport support](https://goteleport.com/support/).

### Are updates times configurable for Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

Yes, Teleport provides a scheduled maintenance time window for updates and you can set
the start time for the maintenance window that works best for your organization. The
scheduled maintenance windows applies for all updates, including patches and agent updates
for all Teleport Cloud accounts. Updates for your cluster won't start earlier than the
maintenance window start time you set.

To set the maintenance window start time, select your username in the Teleport Web UI,
then click **Help & Support**. Under Scheduled Upgrades, you can see the current
maintenance window start time. Click **Edit** to set a different start time for
scheduled maintenance.

Teleport recommends you check the status of Teleport Cloud at
[status.teleport.sh](https://status.teleport.sh). From the status page, click
**Subscribe to Updates** to get email notifications whenever Teleport Cloud creates,
updates, or resolves an incident and stay informed about scheduled maintenance and
new releases.

### When are agents automatically updated?

Teleport Enterprise Cloud must be set to receive automatic updates to use the
Teleport Cloud version server for automatic agent updates. With automatic agent
updates, agents periodically check the version server for new releases and
update the software when new versions are found.

If you enroll in automatic agent updates, Teleport agents are automatically 
updated after your Teleport cluster is updated during your scheduled maintenance 
period. For more information, read one of the following guides:

- [Upgrading Teleport Cloud Agents on
  Kubernetes](../../upgrading/cloud-kubernetes.mdx)
- [Upgrading Teleport Cloud Agents on
  Linux Servers](../../upgrading/cloud-linux.mdx)

### How can I find version information on connected agents?

To find the version of Teleport agent is attached to your cluster, run the
following commands for the different protocols we support.

```code
$ tctl get nodes --format=text
$ tctl get kube_server --format=text
$ tctl get app_server --format=text
$ tctl get db_server --format=text
$ tctl get windows_desktop_service --format=text
```

Below you can see sample output of `tctl get nodes --format=text`. Note the
`Version` column will contain the version of the attached agent.

```code
$ tctl get nodes --format=text
Host     UUID                                 Public Address Labels Version
-------- ------------------------------------ -------------- ------ ----------
server01 46d8cad0-8967-4815-a01a-77aae62c34fe                       (=teleport.version=)
server02 c33b5513-a9eb-463b-8f1b-1f209afe5b4f                       (=teleport.version=)
```

## Architecture and networking

### Which Proxy Service ports are open on my Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant?

Teleport Enterprise Cloud allocates a different set of ports to each tenant. To see which
ports are available for your Teleport Enterprise Cloud tenant, run a command similar to the
following, replacing `example.teleport.sh` with your tenant domain:

```code
$ curl https://example.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.proxy'
```

The output should resemble the following, including the unique ports assigned to
your tenant:

```json
{
  "kube": {
    "enabled": true,
    "public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11107",
    "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3026"
  },
  "ssh": {
    "listen_addr": "[::]:3023",
    "tunnel_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3024",
    "public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:443",
    "ssh_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11105",
    "ssh_tunnel_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11106"
  },
  "db": {
    "postgres_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11109",
    "mysql_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3036",
    "mysql_public_addr": "example.teleport.sh:11108"
  },
  "tls_routing_enabled": true
}
```

This output also indicates whether TLS routing is enabled for your tenant. When
TLS routing is enabled, connections to a Teleport service (e.g., the Teleport
SSH Service) are routed through the Proxy Service's public web address, rather
than through a port allocated to that service.

In this case, you can see that TLS routing is enabled, and that the Proxy
Service's public web address (`ssh.public_addr`) is `example.teleport.sh:443`.

Read more in our [TLS Routing](../../architecture/tls-routing.mdx) guide.

### How does Teleport manage web certificates? Can I upload my own?

Teleport uses [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) to issue
certificates for every customer. It is not possible to upload a custom
certificate or use a custom domain name.

### Where does Teleport Enterprise Cloud run?

Teleport Cloud runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We run proxies in a variety 
of regions all over the world, and allow customers to [select the region](./architecture.mdx#auth-service) where the data is stored.

### Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?

We use AWS-managed keys. Currently there is no option to provide your own key.

### Is this Teleport's S3 bucket, or my bucket based on my AWS credentials?

It's a Teleport-managed S3 bucket with AWS-managed keys by default.

Configuring [External Audit Storage](./external-audit-storage.mdx) will allow
you to use your own S3 bucket.

### Is IPv6 Supported for connections to Teleport Enterprise Cloud?

We don't currently support IPv6 connections to Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

### Can I change the domain name of my Cloud instance after it's been created?

We're currently researching whether this can be done, so please contact support at support@goteleport.com.

### Is FIPS mode an option?

FIPS is not currently an option for Teleport Enterprise Cloud clusters.


## Performance and reliability

### Can I use Teleport Enterprise Cloud in production?

Yes. Large organizations leverage Teleport Enterprise Cloud to manage the vast number of resources in their organization. Teleport Enterprise Cloud is audited regularly to ensure the most reliable and secure service possible is available to our customers.

### What is the Cloud SLA?

Teleport Enterprise Cloud commits to an SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=) of monthly uptime,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month. While we routinely exceed this SLA,
this number reflects risks in our architecture that we will improve over time.

### Is there a status page available?

[status.teleport.sh](https://status.teleport.sh)

### Can I get push notifications of Teleport Enterprise Cloud downtime?

Yes. Customers can subscribe to Teleport Enterprise Cloud updates at [status.teleport.sh](https://status.teleport.sh).

### Can I retrieve diagnostics from my hosted cluster?

We currently don't expose any metrics interfaces for a tenant.

For our own metrics collection, we're rolling out mTLS, so that only authorized internal clients may collect or scrape metrics from the running instances.
This design does not include a mechanism to issue mTLS certificates to external clients, while maintaining isolation guarantees that one tenant cannot interact with another tenant.

Teleport cloud tenants are made up of a cluster of processes, with designated processes sitting behind a load balancer. To scrape the entire cluster would require each component of
the Teleport cluster to be individually addressable and accessible from external sources. This could allow individual components to be selectively attacked, if an adversary is able to
address traffic to any individual software instance within the cluster.

### How do I set up recovery codes for my account so I don't lose access?

We have a [short step-by-step guide](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/discussions/12379) on setting up recovery codes.
