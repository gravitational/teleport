title: Teleport Configuration Reference
description: The detailed guide and reference documentation for configuring Teleport for SSH and Kubernetes access.
---

Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A full configuration
reference file is shown below. This provides comments and all available options
for `teleport.yaml`. 

By default, Teleport reads its configuration from `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

## Before using this reference

<Notice type="danger">

Do not use this example configuration in production.

</Notice>

You must edit your configuration file to meet the needs of your environment.
Using a copy of the reference configuration will have unintended effects. To
create a configuration file that you can use as a starting point, run the
following command:

```code
$ teleport configure -o file
```

There are also `configure` commands available for the SSH Service and Database
Service. See our documentation on `teleport node configure` and `teleport db
configure` in the [Teleport CLI Reference](cli.mdx#teleport).

<Notice type="warning">

You should back up your configuration file before making changes. This will
enable you to roll back to the previous configuration if you need to.  

</Notice>

## Enabling Teleport services

The `teleport` process can run multiple services. 

For some services, you must enable the service within your Teleport
configuration in order to start it. Other services are enabled by default. 

To enable or disable a service, include the following in your Teleport
configuration, replacing `service_name` with the name of your service (service
names are listed below):

```yaml
service_name:
  enabled: "no"
```

Teleport supports the following services:

|Service|Configuration section|Enabled by default|
|---|---|---|
|Application Service|`app_service`|❌|
|Auth Service|`auth_service`|✅|
|Database Service|`db_service`|❌|
|Discovery Service|`discovery_service`|❌|
|Kubernetes Service|`kubernetes_service`|❌|
|Proxy Service|`proxy_service`|✅|
|SSH Service|`ssh_service`|✅|
|Desktop Service|`windows_desktop_service`|❌|

Teleport Cloud manages the Auth Service and Proxy Service for you. Instances of
Teleport services (e.g., the Application Service and Database Service) should
include the following configuration options to avoid unintended effects:

```yaml
auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Reference configuration file

This example configuration includes all possible configuration options in YAML
format to demonstrate proper use of indentation:

```yaml
# By default, this file should be stored in /etc/teleport.yaml

# Configuration file version. The current version is "v3".
version: v3

# This section of the configuration file applies to all teleport
# services.
teleport:
    # nodename allows one to assign an alternative name this node can be
    # reached by. By default it's equal to hostname.
    nodename: graviton

    # Data directory where Teleport daemon keeps its data.
    # See "Storage backends" for more details
    # (https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/reference/backends/).
    data_dir: /var/lib/teleport

    # PID file for Teleport process
    #pid_file: /var/run/teleport.pid

    # The invitation token or an absolute path to a file containing the token used
    # to join a cluster. It is not used on subsequent starts.
    # If using a file, it only needs to exist when teleport is first ran.
    #
    # File path example:
    # auth_token: /var/lib/teleport/tokenjoin
    #
    # This is the same as setting join_params.method to "token", and join_params.token_name
    # to the value of auth_token.
    # You should only use either auth_token or join_params.
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # join_params are parameters to set when joining a cluster via
    # EC2, IAM or a token.
    #
    # EC2 join method documentation:
    # https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws-ec2/
    # IAM join method documentation:
    # https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/guides/joining-nodes-aws-iam/
    join_params:
        # When `method` is set to "token", it is the equivalent to using `auth_token` above.
        # You should only use either auth_token or join_params.
        method: "token"|"ec2"|"iam"

        # If method is "iam" or "ec2", token_name will be will be the name of
        # the joining token resource, e.g., "ec2-token" or "iam-token" as created
        # in the Joining Nodes via EC2 or IAM guides.

        # If method is "token", token_name will be the invitation token
        # or an absolute path to a file containing the token used to join a cluster.
        # It is not used on subsequent starts.
        # If using a file, it only needs to exist when teleport is first ran.
        #
        # File path example:
        # token_name: /var/lib/teleport/tokenjoin
        token_name: "token-name"

    # Optional CA pin of the auth server. This enables a more secure way of
    # adding new nodes to a cluster. See "Adding Nodes to your Cluster"
    # (https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/admin/adding-nodes).

    # When running in multi-homed or NATed environments Teleport Nodes need
    # to know which IP it will be reachable at by other Nodes.
    #
    # This value can be specified as FQDN e.g. host.example.com
    advertise_ip: 10.1.0.5


    # Teleport provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring purposes. They are
    # disabled by default but you can enable them using the diagnosis address.
    # See the Teleport metrics reference:
    # https://goteleport.com/docs/setup/diagnostics/metrics
    diag_addr: "127.0.0.1:3000"


    # Only use one of auth_server or proxy_server.
    #
    # When you have either the Application Service or Database Service enabled,
    # only tunneling through the proxy is supported, so you should specify proxy_server.
    # All other services support both tunneling through the proxy and directly connecting
    # to the auth server, so you can specify either auth_server or proxy_server.

    # Auth Server address and port to connect to. If you enable the Teleport
    # Auth Server to run in High Availability configuration, the address should
    # point to a Load Balancer.
    # If adding a node located behind NAT, use the Proxy URL (e.g. teleport-proxy.example.com:443)
    # and set `proxy_server` instead.
    auth_server: 10.1.0.5:3025

    # Proxy Server address and port to connect to. If you enable the Teleport
    # Proxy Server to run in High Availability configuration, the address should
    # point to a Load Balancer.
    proxy_server: teleport-proxy.example.com:443

    # cache:
