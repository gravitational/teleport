description: Values that can be set using the teleport-access-graph Helm chart
---

The `teleport-access-graph` Helm chart deploys the Teleport Access Graph service.

See [Run Teleport Access Graph on Self-Hosted Clusters with Helm](../../access-controls/access-graph/self-hosted-helm.mdx)
for more details.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Version Compatibility">
The chart is versioned with the Teleport Access Graph service. No compatibility
guarantees are ensured if the service and chart versions differ.
It is strongly recommended to always align the chart and service versions
by using the `--version` Helm flag.
</Admonition>
