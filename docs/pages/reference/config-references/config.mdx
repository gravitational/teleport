Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A full configuration
reference file is shown below. This provides comments and all available options
for `teleport.yaml`.

By default, Teleport reads its configuration from `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

## Before using this reference

<Notice type="danger">

Do not use this example configuration in production.

</Notice>

You must edit your configuration file to meet the needs of your environment.
Using a copy of the reference configuration will have unintended effects. To
create a configuration file that you can use as a starting point, run the
following command:

```code
$ teleport configure -o file
```

There are also `configure` commands available for the SSH Service and Database
Service. See our documentation on `teleport node configure` and `teleport db
configure` in the [Teleport CLI Reference](cli/teleport.mdx).

<Notice type="warning">

You should back up your configuration file before making changes. This will
enable you to roll back to the previous configuration if you need to.

</Notice>

## Enabling Teleport services

The `teleport` process can run multiple services.

For some services, you must enable the service within your Teleport
configuration in order to start it. Other services are enabled by default.

To enable or disable a service, include the following in your Teleport
configuration, replacing `service_name` with the name of your service (service
names are listed below):

```yaml
service_name:
  enabled: "no"
```

Teleport supports the following services:

|Service|Configuration section|Enabled by default|
|---|---|---|
|Application Service|`app_service`|❌|
|Auth Service|`auth_service`|✅|
|Database Service|`db_service`|❌|
|Discovery Service|`discovery_service`|❌|
|Kubernetes Service|`kubernetes_service`|❌|
|Proxy Service|`proxy_service`|✅|
|SSH Service|`ssh_service`|✅|
|Desktop Service|`windows_desktop_service`|❌|
|Jamf Service|`jamf_service`|❌|

Teleport Cloud manages the Auth Service and Proxy Service for you. Instances of
Teleport services (e.g., the Application Service and Database Service) should
include the following configuration options to avoid unintended effects:

```yaml
auth_service:
  enabled: false

proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Reference configurations

These example configurations include all possible configuration options in YAML
format to demonstrate proper use of indentation.

Choose a Teleport service to view the application configuration options:

### Instance-wide settings

These settings apply to any `teleport` instance:

```yaml
(!docs/pages/includes/config-reference/instance-wide.yaml!)
```

### Proxy Service

These settings apply to the Teleport Proxy Service:

Teleport Enterprise Cloud manages the Proxy Service for you, so you do not need
to specify these configuration settings.

```

### Auth Service

These settings apply to the Teleport Auth Service:

<Notice type="tip">
Teleport Enterprise Cloud manages the Auth Service for you, so you do not need
to specify these configuration settings.

## Configuration versions

In order to avoid breaking existing configurations, Teleport's configuration is
versioned. The newer configuration version is `v3`. If a `version` is not
specified in the configuration file, `v1` is assumed.

Some new Teleport features require users to opt-in by explicitly upgrading their
configuration to a newer version.

### Config `v1`

`v1` is the original version of Teleport's file configuration. It is still supported
today, but most new users should start with the latest configuration version.

### Config `v2`

Configuration version `v2` was introduced in Teleport 8 as part of Teleport's
TLS routing feature. With TLS routing, Teleport's proxy listens on a single port
and uses ALPN and SNI to route incoming traffic to the correct Teleport service
rather than listening on multiple protocol-specific ports.

For backwards compatibility, configuration version `v1` always listens on these
protocol-specific ports. When Teleport is using configuration version `v2`, the
individual protocol-specific ports are not opened unless explicitly set.

### Config `v3`

Configuration version `v3` was introduced with Teleport 11. In version 3, the
`auth_servers` field is no longer supported, and agents must specify one of
`auth_server` or `proxy_server` to indicate which endpoint to use for joining a
Teleport cluster.

Previous versions of Teleport allowed for `auth_servers` to point to Auth
Servers or Proxy Servers. As a result, Teleport would try to connect in multiple
different modes, resulting in confusing error messages. With config version 3,
Teleport only attempts to connect in a single mode, which is both more efficient
and easier to troubleshoot.

For example, this excerpt from a `v2` config can be converted to `v3` with the
following changes.

```diff
-version: v2
+version: v3
teleport:
-  auth_servers: [ teleport.example.com:443 ]
+  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
```
