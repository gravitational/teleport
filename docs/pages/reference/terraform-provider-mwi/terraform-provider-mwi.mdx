The Teleport MWI Terraform provider generates short-lived credentials using
[Teleport Machine & Workload Identity (MWI)](../../machine-workload-identity/machine-workload-identity.mdx)
that can be used to grant other Terraform providers access to resources.

To manage the configuration of Teleport itself, use the [Teleport Terraform
Provider instead](../terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx).

is reserved by the generator for the catch-all resource template */}

## Example usage

In this example, we will use the Teleport MWI Terraform provider to grant the
Kubernetes provider access to a Kubernetes cluster through Teleport.

Our Kubernetes cluster is enrolled in Teleport under the name `my-cluster`, and
we've setup a Bot and Join Token to allow our Terraform provider to authenticate
to Teleport.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    teleportmwi = {
      source = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleportmwi"
      version = "~> (=teleport.major_version=).0"
    }
    kubernetes = {
      source = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleportmwi" {
  join_method = "gitlab"
  join_token = "my-join-token"
  proxy_server = "example.teleport.sh:443"
}

ephemeral "teleportmwi_kubernetes" "my_cluster" {
  selector = {
    name = "my-cluster"
  }
}


// https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs
provider "kubernetes" {
  host                   = ephemeral.teleportmwi_kubernetes.my_cluster.output.host
  tls_server_name        = ephemeral.teleportmwi_kubernetes.my_cluster.output.tls_server_name
  client_certificate     = ephemeral.teleportmwi_kubernetes.my_cluster.output.client_certificate
  client_key             = ephemeral.teleportmwi_kubernetes.my_cluster.output.client_key
  cluster_ca_certificate = ephemeral.teleportmwi_kubernetes.my_cluster.output.cluster_ca_certificate
}

resource "kubernetes_namespace" "ns" {
  metadata {
    name = "example-namespace"
  }
}
```

## Ephemeral resources vs data sources

The MWI Terraform provider exposes functionality using two different kinds of
entity in the Terraform ecosystem: **ephemeral resources** and **data sources**.

Ephemeral resources are supported by Terraform 1.10 and later, and should be
the preferred way to use the MWI Terraform provider. They have the following
benefits over data sources:

- The short-lived credentials generated by the MWI Terraform provider will not
  be persisted within the Terraform state.
- Fresh short-lived credentials will be generated in the apply phase, allowing
  you to grant read-only privileges to plan runs and read-write privileges to
  apply runs.

When using a version of Terraform that does not support ephemeral resources,
you can use the data source variants instead. When using the data sources,
keep the following in mind:

- The short-lived secrets generated by the MWI Terraform provider will be
  persisted within the Terraform state. The secrets will be generated in the
  plan phase and reused in the apply phase. We therefore highly recommend that
  you encrypt your Terraform state file.
- You will need to configure a `credential_ttl` that will ensure that credentials
  generated during the plan phase will still be valid during the apply phase.

## Schema

### Required

- `join_method` (String) The join method to use to authenticate to the Teleport cluster.
- `join_token` (String) The name of the join token to use to authenticate to the Teleport cluster.
- `proxy_server` (String) The address of the Teleport Proxy service. This should exclude the scheme but should include the port.

### Optional

- `insecure` (Boolean) When enabled, the certificates of the Proxy will not be verified. This is not recommended for production use.
