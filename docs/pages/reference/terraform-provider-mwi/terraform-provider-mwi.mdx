The Teleport MWI Terraform provider generates short-lived credentials using
Teleport Machine & Workload Identity (MWI) that can be used to grant other
Terraform providers access to resources.

For example, you can use the Teleport MWI Terraform provider to grant the
Kubernetes Terraform provider access to a Kubernetes cluster.

To manage the configuration of Teleport itself, use the [Teleport Terraform
Provider instead](../terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx).

is reserved by the generator for the catch-all resource template */}

## Schema

### Required

- `join_token` (String) The name of the join token to use to authenticate to the Teleport cluster.
- `proxy_server` (String) The address of the Teleport Proxy service. This should exclude the scheme but should include the port.

### Optional
