title: Agent Update Management 
description: This chapter explains how Teleport agent automatic update is working.
---

While many Teleport resources [support agentless
mode](../../faq.mdx), agent deployments
are sometimes simpler and more convenient. However, large Teleport deployments
can create an additional burden: updating all agents.

Teleport supports automatic agent updates for systemd-based
Linux distributions using `apt`, `yum` or `zypper` package managers, and Kubernetes clusters.

## Update logic and failure modes

An updater is a piece of software deployed next to an agent which is responsible
for updating it. Updating multiple agents requires multiple updaters.

We designed the updater to be as decoupled from Teleport as possible. The
updater can update agents even when they cannot join the Teleport cluster.
Pushing a broken version can happen, but a rollback/roll-forward must always
be possible without manually connecting to the resource and fixing the agent.

The updater recurrently fetches the target version from a version server and
updates the agent to the target version. Because restarting the agent can
disrupt currently open sessions, it will only update the agent in two cases:
during a maintenance window or when the agent is unhealthy.

When enrolled in a cluster with automatic updates, the agent will retrieve
its maintenance schedule from the Teleport cluster and save it. When a
maintenance schedule is available, the updater will honour it. However, if
the updater cannot find the maintenance schedule, it will consider the agent
unhealthy and perform updates as soon as possible. Similarly, if the updater
detects the agent is unhealthy, it immediately applies any pending update to
try to recover from a degraded state.

We implemented an additional failsafe: the critical maintenance toggle.
The version server can specify that an update is critical. Critical updates are
applied even if the updater is outside its regular maintenance window.

## Security

When updating the agent, the updater will ensure the new version's authenticity
before deploying it. On Linux distributions using `apt`, `yum` or `zypper`, it relies on
the existing package signature system. On Kubernetes-based environments, it
validates the OCI image signature (using [cosign's signature
](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/SIGNATURE_SPEC.md)).

## Version server and source of truth

The agent version is subject to the following constraints:

- the agent must never exceed the Proxy or Auth Service version,
- the agent must always be no more than one major version below the Proxy or Auth
  Service version.

The best practice is to always align the agent version with the version of the
Proxy Service and Auth Service. To upgrade the Auth Service and Proxy Service,
follow [the Teleport Cluster upgrade guide](../../upgrading/upgrading.mdx).

For this reason, all updaters must subscribe to a release channel targeting
versions that are compatible with their Teleport cluster. Teleport Cloud users
must use the Teleport Cloud version server with the `stable/cloud` release
channel. Self-hosted Teleport users must host their own version server and
either update their release channel each time they update their Auth Service and
Proxy Service instances, or use the `stable/rolling` channel.

### Teleport Cloud

If you are using Teleport Cloud you can use Teleport Cloud's version server
only if an instance is enrolled in automatic updates. This version server will always
target the best version from a feature, compatibility, security and stability
point of view.

If your Teleport Cloud control plane is not automatically updated you must not use
automatic agent updates. This is because your Teleport instance version might
differ from the other Teleport Cloud instances and might not yet support the
latest agent version.

### Self-hosted Teleport

If you are self-hosting Teleport Enterprise you can set up automatic agent updates.
The updater uses a version channel to retrieve the targeted version for an agent.
The Teleport Proxy Service provides a default version channel that matches to its current version.
You can configure the default version and set additional channel versions.

You are responsible for ensuring the version channels are compatible with the
current Teleport Proxy Service and Teleport Auth Service versions. You must also
monitor the agent's health and rollout status to ensure every agent is healthy
and running the correct version.

## Next steps

Self-hosted users must first [set up self-hosted automatic agent upgrades
](../../upgrading/automatic-agent-updates.mdx).

After that, you can set enroll agents in automatic updates as part of the
[upgrading procedure](../../upgrading/upgrading.mdx).
