title: Managed Updates
description: This chapter explains how Teleport Agent Managed Updates work.
---

While many Teleport resources [support agentless
mode](../../faq.mdx), agent deployments
are sometimes simpler and more convenient. However, large Teleport deployments
can create an additional burden: updating all agents.

There are two versions of Teleport Agent Managed Updates:
- **Version 1:** Supports systemd-based
  Linux distributions using `apt`, `yum` or `zypper` package managers,
  as well as Kubernetes clusters.
- **Version 2:** Removes the package manager dependency from v1, supports a
  wider range of setups (e.g., Teleport Community Edition, Teleport Enterprise, FIPS, and multiple agents on a single
  host) and offers more control over the update schedule.

## Update logic and failure modes

An updater is a piece of software deployed next to an agent which is responsible
for updating it. Updating multiple agents requires multiple updaters.

We designed the updater to be as decoupled from Teleport as possible. The
updater can update agents even when they cannot join the Teleport cluster.
Pushing a broken version can happen, but a rollback/roll-forward must always
be possible without manually connecting to the resource and fixing the agent.

The updater recurrently fetches the target version from a version server and
updates the agent to the target version. Because restarting the agent can
disrupt currently open sessions, it will only update the agent in two cases:
during a maintenance window or when the agent is unhealthy.

### Version 2 update logic

In Managed Updates version 2, the Teleport cluster itself drives the updates by
telling each agent if it should update or not. Centralizing the update decision
offers more control over the rollout. As the Teleport cluster sees every agent,
it can more complex decisions such as gradually rolling out an update, or
detecting a faulty update.

In version 2, the updater will monitor the agent after an update. If the agent
fails to come back healthy, the updater will automatically initiate a rollback
to the last working version in an attempt to restore connectivity.

### Version 1 update logic

In Managed Updates version 1, the updater drives the update, and Teleport is only
responsible for providing it the version schedule.

When a maintenance schedule is available, the updater will honor it. However, if
the updater cannot find the maintenance schedule, it will consider the agent
unhealthy and perform updates as soon as possible. Similarly, if the updater
detects the agent is unhealthy, it immediately applies any pending update to
try to recover from a degraded state.

We implemented an additional failsafe: the critical maintenance toggle.
The version server can specify that an update is critical. Critical updates are
applied even if the updater is outside its regular maintenance window.

## Security

### Version 2 security invariants

The version 2 updater fetches binaries from its CDN over TLS and validates
integrity via a shasum. The agent uses the official Teleport CDN by default.
A custom CDN can be configured at the updater level. For security reasons,
there are no way to remotely reconfigure the updater CDN and have it install
arbitrary binaries.

Binaries are currently not signed, this might change in the future.
OCI artifacts (Docker images) are signed using [cosign's signature format
](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/SIGNATURE_SPEC.md).

### Version 1 security invariants

When updating the agent, the updater will ensure the new version's authenticity
before deploying it. On Linux distributions using `apt`, `yum` or `zypper`, it relies on
the existing package signature system. On Kubernetes-based environments, it
validates the OCI image signature (using [cosign's signature
](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/SIGNATURE_SPEC.md)).


## Version server and source of truth

The agent version is subject to the following constraints:

- the agent must never exceed the Proxy or Auth Service version,
- the agent must always be no more than one major version below the Proxy or Auth
  Service version.

The best practice is to always align the agent version with the version of the
Proxy Service and Auth Service. To upgrade the Auth Service and Proxy Service,
follow [the Teleport Cluster upgrade guide](../../upgrading/upgrading.mdx).

Updaters are discovering the version they should run by querying the Teleport
proxy.

### Teleport Cloud

If you are using Teleport Cloud the target version is managed for you.
In Managed Updates version 1, you can configure the maintenance window.
In Managed Updates version 2, you can configure custom update schedules and
control when and in which order agents are updated.

### Self-hosted Teleport

If you are self-hosting Teleport Enterprise you can set up automatic agent updates.
You are responsible for configuring the desired agent version. You must also
monitor the agent's health and rollout status to ensure agents are healthy and
updated properly.

## Next steps

[Configure automatic updates v2](../../upgrading/agent-managed-updates.mdx).

After that, you can set enroll agents in automatic updates as part of the
[upgrading procedure](../../upgrading/upgrading.mdx).
