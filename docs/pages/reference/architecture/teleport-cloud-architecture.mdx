## Security

We have designed the Teleport Enterprise Cloud environment to be secure. We work with independent
security auditors on a regular basis to identify and correct any gaps, while also
continuing to iterate on improvements to fortify the platform for the most strict of
compliance use-cases.

The Teleport Enterprise Cloud environment is protected from network and transport layer DDoS attacks 
that may target Teleport tenants by leveraging [AWS Shield](https://aws.amazon.com/shield/).

## Compliance

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

## Managed Teleport Settings

SSH sessions are recorded [on nodes](agents.mdx).
Teleport Enterprise Cloud Proxy does not terminate SSH sessions when using OpenSSH and `tsh` sessions.
The Cloud Proxy terminates TLS for Application, Database, and Kubernetes sessions.

## Data retention
All Teleport Enterprise Cloud customers have audit logs retained in S3 for 4 years, cluster
configuration retained in DynamoDB indefinitely, and session recordings retained in S3 indefinitely.

Customers whose subscriptions lapse will have all session recordings, audit logs, and
cluster state deleted between 7 and 30 days after the lapse.

Customers can configure [External Audit Storage](../../admin-guides/management/external-audit-storage.mdx) to store audit logs and session recordings in their
own AWS account where retention period can be managed independently.

## High Availability

### Auth Service
The Teleport [Auth Service](authentication.mdx) is deployed in 2 AWS availability zones, and can tolerate a single zone failure. AWS guarantees [99.99%](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/) of monthly uptime.
Teleport Enterprise Cloud can run in one of the following AWS regions:

- us-west-2
- us-east-1
- eu-central-1
- ap-south-1
- ap-southeast-1
- sa-east-1

### Proxies
The Teleport [Proxy Service](proxy.mdx) is deployed to multiple AWS regions around the world for low-latency access to distributed infrastructure.

- us-west-2
- us-east-1
- eu-central-1
- ap-south-1
- ap-southeast-1
- sa-east-1

## Releases

Teleport Enterprise Cloud only serves the latest stable release of the Teleport software
for its customers.

Teleport Enterprise Cloud team upgrades the service with patch releases weekly and major
releases quarterly. The team waits for the first minor release before a major
upgrade. For example, the team will deploy (=cloud.major_version=).1.0
instead of (=cloud.major_version=).0.0. The first minor release happens 3-4
weeks after a first major release.

Patch releases are fully backward compatible and require no actions by the
customer.

Major releases do require customers to upgrade all instances of Teleport they
are running within 3 months of the upgrade. Failure to upgrade Teleport instances to the
latest major release during this window may lead to compatibility issues with
Teleport Enterprise Cloud and a loss of access to your infrastructure.

## Service Level Agreement

Teleport Enterprise Cloud commits to an SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=) of monthly uptime,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month. As we continue to invest in the
cloud product and infrastructure, the SLA will be increased.
