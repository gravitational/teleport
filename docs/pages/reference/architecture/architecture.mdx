description: Provides detailed information about how Teleport works.

This guide explains the technical architecture of Teleport. Before reading this
guide, we recommend that you read the [Core Concepts](../../core-concepts.mdx)
page, which describes the components of a Teleport cluster.

## Teleport control plane

The Teleport **control plane** consists of the Teleport Auth Service and
Teleport Proxy Service. On Teleport Enterprise (Cloud), the control plane is
fully managed on Teleport infrastructure. Read about [Teleport Enterprise
(Cloud) Architecture](teleport-cloud-architecture.mdx).

### Teleport Auth Service

The Teleport Auth Service performs three main functions:
- **Maintains certificate authorities** that sign host and client certificates
  for components of your Teleport cluster as well as (for certain self-hosted
  resources) your own infrastructure. 
- **Stores cluster configurations** as dynamic resources, including roles, local
  users, and certain kinds of Teleport-protected infrastructure resources.
- **Collects cluster data** such as audit events and session recordings.

Cluster components communicate with the Auth Service to manage certificates,
dynamic resources, audit events, and session recordings through a [gRPC
API](api-architecture.mdx).

For more information about the Teleport Auth Service, read the following guides:

- [Authentication](authentication.mdx)
- [Authorization](authorization.mdx)

### Teleport Proxy Service

The Teleport Proxy Service enables components in a Teleport cluster to
communicate securely with the Teleport Auth Service. With the Proxy Service,
users can use the public internet to access infrastructure in private networks.

The Proxy Service implements an SSH server. Teleport Agents establish reverse
tunnels with the SSH server to receive traffic from (and return traffic to)
Teleport users. Auth Service clients like the Event Handler and Access Request
plugins also route traffic through the Proxy Service's SSH server, and
authenticate to the Proxy Service with an SSH client certificate.

The Proxy Service serves the Teleport Web UI, which in Teleport Enterprise
(Cloud), is available at the address of your Teleport account (e.g.,
`example.teleport.sh`).

- [Proxy Peering](../../admin-guides/management/operations/proxy-peering.mdx)

## Enrolling resources

Administrators can **enroll** infrastructure resources with a Teleport cluster
to provide secure access, RBAC, and auditing. There are three ways to enroll
infrastructure resources with a Teleport cluster:

- **Teleport Agents** proxy traffic from human users to and from
  Teleport-protected infrastructure resources.
- **Machine ID Bots** receive short-lived credentials from the `tbot` binary so
  service accounts can access infrastructure.
- **Trusted clusters** allow a user of one Teleport cluster to access
  infrastructure that is enrolled with another Teleport cluster by federating
  trust across multiple Teleport clusters.

### Teleport Agents

Teleport Agents proxy traffic from users to resources in your infrastructure.
Agents are instances of the `teleport` binary configured to run certain
services, e.g., the Teleport SSH Service and Teleport Kubernetes Service, and
administrators deploy Agents on their own infrastructure.

Agents verify a user's certificate against a certificate authority maintained by
the Teleport Auth Service. Since a user's Teleport roles are encoded in their
certificate, a Teleport Agent can check a user's Teleport roles and permit or
deny access to a resource. 

Agents must establish trust with the Teleport Auth Service when first joining a
cluster, and there is are [variety of
methods](../../enroll-resources/agents/agents.mdx) that
Agents use for this.

Read more about [Teleport Agent Architecture](agents.mdx). You can also read
about the architecture of Teleport Agent features:

- [Automatic Agent updates](agent-update-management.mdx): How a
  Teleport cluster ensures that Agents run the most up-to-date version of the
  `teleport` binary.
- [Automatically discovering Kubernetes
  applications](../../reference/architecture/kubernetes-applications-architecture.mdx):
  The Teleport Discovery Service queries your Kubernetes cluster and registers
  applications with the Teleport Auth Service.
- [Session recordings](session-recording.mdx): Teleport Agents record user
  sessions and send the data to the Auth Service for storage.

### Machine ID

Machine ID is a Teleport system that enables automated services to access
Teleport-protected infrastructure with regularly updated credentials.
Administrators register a Bot user with Teleport that, like a human user, is
assigned Teleport roles. 

Instances of the `tbot` binary communicate with the Teleport Auth Service to
continuously refresh credentials. As with Agents, administrators must deploy
`tbot` instances on their own infrastructure, including on CI/CD platforms such
as GitHub Actions, and [join
them](../../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx) to a cluster.

Read more about [Machine ID Architecture](machine-id-architecture.mdx).

### Trusted clusters

On self-hosted Teleport clusters, you can federate access between Teleport
clusters by enrolling a **trusted cluster** with the Teleport Auth Service.
Users can access resources in a trusted cluster, also called a **leaf cluster**
, by authenticating with a **root cluster**. 

When an administrator joins a leaf cluster to a root cluster, Auth Service
instances of the two clusters communicate to establish trust. Read more about
[Trusted Cluster Architecture](trustedclusters.mdx).
