This section provides an overview of Teleport Machine ID's inner workings.

The initial specification and design for Machine ID can be found in
[the Request For Discussion.](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0064-bot-for-cert-renewals.md)

## What is a bot?

Within Teleport, "bot" refers to a special user that is intended to be used by
a machine. Bots are similar to normal users, but do not authenticate using
static username/password credentials.

A bot does not exist as a single distinct resource within Teleport. Instead,
they comprise three linked resources. These are:

- Bot user: this will be the user that the Machine ID agent authenticates as.
- Bot role: the bot user is assigned the bot role, and the bot role contains
  various permissions that the bot will need to function. For example, the
  ability to watch the certificate authorities and the ability to
  [impersonate roles](#role-impersonation).
- Token: for [onboarding](#joining-and-authentication), a token must exist that
  allows the Machine ID agent to initially authenticate as the bot user. If an
  existing token is not specified, then a single-use token will be created by
  the Auth Service.
- Bot instance: a single instance of a bot. As multiple `tbot` clients can join
  with a single Bot user or a single token, Bot Instances keep a running record
  of unique bot joins.

The creation of these resources is managed by `tctl bots add`.

It is important to recognize the distinction between the bot and an instance
of `tbot`. This is because this is not always a one-to-one relationship, in
many cases there may be multiple `tbot`'s using the same bot identity.

## Role Impersonation

Role Impersonation is an RBAC feature of Teleport that is used heavily by
Machine ID.

Role Impersonation allows a user to generate credentials with a set of requested
roles. The user does not have to hold these roles, but must have been granted
permission to impersonate them. The impersonated credentials still include
the username of the user that generated them, so actions can be attributed to
the user.

These credentials can then be used to complete any action that is allowed by the
role's configured permissions.

In the case of Machine ID, the bot user is assigned a bot role, which includes
permissions to impersonate the roles that the user has configured.

## `tbot`

`tbot` is the binary that acts as the agent for Machine ID on your machines that
need access to resources protected by Teleport. It is typically ran in one of
two modes. By default, it is a daemon-like long-running process. This is
suitable for situations where your machine is long running and will need
continuous access to resources. `tbot` can also run in "oneshot" mode where it
will fetch credentials for your machine once before exiting. This is ideal for
short-lived environments such as CI/CD workflows.

Before `tbot` can be started, at least two parts of configuration will need to
be provided via the configuration file or as arguments provided to `tbot` when
it is executed. This consists of:

- [A join method](#joining-and-authentication) that the bot can use to prove
  that it should be allowed to join the Teleport cluster.
- A series of **outputs**. An output consists of the configuration settings that
  specify where a set of credentials should be output, and any options that
  should be applied to those credentials (for example, what roles should be
  impersonated).

For more detail about the configuration options, see
[the reference.](../machine-id/machine-id.mdx)

On initial load, `tbot` uses the configured join method to obtain a set of
credentials for the bot user from the Teleport Auth Service. It can then use
these credentials to communicate with the Teleport Auth Service as the bot.

Then on a configured regular period `tbot` begins its renewal process. It begins
by refreshing the bot's own credentials, by renewing them or fetching a fresh
set of credentials depending on the configured onboarding method.

For each output provided in the `tbot` configuration, the `tbot` program uses
impersonation to obtain credentials from the Auth Service for the roles
specified in the configuration for that output. After `tbot` fetches the
credentials for its roles, they are then persisted to the output's destination
in various formats along with other useful artifacts such as the current
certificate authority certificates.

Concurrently to this, `tbot` monitors the Teleport certificate authorities to
detect certificate rotations. When this occurs, it triggers additional renewals
to ensure that output destinations continue to have certificates that are signed
by the latest certificate authority.

## Joining and Authentication

Joining is the process by which `tbot` initially authenticates as a bot with the
Teleport Auth Service.

Machine ID leverages the existing token resource within Teleport, with the
token containing an additional `botName` field that identifies the bot user
associated with the token.

Machine ID currently supports two methods of joining that have some key
differences.

### Ephemeral token

- The name of the token is used as an opaque secret needed to join the Teleport
  cluster. This means it must be stored and communicated securely.
- Once used, the token resource self-destructs. This means it can only be used
  to join a single bot to a Teleport cluster.

As these tokens can only be used once, the certificates that are issued when
using an ephemeral token are renewable. This allows the short-lived certificate
to be used to request new short-lived certificate.

In order to mitigate the risk of bot user credentials being stolen, and then
continually renewed by a malicious actor, renewable bot user certificates
validate the bot instance's **generation counter**.

The generation counter is stored as part of the [Bot Instance](#bot-instances)
in the database and within the certificate. This counter is incremented each
time this bot instance renews its certificate. When a bot attempts to renew, the
Auth Service ensures that the value within the certificate and in the database
match. If they do not match, then the bot user is automatically locked. This
means that if certificates are stolen, and attempted to be renewed whilst the
bot is still running, the next renewal will render them useless.

### Dynamic join tokens (e.g AWS IAM)

- These tokens rely on an external authority that allows the bot to prove it is
  allowed to join the cluster. The name of the token identifies the Token
  resource in Teleport that contains the configuration.
- The token can be used to join as many bots as you want, and do not self
  destruct in the same way that ephemeral tokens do.
- The certificates exchanged for the token are not renewable. When the bot wants
  to renew its certificates, it simply repeats the original join steps.

Where possible, you should prefer to use a dynamic join token over an ephemeral
token as this eliminates the need to handle a secret.

### Bot Instances

A Bot Instance identifies a single lineage of bot identities, even through
certificate renewals and rejoins. When the `tbot` client first authenticates to
a cluster, a Bot Instance is generated and its UUID is embedded in the returned
client identity.

When that bot later renews or reauthenticates, it authenticates to the Teleport
Auth Service using its previous client certificate, and the Bot Instance ID is
extracted from that identity. A record of the authentication event is stored on
the Teleport Auth Service, along with an identity generation counter. The
generation counter is tracked for all join types (ephemeral and dynamic),
but is currently only enforced for `token`-type joins.

Bot Instances also track a variety of other information about `tbot` instances,
including regular heartbeats which include basic information about the `tbot`
host, like its architecture and OS version.

As tracking Bot Instances requires bots to prove their identity during each
authentication attempt, this does require bots to maintain state if they wish
to keep a single Bot Instance ID over time. It isn't expected or feasible to
keep state for many Machine ID use cases: for example, CI/CD workflows generally
should rejoin from scratch each time. This is expected behavior, and bots with
use cases like this will generate more unique Bot Instances than long-lived
clients.

Bot Instances have a relatively short lifespan and are set to expire after the
most recent identity issued for that instance will expire. If the `tbot` client
associated with a particular Bot Instance renews or rejoins, the expiration of
the bot instance is reset. This is designed to allow users to list Bot Instances
for an accurate view of the number of active `tbot` clients interacting with
their Teleport cluster.

## File permissions

There are two types of folder in use by `tbot`:

- The bot's own files: these store credentials belonging to the `tbot` process
  itself. As these credentials are potentially renewable, and will allow the
  impersonation of any roles you have assigned to the bot user, they should be
  treated as exceptionally sensitive. The bot's own files are stored by default at
  `/var/lib/teleport/bot/`.
- Output destinations: when a directory destination is configured, the bot
  outputs the role impersonated credentials as files in the specified directory.

It is important that we ensure that these files can only be accessed by the
fewest number of Linux processes and users on the system as is necessary.

In the case of the bot's own files, it is best practice to create a Linux user
specifically for running `tbot` and to ensure that only this user has access
to this directory.

In the case of directory destinations, the process the bot runs as requires read
and write permissions, and processes that will need the credentials output by
the bot require read permissions. We recommend that you create a Linux user
specific to the process that needs to access these files. When using
`tbot init`, specify this Linux user as the "reader" to grant it access to the
destination.

In addition to basic POSIX filesystem permissions, `tbot init` also sets up
Linux ACLs if the system supports it. This allows more granular control by
granting individual users access.

Finally, on systems that support it, `tbot` will by default attempt to prevent
the resolution of symbolic links when reading and writing files. This prevents a
class of attacks sometimes known as
[symlink attacks](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/132.html). This
behaviour can be disabled using the `insecure` symlink option when configuring
your destination.
