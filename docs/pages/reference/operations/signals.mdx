description: "Signals you can send to a running teleport process."

You can send the following signals to a `teleport` process to trigger different
functionality.

To send a signal, execute the following command on the host where `teleport` is
running, replacing `SIG` with the name of the signal.

```code
$ kill -SIG
```

| Signal | Teleport Daemon Behavior |
| - | - |
| `USR1` | Dumps diagnostics/debugging information into syslog. |
| `QUIT`| Graceful shutdown. The daemon will stop accepting new connections and it will wait (for up to 30 hours) until existing connections are closed before exiting. |
| `TERM`, `INT` | Immediate non-graceful shutdown. All existing connections will be closed after a very short delay. |
| `USR2` | Forks a new Teleport daemon to serve new connections. |
| `HUP` | Forks a new Teleport daemon to serve new connections **and** initiates the graceful shutdown of the existing process, same as `SIGQUIT`. |
