title: WorkloadIdentity Resource
description: Information about the WorkloadIdentity resource
---

The WorkloadIdentity resource is used to define the structure of an identity
that can be issued to workloads, the rules around what workloads it can be
issued to, and the characteristics of the credentials that will be issued for
that identity.

It supports templating using attributes of the workload, such as the name of the
Kubernetes namespace or service account, which allows the WorkloadIdentity
resource to be used in a generic way for multiple distinct workloads.

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: my-workload
  labels:
    example: foo
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: /foo/bar/{{ join.kubernetes.pod.name }}/{{ join.kubernetes.service_account.name }}
    hint: /foo/bars
```

## Templating

The following fields support templating:

- `spec.spiffe.id`
- `spec.spiffe.hint`
- `spec.spiffe.x509.dns_sans`

## Rules

## Infrastructure as Code

In addition to the YAML representation which can be managed with `tctl`, the
WorkloadIdentity resource can also be managed using Infrastructure as Code
tools.
