title: Workload Identity API & Workload Attestation
description: Information about the `tbot` Workload Identity API service and Workload Attestation functionality
---

The Workload Identity API service (`workload-identity-api`) is a configurable
`tbot` service that allows workloads to request JWT and X509 workload identity
credentials on-the-fly.

It's a more secure alternative to writing credentials to disk and supports
performing a process known as workload attestation to determine attributes of
the workload before issuing credentials.

The Workload Identity API is compatible with two standards:

- [SPIFFE Workload API](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_API.md)
- [Envoy SDS](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/security/secret)

In addition to issuing credentials to workloads, the Workload Identity API can
also provide the trust bundle necessary for workloads to validate the
credentials of other workloads.

## Configuration

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the service. For the Workload Identity API service,
# this will always be `workload-identity-api`.
type: workload-identity-api
# listen specifies the address that the service should listen on.
#
# Two types of listener are supported:
# - TCP: `tcp://<address>:<port>`
# - Unix socket: `unix:///<path>`
listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
# attestors allows Workload Attestation to be configured for this Workload
# API.
attestors:
  # kubernetes is configuration for the Kubernetes Workload Attestor. See
  # the Kubernetes Workload Attestor section for more information.
  kubernetes:
    # enabled specifies whether the Kubernetes Workload Attestor should be
    # enabled. If unspecified, this defaults to false.
    enabled: true
    # kubelet holds configuration relevant to the Kubernetes Workload Attestors
    # interaction with the Kubelet API.
    kubelet:
      # read_only_port is the port on which the Kubelet API is exposed for
      # read-only operations. Since Kubernetes 1.16, the read-only port is
      # typically disabled by default and secure_port should be used instead.
      read_only_port: 10255
      # secure_port is the port on which the attestor should connect to the
      # Kubelet secure API. If unspecified, this defaults to `10250`. This is
      # mutually exclusive with ReadOnlyPort.
      secure_port: 10250
      # token_path is the path to the token file that the Kubelet API client
      # should use to authenticate with the Kubelet API. If unspecified, this
      # defaults to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`.
      token_path: "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token"
      # ca_path is the path to the CA file that the Kubelet API client should
      # use to validate the Kubelet API server's certificate. If unspecified,
      # this defaults to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt`.
      ca_path: "/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt"
      # skip_verify is used to disable verification of the Kubelet API server's
      # certificate. If unspecified, this defaults to false.
      #
      # If specified, the value specified in ca_path is ignored.
      #
      # This is useful in cases where the Kubelet API server has not been issued
      # with a certificate signed by the Kubernetes cluster's CA. This is fairly
      # common with a number of Kubernetes distributions.
      skip_verify: true
      # anonymous is used to disable authentication with the Kubelet API. If
      # unspecified, this defaults to false. If set, the token_path field is
      # ignored.
      anonymous: false

```

## SPIFFE Workload API

The Workload Identity API implements the SPIFFE Workload API, a standardized
API for workloads to request workload identity credentials and trust bundles.

Via this API, both JWT and X509 workload identity credentials can be issued.

## Workload Attestation

Workload Attestation is the process completed by `tbot` to assert the identity
of a workload that has connected to the Workload API and requested credentials.

Workload Attestors are the individual components that perform this attestation.
They use the process ID of the workload to gather information about the workload
from platform-specific APIs. For example, the Kubernetes Workload Attestor
queries the local Kubelet API to determine which Kubernetes pod the process
belongs to.

The result of this attestation process is known as attestation metadata. This
attestation metadata can be included in the rules or templates you configure as
part of a WorkloadIdentity resource.

### Unix

The Unix Workload Attestor is the most basic attestor and allows you to restrict
the issuance of workload identities to specific Unix processes based on a range
of criteria.

#### Support for non-standard procfs mounting

To resolve information about a process from the PID, the Unix Workload Attestor
reads information from the procfs filesystem. By default, it expects procfs to
be mounted at `/proc`.

If procfs is mounted at a different location, you must configure the Unix
Workload Attestor to read from that alternative location by setting the
`HOST_PROC` environment variable.

This is a sensitive configuration option, and you should ensure that it is
set correctly or not set at all. If misconfigured, an attacker could provide
falsified information about processes, and this could lead to the issuance of
SVIDs to unauthorized workloads.

### Kubernetes

The Kubernetes Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of workload
identities to specific Kubernetes workloads based on a range of criteria.

It works by first determining the pod ID for a given process ID and then by
querying the local kubelet API for details about that pod.

#### Deployment Guidance

To use Kubernetes Workload Attestation, `tbot` must be deployed as a daemon
set. This is because the unix domain socket can only be accessed by pods on the
same node as the agent. Additionally, the daemon set must have the `hostPID`
property set to `true` to allow the agent to access information about
processes within other containers.

The daemon set must also have a service account assigned that allows it to query
the Kubelet API. This is an example role with the required RBAC:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tbot
rules:
  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]
    apiGroups: [""]
    verbs: ["get"]
```

Mapping the Workload API Unix domain socket into the containers of workloads
can be done in two ways:

- Directly configuring a hostPath volume for the `tbot` daemonset and workloads
which will need to connect to it.
- Using [spiffe-csi-driver](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe-csi).

Example manifests for required Kubernetes resources:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tbot
rules:
  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]
    apiGroups: [""]

## Envoy SDS

The `workload-identity-api` service endpoint also implements the Envoy SDS API.
This allows it to act as a source of certificates and certificate authorities
for the Envoy proxy.

As a forward proxy, Envoy can be used to attach an X.509 SVID to an outgoing
connection from a workload that is not SPIFFE-enabled.

As a reverse proxy, Envoy can be used to terminate mTLS connections from
SPIFFE-enabled clients. Envoy can validate that the client has presented a valid
X.509 SVID and perform enforcement of authorization policies based on the SPIFFE
ID contained within the SVID.

When acting as a reverse proxy for certain protocols, Envoy can be configured
to attach a header indicating the identity of the client to a request before
forwarding it to the service. This can then be used by the service to make
authorization decisions based on the client's identity.

When configuring Envoy to use the SDS API exposed by the `workload-identity-api`
service, three additional special names can be used to aid configuration:

- `default`: `tbot` will return the default SVID for the workload.
- `ROOTCA`: `tbot` will return the trust bundle for the trust domain that the
workload is a member of.
- `ALL`: `tbot` will return the trust bundle for the trust domain that the
workload is a member of, as well as the trust bundles of any trust domain
that the trust domain is federated with.

The following is an example Envoy configuration that sources a certificate
and trust bundle from the `workload-identity-api` service listening on
`unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock`. It requires that a connecting client
presents a valid SPIFFE SVID and forwards this information to the backend
service in the `x-forwarded-client-cert` header.
