title: Workload Identity API & Workload Attestation
description: Information about the `tbot` Workload Identity API service and Workload Attestation functionality
---

The Workload Identity API service (`workload-identity-api`) is a configurable
`tbot` service that allows workloads to request JWT and X509 workload identity
credentials on-the-fly.

It's a more secure alternative to writing credentials to disk and supports
performing a process known as workload attestation to determine attributes of
the workload before issuing credentials.

The Workload Identity API is compatible with two standards:

- [SPIFFE Workload API](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE_Workload_API.md)
- [Envoy SDS](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/security/secret)

In addition to issuing credentials to workloads, the Workload Identity API can
also provide the trust bundle necessary for workloads to validate the
credentials of other workloads.

## Configuration

```yaml
# type specifies the type of the service. For the Workload Identity API service,
# this will always be `workload-identity-api`.
type: workload-identity-api
# listen specifies the address that the service should listen on.
#
# Two types of listener are supported:
# - TCP: `tcp://<address>:<port>`
# - Unix socket: `unix:///<path>`
listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
# attestors allows Workload Attestation to be configured for this Workload
# API.

    # false.
    enabled: true
    # addr is the address at which the Docker Engine daemon can be reached. It
    # must be in the form `unix://path/to/socket`, as connecting via TCP is not
    # currently supported. If unspecified, this defaults to the standard socket
    # location for "rootful" Docker installations: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.
    addr: unix:///var/run/docker.sock

## SPIFFE Workload API

The Workload Identity API implements the SPIFFE Workload API, a standardized
API for workloads to request workload identity credentials and trust bundles.

Via this API, both JWT and X509 workload identity credentials can be issued.

## Workload Attestation

Workload Attestation is the process completed by `tbot` to assert the identity
of a workload that has connected to the Workload API and requested credentials.

Workload Attestors are the individual components that perform this attestation.
They use the process ID of the workload to gather information about the workload
from platform-specific APIs. For example, the Kubernetes Workload Attestor
queries the local Kubelet API to determine which Kubernetes pod the process
belongs to.

The result of this attestation process is known as attestation metadata. This
attestation metadata can be included in the rules or templates you configure as
part of a WorkloadIdentity resource.

### Unix

The Unix Workload Attestor is the most basic attestor and allows you to restrict
the issuance of workload identities to specific Unix processes based on a range
of criteria.

#### Support for non-standard procfs mounting

To resolve information about a process from the PID, the Unix Workload Attestor
reads information from the procfs filesystem. By default, it expects procfs to
be mounted at `/proc`.

If procfs is mounted at a different location, you must configure the Unix
Workload Attestor to read from that alternative location by setting the
`HOST_PROC` environment variable.

This is a sensitive configuration option, and you should ensure that it is
set correctly or not set at all. If misconfigured, an attacker could provide
falsified information about processes, and this could lead to the issuance of
SVIDs to unauthorized workloads.

#### The `binary_path` and `binary_hash` attributes

The Unix Workload Attestor captures the path and a SHA-256 checksum of the
workload's executable using the `/proc/$pid/exe` symlink. There are a number of
important considerations when using these attributes in your rules:

- `tbot` can only reliably determine the a process' executable path if it's
  running in the same mount namespace. The `binary_path` attribute will likely
  be incorrect if the workload is containerized.
- Because `/proc/$pid/exe` is a symlink to an *inode* rather than a regular path,
  it's usually an accurate representation of what the process is executing even
  if the binary has been replaced on disk (e.g. during a rolling deployment).
  However, network filesystems do not guarantee inode stability, so if the
  process's executable is on a network mount, it's possible for `binary_hash` to
  be out of date.
- By default, `tbot` will only checksum binaries smaller than 1GiB. To change
  this, increase `attestors.unix.binary_hash_max_size_bytes`.

### Kubernetes

The Kubernetes Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of workload
identities to specific Kubernetes workloads based on a range of criteria.

It works by first determining the pod ID for a given process ID and then by
querying the local kubelet API for details about that pod.

#### Deployment Guidance

To use Kubernetes Workload Attestation, `tbot` must be deployed as a daemon
set. This is because the unix domain socket can only be accessed by pods on the
same node as the agent. Additionally, the daemon set must have the `hostPID`
property set to `true` to allow the agent to access information about
processes within other containers.

The daemon set must also have a service account assigned that allows it to query
the Kubelet API. This is an example role with the required RBAC:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tbot
rules:
  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]
    apiGroups: [""]
    verbs: ["get"]
```

Mapping the Workload API Unix domain socket into the containers of workloads
can be done in two ways:

- Directly configuring a hostPath volume for the `tbot` daemonset and workloads
which will need to connect to it.
- Using [spiffe-csi-driver](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe-csi).

Example manifests for required Kubernetes resources:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1

  name: tbot

  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]

## Docker

The Docker Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of workload
identities to specific Docker containers based on a range of criteria.

It works by first determining the container for a given process and then by
querying the Docker Engine API for details about it.

### Granting Access to the Docker Engine API

By default, `tbot` will attempt to connect to the Docker daemon via a Unix
domain socket located at `/var/run/docker.sock` as this is the standard location
for "rootful" Docker deployments.

Unless `tbot` is also running as root, you'll need to add its user to the docker
group to grant it permission to access this socket:

```code
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker $TBOT_USER
```

### Rootless Docker

When running Docker in ["rootless" mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)
the daemon's socket will be located at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock` by default,
making it inaccessible to other non-root users.

If you do not want to run `tbot` as the same user as Docker or as root, you can
override this by creating a configuration file under `~/.config/docker` with the
following contents:

```json
{
  "hosts": ["unix://path/to/socket"]
}
```

## Podman

The Podman Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of workload
identities to specific Podman containers and pods based on a range of criteria.

It works by first determining the container and pod for a given process and then
by querying the [Podman API Service](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-system-service.1.html)
for details about them.

Podman differs from Docker in that it doesn't use a long-running daemon process.
Instead, the API service is typically started on demand using socket activation.

Granting `tbot` access to the Podman API requires different steps depending on
whether you're running "rootfully" or "rootlessly" - it is for this reason we
do not provide a default value for the `attr` config option.

### Rootful Podman

If you're running Podman as root, enable the API service by running:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable --now podman.socket
```

At this point, the service can be reached at `/run/podman/podman.sock` but **only
by root**. If you do not want to run `tbot` as root, you can override the default
systemd unit to make the socket owned by a group your tbot user belongs to:

```code
$ sudo groupadd podman-root
$ sudo usermod -a -G podman-root $TBOT_USER
$ sudo systemctl edit podman.socket
```

In the override file add:

```
[Socket]
SocketGroup=podman-root
```

Reload the systemd daemon and restart the socket unit:

```code
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart podman.socket
```

### Rootless Podman

If you're running Podman as a non-root user, enable and start the API service by
running:

```code
$ sudo loginctl enable-linger $PODMAN_USER
$ systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

The service can now be reached at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock`, but
**only by your chosen podman user or root**. If you do not want to run `tbot`
as the same user or as root, you can override the default systemd unit to move
the socket out of `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and add your tbot user to the podman user's
group:

```code
$ sudo usermod -a -G $PODMAN_USER_GROUP $TBOT_USER
$ systemctl --user edit podman.socket
```

In the override file add:

```
[Socket]
ListenStream=/path/to/socket # Example: /srv/podman.$PODMAN_USER/podman.sock
```

Reload the systemd daemon and restart the socket unit:

```code
$ systemctl --user daemon-reload
$ systemctl --user restart podman.socket
```

### Running `tbot` in a Podman Container

In order for `tbot` running inside a container to attest workloads in other
containers, it must have access to the host's PID namespace. Also, if you are
using group permissions to grant `tbot` access to the Podman socket (see the
above examples) you must set the `run.oci.keep_original_groups` annotation.

```code
$ podman run \
  --pid=host \
  --annotation run.oci.keep_original_groups=1 \
  --volume /path/to/socket:/path/to/socket \
  --volume /path/to/config:/path/to/config \
  public.ecr.aws/gravitational/tbot-distroless:(=teleport.version=) \
  start -c /path/to/config
```

## Systemd

The Systemd Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of workload
identities to specific Systemd services. It works by interacting with Systemd's
[D-Bus API](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/dbus/) to
determine the service unit of a given process.

`tbot` honors the `DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable, but if it's
not set, will default to connecting via a Unix domain socket located at
`/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket`.

If connecting using this socket fails, `tbot` will attempt to use the socket
located at `/run/systemd/private` instead, but this is typically only accessible
by root.

## Envoy SDS

The `workload-identity-api` service endpoint also implements the Envoy SDS API.
This allows it to act as a source of certificates and certificate authorities
for the Envoy proxy.

As a forward proxy, Envoy can be used to attach an X.509 SVID to an outgoing
connection from a workload that is not SPIFFE-enabled.

As a reverse proxy, Envoy can be used to terminate mTLS connections from
SPIFFE-enabled clients. Envoy can validate that the client has presented a valid
X.509 SVID and perform enforcement of authorization policies based on the SPIFFE
ID contained within the SVID.

When acting as a reverse proxy for certain protocols, Envoy can be configured
to attach a header indicating the identity of the client to a request before
forwarding it to the service. This can then be used by the service to make
authorization decisions based on the client's identity.

When configuring Envoy to use the SDS API exposed by the `workload-identity-api`
service, three additional special names can be used to aid configuration:

- `default`: `tbot` will return the default SVID for the workload.
- `ROOTCA`: `tbot` will return the trust bundle for the trust domain that the
workload is a member of.
- `ALL`: `tbot` will return the trust bundle for the trust domain that the
workload is a member of, as well as the trust bundles of any trust domain
that the trust domain is federated with.

The following is an example Envoy configuration that sources a certificate
and trust bundle from the `workload-identity-api` service listening on
`unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock`. It requires that a connecting client
presents a valid SPIFFE SVID and forwards this information to the backend
service in the `x-forwarded-client-cert` header.
