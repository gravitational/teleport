title: WorkloadIdentity Configuration Resource migration
description: Migrating to the new WorkloadIdentity resource configuration
---

The way that you configure Teleport Workload Identity is changing. If you are
currently using Workload Identity, you will need to migrate to the new
configuration experience by V19.0.0 when support for the old configuration
will be removed.

## Overview

Previously, the details of the credentials (e.g X509 SVID/JWT SVID) you wished
to issue were defined directly within `tbot`. Controlling what credentials were
allowed to be issued was done by configuring the `spec.allow.spiffe` field of
the role resource.

The new configuration experience introduces a new resource type, `WorkloadIdentity`,
which allows you to define the structure of an identity credential that can be
issued to workloads and the rules around what workloads it can be issued to.

This provides the following benefits over the previous configuration experience:

- Centralized control of the structure of the identity credential, which
  simplifies the configuration of `tbot`.
- The ability to specify rules based on the attributes of the workload, such as
  the name of the Kubernetes namespace or service account, that is more fine
  grained than the previous configuration.
- The ability to use templating to dynamically generate elements of the identity
  credential - allowing a single WorkloadIdentity resource to be used to serve
  multiple workloads.

You can read the full details of the new WorkloadIdentity resource in the
[WorkloadIdentity Resource](./workload-identity-resource.mdx) reference.

## Migrating `tbot`

The following CLI commands have been replaced:

- `tbot start spiffe-svid` is now `tbot start workload-identity-x509`.

The following new additional CLI commands have been introduced:

- `tbot start workload-identity-api` to start a listener for the Workload
  Identity API.
- `tbot start workload-identity-jwt` to issue a JWT SVID.

You can read more about the new CLI commands in the
[`tbot` CLI reference](../cli/tbot.mdx).

The following service types have been replaced:

- `spiffe-workload-api` is now `workload-identity-api`.
- `spiffe-x509-svid` is now `workload-identity-x509`.

The following new additional service types have been introduced:

- `workload-identity-jwt` to issue JWT SVIDs.

You can read more about the new service types in the
[`tbot` configuration reference](../machine-id/configuration.mdx).
