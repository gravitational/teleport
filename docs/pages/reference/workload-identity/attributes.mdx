title: Workload Identity Attributes
description: Information about the attributes that can be used in templating and rules in the WorkloadIdentity resource.
---

Attributes are features of an identity which you can use with the
[WorkloadIdentity](./workload-identity-resource.mdx) resource to create rules
and template values.

These attributes come from a variety of sources, such as workload attestations
performed by `tbot` or the attestation performed by the control plane when
`tbot` joins.

## Join attributes

Join attributes are sourced from the join process that the Bot underwent. These
typically allow you to identify the machine that the `tbot` agent is running on.

### `join.meta`

The `join.meta` attributes are not related to any specific join method, and
instead typically provide information about the join token that was used to
join.

| Field                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `join.meta.join_token_name` | The name of the join token that was used to join. This field is omitted if the join token that was used to join was of the `token` method as in this case, the name of the join token is sensitive. Example: `my-gitlab-join-token` |
| `join.meta.join_method`     | The name of the join method that was used to join. Example: `gitlab`                                                                                                                                                                |

Workload attributes are sourced from workload attestations performed by `tbot`
when a workload requests an identity via the workload API. They may not be
