title: Workload Identity Revocations
description: Information about performing revocations for issued workload identity credentials
---

The revocations mechanism provides a way to mark an issued X509 workload
identity credential as revoked - indicating to workloads that this credential
should no longer be considered valid.

Typically, the short-lived nature of the X509 SVIDs issued by Teleport Workload
Identity means that revocations are not required. However, in some cases, you
may still desire to revoke an issued credential prior to its expiry.

When an X509 SVID is revoked, a signed Certificate Revocation List will be
distributed to workloads via the Workload API or via a `svid-crl.pem` file
written to a `workload-identity-x509` output.

Workloads and third party services must have explicit support for CRLs to
support them. Support for this functionality can be limited in some
environments, so it is recommended to audit the support for CRLs prior to
leveraging this feature.

## Using `tctl` to revoke an X509 SVID

Before revoking an X509 SVID, you must have the serial number of the X509 SVID
that you wish to revoke. This can be determined via the Teleport audit log.

When creating a revocation, you will also need to provide a reason for the
revocation. This is a free-form string that can be used to provide additional
context for the revocation.

Use `tctl workload-identity revocations add` to create a new revocation:

```code
$ tctl workload-identity revocations add --serial 1234567890 --reason compromised
```
