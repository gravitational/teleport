title: Workload Identity Revocations
description: Information about performing revocations for issued workload identity credentials
---

The revocations mechanism provides a way to mark an issued X509 workload
identity credential as revoked - indicating to workloads that this credential
should no longer be considered valid.

Typically, the short-lived nature of the X509 SVIDs issued by Teleport Workload
Identity means that revocations are not required. However, in some cases, you
may still desire to revoke an issued credential prior to its expiry.

When an X509 SVID is revoked, a signed Certificate Revocation List will be
distributed to workloads via the Workload API or via a `svid-crl.pem` file
written to a `workload-identity-x509` output.

Workloads and third party services must have explicit support for CRLs to
support them. Support for this functionality can be limited in some
environments, so it is recommended to audit the support for CRLs prior to
leveraging this feature.

## Using `tctl` to revoke an X509 SVID

Before revoking an X509 SVID, you must have the serial number of the X509 SVID
that you wish to revoke. This can be determined via the Teleport audit log.

When creating a revocation, you will also need to provide a reason for the
revocation. This is a free-form string that can be used to provide additional
context for the revocation.

Use `tctl workload-identity revocations add` to create a new revocation:

```code
$ tctl workload-identity revocations add --type x509 --serial aabbcc11 --reason compromised
```

## Using `tctl` to list revocations

You can list the currently revoked X509 SVIDs using the `tctl workload-identity
revocations ls` command:

```code
$ tctl workload-identity revocations ls
Type Serial   Revoked At           Expires At                        Reason
---- -------- -------------------- --------------------------------- -------
x509 aabbcc11 2025-02-20T11:44:13Z 2025-02-27T11:44:13Z (34m21s)     example
```

## Using `tctl` to remove a revocation

You can remove an existing revocation using the `tctl workload-identity
revocations rm` command:

```code
$ tctl workload-identity revocations rm --type x509 --serial aabbcc11
```

However, typically it is preferred to issue a new X509 SVID rather than
remove a revocation. This is because validators may cache revocations and this
may mean that the removal of the revocation will not be immediately effective.

## Using `tctl` to fetch the signed CRL

If you need to export the signed CRL to import it to a third-party service
(e.g. AWS Roles Anywhere), then you can use the
`tctl workload-identity revocations crl` command:

```code
$ tctl workload-identity revocations crl
2025-02-27T10:54:02.526Z INFO  Received CRL from server common/workload_identity_command.go:435

to which to write the file.
