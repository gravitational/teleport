description: Common use cases with Teleport Identity Governance
labels:
 - identity-governance
---

Teleport Identity Governance helps organizations strengthen security and compliance by centralizing 
how access is granted, monitored, and enforced across infrastructure and applications. 
The following use cases highlight practical ways to apply Teleport's governance features, from integrating 
with device and identity providers, monitoring risky access patterns, and extending controls into external services. 
Each scenario links to detailed guides so you can quickly put these capabilities into practice.

## Just-in-time Access Requests

Grant temporary access when it's needed.
Developers request elevated roles only for the specific task and duration required. 
Approvals are tracked in the audit log, and Teleport issues short-lived certificates 
so access automatically expires without manual cleanup.

## Just-in-time Access Request plugins

Manage requests via third-party tools.
Review and approve requests where your team already works, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Jira, ServiceNow, and more. 
Plugins enforce your reviewer policies, post status updates, and keep a complete, auditable trail.

## Access Lists

Grant auditable access by user group.
Define membership-based access with owners, eligibility rules, and time-boxed enrollment. 
Access Lists map groups to Teleport roles, require periodic reviews, and provide a clear record of who had access and why.

## Teleport Okta integration

Import and grant Okta access through Teleport.
Use Okta for SSO and group management, then map groups to Teleport roles for least-privilege access across infrastructure. 
Changes in Okta propagate to Teleport immediately, simplifying onboarding and deprovisioning.

## Device Trust

Enforce trusted registered device access.
Require users to log in from registered, healthy devices before Teleport issues credentials. 
Device identity and posture checks help block access from unknown or non-compliant laptops by policy.

## Session and Identity Locking

Lock compromised users and resources.
Instantly quarantine a user, device, or node to cut off access in an incident. Locks terminate active sessions, 
prevent new certificate issuance, and are fully scoped and time-limited for safe rollback.

## Access Monitoring

Monitor access patterns and detect risky behaviors.
Leverage audit events, session recordings, and Access Graph queries to see who can reach what, and who actually did. 
Export signals to your SIEM for alerting on unusual activity and continuous compliance.
