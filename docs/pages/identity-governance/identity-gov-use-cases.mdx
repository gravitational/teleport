labels:

Teleport Identity Governance helps organizations strengthen security and compliance by centralizing 
how access is granted, monitored, and enforced across infrastructure and applications. 
The following use cases highlight practical ways to apply Teleport's governance features, from integrating 
with device and identity providers, and extending controls into external services. 
Each scenario links to detailed guides so you can quickly put these capabilities into practice.

## Identity integrations

Teleport supports multiple identity options so you can plug into your existing stack or make Teleport your source of truth. 

Integrate with IdPs like **AWS IAM Identity Center**, **Okta,** **Microsoft Entra ID**, or **SailPoint** to sync groups to Teleport roles. 
If you prefer, you can also run **Teleport as an identity provider**, issuing 
short-lived credentials and federating access to downstream apps and services. 

These integrations enable centralized onboarding/off-boarding, group-to-role mapping, and consistent policy enforcement across all your resources.

- [**Okta Integration**](integrations/okta/okta.mdx)
- [**Entra ID Integration**](integrations/entra-id/getting-started.mdx)
- [**Teleport Identity Provider**](./idps/idps.mdx)
- [**SailPoint SCIM Integration**](integrations/scim/sailpoint.mdx)

## Just-in-time Access Requests

[Grant temporary access when it's needed](./access-requests/access-requests.mdx).
Developers request elevated roles only for the specific task and duration required. 
Approvals are tracked in the audit log, and Teleport issues short-lived certificates 
so access automatically expires without manual cleanup.

## Just-in-time Access Request plugins

[Manage requests via third-party tools](./access-request-plugins/access-request-plugins.mdx).
Plugins enforce your reviewer policies, post status updates, and keep a complete, auditable trail. 
You can receive Access Request notifications where your team already works, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Jira, ServiceNow, and more.

## Access Lists

[Grant auditable access by user group](./access-lists/access-lists.mdx).
Define membership-based access with owners, eligibility rules, and time-boxed enrollment. 
Access Lists map groups to Teleport roles, require periodic reviews, and provide a clear record of who had access and why.

## Device Trust

[Enforce trusted registered device access](./device-trust/device-trust.mdx).
Device identity can help block access from unknown or non-compliant workstations by policy.

## Session and Identity Locking

[Lock compromised users and resources](./locking.mdx).
Instantly quarantine a user, device, or node to cut off access in an incident. Locks terminate active sessions, 
prevent new certificate issuance, and are fully scoped and time-limited for safe rollback.
