With Teleport Resource Access Requests, users can request access to specific
resources without needing to know anything about the roles or RBAC controls used
under the hood.
The Access Request API makes it easy to dynamically approve or deny these
requests.

Just-in-time Access Requests are a feature of Teleport Enterprise.
Teleport Community Edition users can get a preview of how Access Requests work by
requesting a role via the Teleport CLI. Full Access Request functionality,
including Resource Access Requests and an intuitive and searchable UI are
available in Teleport Enterprise.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx edition="Teleport Enterprise"!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/6. Grant roles to users

The built-in `requester` and `reviewer` roles have permissions to, respectively,
open and review Access Requests. Grant the `requester` and `reviewer` roles to
existing users, or create new users to test this feature. Make sure the
requester has a valid `login` so that they can view and access SSH nodes.

For the rest of the guide we will assume that the `requester` role has been
granted to a user named `alice` and the `reviewer` role has been granted to a
user named `bob`.

1. Assign the `requester` role to a user named `alice`:

   (!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="requester" user="\`alice\`"!)

1. Repeat these steps to assign the `reviewer` role to a user named `bob`.

<Admonition type="tip">

Consider defining custom roles to limit the scope of a requester or reviewer's
permissions. Read the [Access Request
Configuration](./access-request-configuration.mdx) guide for available options.

</Admonition>

## Step 2/6. Search for resources

First, log in as `alice`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user alice
```

Notice that `tsh ls` returns an empty list, because `alice` does not have access to any resources by default.
```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address Labels
--------- ------- ------
```

Then try searching for all available ssh nodes.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738
bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f node        test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason <request reason>
```

You can search for resources of kind `node`, `kube_cluster`, `db`, `app`, and
`windows_desktop`. Teleport also supports searching and requesting access to
resources within Kubernetes clusters with kind `kube_resource`.

Advanced filters and queries are supported. See our
[filtering reference](../../reference/cli/cli.mdx) for more information.

Try narrowing your search to a specific resource you want to access.

```code
$ tsh request search --kind node --search iot
Name                                 Hostname    Labels       Resource ID
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 iot         test=test    /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/b1168402-9340-421a-a344-af66a6675738 \
    --reason <request reason>
```

## Step 3/6. Request access to a resource

Copy the command output by `tsh request search` in the previous step, optionally filling in a request reason.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"
Creating request...

Reviewers:  [none] (suggested)
Status:     PENDING

hint: use 'tsh login --request-id=<request-id>' to login with an approved request

Waiting for request approval...

```

The command will automatically wait until the request is approved.

## Step 4/6. Approve the Access Request

First, log in as `bob`.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy teleport.example.com --user bob
```

Then list, review, and approve the Access Request.

```code
$ tsh request ls

</Admonition>

## Step 5/6. Access the requested resource

`alice`'s `tsh request create` command should resolve now that the request has been approved.

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/node/bbb56211-7b54-4f9e-bee9-b68ea156be5f \
    --reason "responding to incident 123"

  Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

`alice` can now view and access the node.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name Address   Labels
--------- --------- ---------
iot       [::]:3022 test=test

$ tsh ssh alice@iot
iot:~ alice$
```

## Step 6/6. Resume regular access

While logged in with a Resource Access Request, users will be blocked from access to any other resources.
This is necessary because their certificate now contains an elevated role,
so it is restricted to only allow access to the resources they were specifically approved for.
Use the `tsh request drop` command to "drop" the request and resume regular access.

```code
$ tsh request drop
```

When you drop an Access Request, Teleport issues a new user certificate. The new
certificate retains the expiration of the previous certificate. Once your
session expires and you reauthenticate to Teleport, you receive a user
certificate with your user's originally configured time to live.

## Next Steps

### Automatically request access for SSH

Once you have configured Resource Access Requests,
`tsh ssh` is able to automatically create a Resource Access Request for you when access is denied,
allowing you to skip the `tsh request search` and `tsh request create` steps.

```code
$ tsh ssh alice@iot
ERROR: access denied to alice connecting to iot on cluster teleport.example.com

You do not currently have access to alice@iot, attempting to request access.

```

### Restrict the resources a user can request access to

In this guide, we showed you how to enable a user to search for resources to
request access to. To do so, we assigned the user a Teleport role with the
`search_as_roles` field set to the preset `access` role.

You can impose further restrictions on the resources a user is allowed to
search by assigning `search_as_roles` to a more limited role. Below, we will
show you which permissions you must set to restrict a user's ability to search
for different resources.

To restrict access to a particular resource using a role similar to the ones
below, edit one of the user's roles so the `search_as_roles` field includes the
role you have created.

For full details on how to use Teleport roles to configure RBAC, see the
[Access Controls Reference](../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).

#### `node`

You can restrict access to searching `node` resources by assigning values to the
`node_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields. The following
role allows access to SSH Service instances with the `env:staging` label.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: staging-access
spec:
  allow:
    node_labels:
      env: staging
    logins:
      - '{{internal.logins}}'
  options:
    # Only allows the requester to use this role for 1 hour from time of request.
    max_session_ttl: 1h
```

#### `kube_cluster`

You can restrict access to searching `kube_cluster` resources by assigning
values to the `kubernetes_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny`
fields.

The following role allows access to Kubernetes clusters with the `env:staging`
label:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v8
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      env: staging
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: '*'
        namespace: '*'
        name: '*'
        api_group: '*'
  deny: {}
```

#### Kubernetes resources

You can restrict access to Kubernetes resources by assigning values to the
`kubernetes_resources` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to Kubernetes pods with the name `nginx` in any
namespace, and all pods in the `dev` namespace:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-access
version: v8
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_resources:
      - kind: pods
        namespace: '*'
        name: 'nginx*'
        api_group: ''
      - kind: pods
        namespace: dev
        name: '*'
        api_group: ''
    kubernetes_groups:
      - viewers
  deny: {}
```

##### Restrict Access Requests to specific Kubernetes resource kinds

The `request.kubernetes_resources` field allows you to restrict what kinds of Kubernetes
resources a user can request access to. Configuring this field to any value will disallow
requesting access to the entire Kubernetes cluster.

If the `request.kubernetes_resources` field is not configured, then a user can request access
to any Kubernetes resources, including the entire Kubernetes cluster.

The following role allows users to request access to Kubernetes namespaces.
Requests for Kubernetes resources other than `pods` will not be allowed.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: requester-kube-access
version: v8
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - kube-access
      kubernetes_resources:
        - kind: pods
          api_group: ''
```

The following role allows users to request access only to Kubernetes deployments and/or pods.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: requester-kube-access
version: v8
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - kube-access
      kubernetes_resources:
        - kind: deployments
          api_group: apps
        - kind: pods
          api_group: ''
```

The following role allows users to request access to any specific Kubernetes resources.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: requester-kube-access
version: v8
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
        - kube-access
      kubernetes_resources:
        - kind: '*'
          api_group: '*'
```

The `request.kubernetes_resources` field only restricts what
`kind` / `api_group` of Kubernetes resource requests are allowed.
To control Kubernetes access to these resources see
[Kubernetes Resources](../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx)
section for more details.

#### `db`

You can restrict access to searching `db` resources by assigning values to the
`db_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to databases with the `env:dev` or
`env:staging` labels:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      env: ["dev", "staging"]

    # Database account names this role can connect as.
    db_users: ["viewer", "editor"]
    db_names: ["*"]
```

#### `app`

You can restrict access to searching `app` resources by assigning values to the
`app_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny` fields.

The following role allows access to all applications except for those in
`env:prod`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      "*": "*"
  deny:
    app_labels:
      env: "prod"
```

#### `windows_desktop`

You can restrict access to searching `windows_desktop` resources by assigning
values to the `windows_desktop_labels` field in the `spec.allow` or `spec.deny`
fields.

The following role allows access to all Windows desktops with the
`env:dev` or `env:staging` labels.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v4
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      env: ["dev", "staging"]

    windows_desktop_logins: ["{{internal.windows_logins}}"]
```

### Request access to Kubernetes resources

Teleport users can request access to a Kubernetes resources by running the following
command, where <Var name="resource-id" /> is the ID of the resource:

```code
$ tsh request create <Var name="resource-id" />
```

#### Namespace-scoped resources

For Kubernetes namespaced resources, the `resource-id` is in the following format:

```
/TELEPORT_CLUSTER/kube:ns:NAMESPACED_PLURAL_KIND[.API_GROUP]/KUBE_CLUSTER/NAMESPACE/RESOURCE_NAME
```

The `API_GROUP` part is only required for resources that are part of the core
Kubernetes group.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can run this command to list the namespaced Kubernetes resources,
including their API groups:

```code
$ kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true -o name --sort-by=name
```
</Admonition>

For example, to request access to a pod called `nginx-1` in the `dev`
namespace, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/kube:ns:pods/mycluster/dev/nginx-1
```

And to request access to a deployment called `website` in the `prod`
namespace, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/kube:ns:deployments.apps/mycluster/prod/website
```

For the `NAMESPACED_PLURAL_KIND` value you can use `*` to match all.
For the `API_GROUP`, `NAMESPACE` and `RESOURCE_NAME`
values, you can match ranges of characters by supplying a wildcard (`*`) or
regular expression. Regular expressions must begin with `^` and end with `$`.

For example, to create a request to access all pods in all namespaces that
match the regular expression `/^nginx-[a-z0-9-]+$/`, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resource '/teleport.example.com/kube:ns:pods/mycluster/*/^nginx-[a-z0-9-]+$'
```

#### Cluster-scoped resources

For Kubernetes cluster-scoped resources, the `resource-id` is in the following
format:

```
/TELEPORT_CLUSTER/kube:cw:CLUSTER_WIDE_PLURAL_KIND[.API_GROUP]/KUBE_CLUSTER/RESOURCE_NAME
```

The `API_GROUP` part is only required for resources that are part of the core
kubernetes group.

<Admonition type="tip">
You can run this command to list the cluster-wide Kubernetes resources,
including their API groups:

```code
$ kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false -o name --sort-by=name
```
</Admonition>

For example, to request access to a namespace called `prod`, run the
following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resource /teleport.example.com/kube:cw:namespaces/mycluster/prod
```

Note that this will only grant access to the namespace resource itself, not to
any namespaced resources within it.

For the `CLUSTER_WIDE_PLURAL_KIND` value you can use `*` to match all.
For the `API_GROUP` and `RESOURCE_NAME` value, you
can match ranges of characters by supplying a wildcard (`*`) or regular
expression. Regular expressions must begin with `^` and end with `$`.

For example, to create a request to access all namespaces prefixed with `dev` match
the regular expression `/^dev-[a-z0-9-]+$/`, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create --resource '/teleport.example.com/kube:cw:namespaces/mycluster/^dev-[a-z0-9-]+$'
```

Using cluster-scoped resource requests requires the role under `search_as_roles` to have the correct
permissions for the cluster-scoped resource.  This is an example of the required permissions to
request access only to the namespace `prod` (does not include any resources within it):

```yaml
kind: role
version: v8
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_resources:
    - kind: namespaces
      api_group: ''
      name: prod
      verbs:
      - '*'
```

#### Wildcard requests

You can request access to a namespace and all resources within it, as well as to all cluster-wide resources. To do so, you can use wildcards in the resource ID.

For cluster-wide resources, the `kind` format as described above is
`kube:cw:CLUSTER_WIDE_PLURAL_KIND[.API_GROUP]`.
To request access to all cluster-wide resources you can request access to
`kube:cw:*.*`. Where the first `*` represents the kind, and the second `*`
represents the `api group`.

For namespaced resources, the `kind` format is
`kube:ns:NAMESPACED_PLURAL_KIND[.API_GROUP]`.
To request access to all namespaced resources within a specific namespace, you
can request access to `kube:ns:*.*`, where the first `*` represents the kind,
and the second `*` represents the `api group`.

For example, to request access to the `prod` namespace (cluster-wide) all
resources within it (i.e., namespaced), you can run the following command:

```code
$ tsh request create \
  --resource /teleport.example.com/kube:cw:namespaces/mycluster/prod \
  --resource '/teleport.example.com/kube:ns:*.*/mycluster/prod/*'
```

Similarly, to request access to everything within a cluster, you can use the
following command:

```code
$ tsh request create \
  --resource '/teleport.example.com/kube:cw:*.*/mycluster/*' \
  --resource '/teleport.example.com/kube:ns:*.*/mycluster/*/*'
```

which is equivalent to:

```code
$ tsh request create \
  --resource /teleport.example.com/kube_cluster/mycluster
```

#### Search for Kubernetes resources

If a user has no access to a Kubernetes cluster, they can search the list of
resources in the cluster by running the following command, replacing
<Var name="kube-cluster" /> with the name of the Kubernetes cluster and
<Var name="namespace" /> with the name of a Kubernetes namespace:

```code
$ tsh request search \
    --kind=kube_resource --kube-kind=pods --kube-api-group='' \
    --kube-cluster=<Var name="kube-cluster" /> \
    [--kube-namespace=<Var name="namespace" />|--all-kube-namespaces]
Name               Namespace Labels    Resource ID
-----------------  --------- --------- ----------------------------------------------------------
nginx-deployment-0 default   app=nginx /teleport.example.com/kube:ns:pods/local/default/nginx-deployment-0
nginx-deployment-1 default   app=nginx /teleport.example.com/kube:ns:pods/local/default/nginx-deployment-1

To request access to these resources, run
> tsh request create \
    --resource /teleport.example.com/kube:ns:pods/local/default/nginx-deployment-0 \
    --resource /teleport.example.com/kube:ns:pods/local/default/nginx-deployment-1 \
    --reason <request reason>
```

The list returned includes the name of the resource, the namespace it is in if
applicable, its labels, and the resource ID.
Resources included in the list are those that match the `kubernetes_resources`
field in the user's `search_as_roles`. The user can then:

- Request access to the resources by running the command provided by the `tsh request
search` command.
- Edit the command to request access to a subset of the resources.
- Use a custom request with wildcards or regular expressions.

`tsh request search --kind=kube_resource --kube-kind=<kind>
--kube-api-group=<api_group>` works even if the user has no permissions to
interact with the desired Kubernetes cluster, but the user's `search_as_roles`
values must allow access to the cluster. If the user is unsure of the name of
the cluster, they can run the following command to search it:

```code
$ tsh request search --kind=kube_cluster
Name  Hostname Labels Resource ID
----- -------- ------ ----------------------------------------
local                 /teleport.example.com/kube_cluster/local

```

### Integrating with an external tool

With Teleport's Access Request plugins, users can manage Access Requests from
within your organization's existing messaging and project management solutions.
