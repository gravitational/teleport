description: Shows you how to configure Teleport roles to require an Access Request for any Teleport access at all.
---

You can configure Teleport users to authenticate with no standing privileges,
meaning that, by default, their roles do not allow them to access infrastructure
or manage resources in your Teleport cluster. Instead, when the user first signs
in to Teleport, they must describe their reason for requesting access and create
an Access Request. Teleport shows them a **Waiting Room** until they receive
approval.

This guide explains the options that allow you to configure Teleport users
without standing privileges.

## Configuration fields

You can configure Teleport users with no standing privileges by editing a user's
Teleport roles. 

The `options.request_access` field has three possible values:

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`optional`|The default. The user does not need to specify a reason when making a request. The user must initiate a request manually when they log in to Teleport.|
|`always`| When a user signs in to Teleport, their client automatically generates an Access Request for all roles available to the user, without providing a reason.|
|`reason`| When a user signs in to Teleport, their client automatically generates an Access Request for all roles available to the user. The user must provide a reason when authenticating.|

If a role includes the `reason` strategy, you can specify a prompt to instruct
the user to provide a reason when authenticating to Teleport. To do so, set the
`options.request_prompt` option in a role. For example, the following role
prompts the user with the text, "Please provide your ticket ID":

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: employee
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      roles:
        - 'dba'
  options:
    request_access: reason
    request_prompt: Please provide your ticket ID
```

## Access strategies

Each user can have a single **access strategy** when they authenticate to
Teleport. If at least one of the user's roles has the value `reason`, the user
must provide a reason for requesting access when they authenticate to Teleport,
and when they input the reason, Teleport creates an Access Request for them.

If none of the user's roles has the value `reason`, but at least one has the
value `always`, Teleport creates an Access Request for the user when they first
authenticate.

If the user has no roles with `options.request_access` set to `reason` or
`always`, the user must request access manually.

## The Waiting Room

When a user with an access strategy of `reason` or `always` signs in to the
Teleport Web UI, they navigate to the Waiting Room, where they wait for their
initial Access Request to receive a review.

Users with the `reason` strategy must first enter a reason for the request:

request reason](../../../../img/identity-governance/waiting1.png)

After the user enters the reason, or if the user has the `always` strategy, the
Web UI creates an Access Request for that user (marked as `PENDING`). The user
sees a status bar:

request reason](../../../../img/identity-governance/waiting2.png)

Once the request receives an `APPROVED` status, the user's Web UI session
refreshes and they can see the resources available to their new role.

Users authenticating with `tsh` have a similar experience: if their access
strategy is `reason`, they see a prompt to enter a reason. If it is `always`,
`tsh` creates an Access Request for them immediately.
