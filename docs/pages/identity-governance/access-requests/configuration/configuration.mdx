This guide explains the considerations you should make when configuring Teleport
Access Requests, which enable a Teleport user to obtain elevated permissions by
getting approval from one or more users in the same Teleport cluster.

Access Requests are configurable on a role-by-role basis. When a user
authenticates to Teleport, including through a single sign-on provider, the
Teleport Auth Service reconciles all of a user's roles to determine the Access
Request configuration for that user. Teleport then applies this configuration to
any Access Requests the user creates.
