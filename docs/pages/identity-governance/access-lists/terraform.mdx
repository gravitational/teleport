You can manage Access List and their members using Terraform. This guide will help you:

- Understand how to manage Access Lists with Terraform
- Understand the difference between Access Lists managed by Teleport vs Terraform
- Understand how to manage Access List members with Terraform


## How it works

We will create a simple organization structure represented with Access Lists using
Terraform. It will consist of:

- Access List representing a team
- Access List representing access to a resource (staging database)
- assigning the team access to the resource
- (optionally) assigning Okta and/or Entra ID group access to the resource

Access List management with Terraform is done using 2 Terraform resources:
`teleport_access_list` and `teleport_access_list_member`.

There are some nuances to members management. This is where concept of *Access List type* comes
into play. There are 2 key Access List types: *default* and *static*.

### Access List of default type

The default Access List has the `.spec.type` field unset, or set to null or an empty string. Those are
regular Access Lists, like those created in the web UI. And as a consequence:

- They require auditing. Even though `.spec.audit` is not required, to be specified in the
  Terraform resource, the default value will be set and those lists have to be periodically
  reviewed in the web UI.
- Their members can be only managed with with the web UI and `tctl`. The source of truth
  for these lists is Teleport so you cannot manage their members with Terraform.


### Access List of static type

Access List of type static, have `.spec.type` set to "static". They differ from the default Access Lists:

- They don't support audit. `.spec.audit` field can be set, but it's ignored by Teleport.
- Their members can be managed by Terraform.

For static Access Lists, the source of truth for the membership is external (provisioned by
Terraform) so audit is not supported. The members should be reviewed at source, which are the
Terraform data sources or manifests and this process has to be external to Teleport.


## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx edition="Teleport Enterprise (v18.2.0 or higher)"!)
- Teleport [Terraform provider set up with credentials](../../zero-trust-access/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx)


## Step 1/6. Create an Access List for a team

First let's define a role, because Access List validation requires a role to be specified. Because
this Access List represents a team and shouldn't grant any permissions on its own, let's create a
noop role for it:

```hcl
resource "teleport_role" "noop" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name = "noop"
  }
}
```

And a static Access Lists representing a dev team with some user members:

```hcl
resource "teleport_access_list" "developers" {
  depends_on = [ teleport_role.noop ] # roles can't be deleted if they are in use
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = "developers"
    }
  }
  spec = {
    type = "static" # type must be set to "static" to manage members with Terraform
    title       = "Developers"
    description = "Dev team."
    owners = [
      { name = "admin" },
    ]
    grants = {
      roles = ["noop"]
    }
  }
}

resource "teleport_access_list_member" "developers_alice" {
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = "alice" # Teleport user name
    }
  }
  spec = {
    access_list     = teleport_access_list.developers.id # assign to "Developers" Access List
    membership_kind = 1 # 1 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_USER", 2 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_LIST"
  }
}

resource "teleport_access_list_member" "developers_bob" {
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = "bob"
    }
  }
  spec = {
    access_list     = teleport_access_list.developers.id
    membership_kind = 1 # 1 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_USER", 2 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_LIST"
  }
}
```

Note that the Developers list is just a container for the users which belong to a single team in
the org. On its own it doesn't grant any permissions to its members, as it assigns only the "noop"
role, but it is possible to nest this list in another Access List to inherit the permissions. That
will be shown in the follow up step.


## Step 2/6. Create an Access Lists granting database access

Now let's create an Access List representing access:

```hcl
resource "teleport_role" "db_access_staging" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name = "db_access_staging"
  }
  spec = {
    allow = {
      db_users = ["viewer"]
      db_names = ["*"]
      db_labels = {
        env = "staging"
      }
    }
  }
}

resource "teleport_access_list" "db_access_staging" {
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = "db_access_staging"
    }
  }
  spec = {
    type = "static" # static, so members can be assigned with Terraform
    title       = "Staging DBs access"
    description = "Read-only access to staging databases"
    owners = [
      { name = "admin" },
    ]
    grants = {
      roles = [teleport_role.db_access_staging.id]
    }
  }
}
```


## Step 3/6. Give access to the team

Knowing that nested Access Lists inherit grants of the parent Access list, giving "Developers" team
"Staging DBs access" is now as simple as creating a nested Access List membership:

```hcl
resource "teleport_access_list_member" "db_access_staging_developers" {
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = teleport_access_list.developers.id
    }
  }
  spec = {
    access_list     = teleport_access_list.db_access_staging.id
    membership_kind = 2 # 1 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_USER", 2 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_LIST"
  }
}
```

Once "Developers" Access List is a member of "Staging DBs access" Access Lists, "Developers" list
inherits grants of the "Staging DBs access" and in effect developers are granted access to the
staging databases.


## Step 4/6. Give access to a team managed in the web UI

This step will show how Access Lists of the default type can be employed in the structure. As a
quick reminder, the default Access Lists are supposed to be managed with the web UI and they
require periodic reviews performed by the list owners. The default Access List members cannot be
manged with Terraform, but the lists themselves can be created/modified and imported to Terraform.

Let's create a default Access List representing another team "DB Administrators" reusing the "noop"
role created in the previous steps:

```hcl
resource "teleport_access_list" "dbas" {
  depends_on = [ teleport_role.noop ] # roles can't be deleted if they are in use
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = "dbas"
    }
  }
  spec = {
    # type is skipped, this is a regular Access List
    title       = "DBAs"
    description = "DB Administrators team."
    owners = [
      { name = "admin" },
    ]
    grants = {
      roles = ["noop"]
    }
    # audit settings can be skipped, the values below are the defaults
    audit = {
      recurrence = {
        frequency    = 6 # every 6 months
        day_of_month = 1 # first day of the month
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The new "DBAs" team members can be managed using the web UI. Teleport user `admin`, as the Access List
owner, will be automatically granted permissions to manage members of this list. `admin` will be
also required to review this list in the web UI every 6 months as defined in the *audit* section.
Because Access List members are separate resources in Teleport, modifying the members won't affect
the Teleport state for the `"teleport_access_list" "dbas"` resource.

Now, let's give "DBAs" the "Staging DBs access":

```hcl
resource "teleport_access_list_member" "db_access_staging_dbas" {
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = teleport_access_list.dbas.id
    }
  }
  spec = {
    access_list     = teleport_access_list.db_access_staging.id
    membership_kind = 2 # 1 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_USER", 2 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_LIST"
  }
}
```


## Step 5/6. (optional) Give access to a Okta group

The Okta integration allows [synchronizing Okta groups and apps](../okta/app-and-group-sync.mdx) as
Teleport Access Lists. 

To give permissions to the Okta group represented as an Access List in Teleport, navigate to the Okta
Access List in the web UI, and from its URL (e.g.
`https://example.teleport.sh/web/accesslists/00gt3c8z9ukePm5uF697`) copy the last path segment. In
this case `00gt3c8z9ukePm5uF697` - this is the name of the Okta Access List resource in Teleport.

Now to give the Okta group members "Staging DBs access" permissions, create the nested Access List
membership:

```hcl
resource "teleport_access_list_member" "db_access_staging_okta_group" {
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = "00gt3c8z9ukePm5uF697"
    }
  }
  spec = {
    access_list     = teleport_access_list.db_access_staging
    membership_kind = 2 # 1 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_USER", 2 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_LIST"
  }
}
```

## Step 6/6. (optional) Give access to an Entra ID group

Entra ID integration allows [synchronizing groups](../entra-id/entra-id.mdx) as
Teleport Access Lists. 

To give permissions to Entra ID group represented as Access List in Teleport navigate to the Entra
ID Access List in the web UI, and from its URL (e.g.
`https://example.teleport.sh/web/accesslists/b1a6a594-a4ac-51d1-a6f6-1746a413a79a`) copy the last
path segment. In this case `b1a6a594-a4ac-51d1-a6f6-1746a413a79a` - this is the name of the Entra
ID Access List resource in Teleport.

Now to give the Entra ID group members "Staging DBs access" permissions, create the nested Access
List membership:

```hcl
resource "teleport_access_list_member" "db_access_staging_entra_id_group" {
  header = {
    version = "v1"
    metadata = {
      name = "b1a6a594-a4ac-51d1-a6f6-1746a413a79a"
    }
  }
  spec = {
    access_list     = teleport_access_list.db_access_staging
    membership_kind = 2 # 1 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_USER", 2 for "MEMBERSHIP_KIND_LIST"
  }
}
```

## FAQ

### Can I import my existing Access List into Terraform and start managing its members with IaC?

This is usually not the case. Any Access List can be imported, but Access Lists created in the UI
are not static type, so their members can't be managed with Terraform. The same applies to Access
Lists created by an integration (e.g. [Okta](../okta/app-and-group-sync.mdx) or [Entra
ID](../entra-id/entra-id.mdx)). An existing static list created by another Terraform setup (with
a different state) could be imported and then its members can be managed by Terraform, but that's
rather a rare use-case.

The recommended solution is to create a static Access List managed with Terraform and make this
list a member of the existing Access List. That way the members of the static Access List managed
with Terraform will inherit the grants of the existing Access List.


## Next Steps

- Learn how [nested Access Lists](./nested-access-lists.mdx) grants inheritance work.
- Familiarize yourself with
  [teleport_access_list](../../reference/terraform-provider/resources/access_list.mdx) and
  [teleport_access_list_member](../../reference/terraform-provider/resources/access_list_member.mdx)
  Terraform resources.
