Access list owners can be automatically assigned as suggested reviewers to
resource-based access requests that include resources granted by their access
list. In this guide we will walk through an example and the configuration of
this use-case.

## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster with a connected resource e.g. an SSH node.
- Teleport user (`admin` in this guide) with an `editor` role to perform configuration.
- Teleport user (`alice` in this guide) acting as an access request reviewer.
- Teleport user (`bob` in this guide) acting as a low-privileged requester user.

## Step 1/5. Create roles

As an `admin` user, let's create 3 roles:

- Role that grants access to SSH nodes with a particular label
- Role that allows users to request access to SSH nodes with that label
- Role that allows users to review access requests for SSH nodes with that label

The `ssh-access` role allows access to SSH nodes with a label `env: prod`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v8
metadata:
  name: ssh-access
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    - ubuntu
    node_labels:
      'env': 'prod'
```

The `ssh-access-requester` role allows to request access to such SSH nodes:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v8
metadata:
  name: ssh-access-requester
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      search_as_roles:
      - ssh-access
```

The `ssh-access-reviewer` role allows to review such access requests:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v8
metadata:
  name: ssh-access-reviewer
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      roles:
      - ssh-access
      preview_as_roles:
      - ssh-access
```

## Step 2/5. Assign requester role

As an `admin` user, assign the `ssh-access-requester` role to `bob`.

![bob user roles](../../../img/identity-governance/access-lists/bob-user-roles.png)

This role will allow `bob` to issue access requests to SSH nodes with `env: prod`
labels.

## Step 3/5. Create access list

Now, as an `admin` user, let's create an access list that grants access to the
SSH nodes (via `ssh-access` member role grant) and allows its owners to review
requests to these SSH nodes (via `ssh-access-reviewer` owner role grant).

On the Identity Governance / Access Lists web UI page select "Create New Access
List" and create a new one with the following parameters:

- List name: `SSH Access`
- Permissions granted to list owners: `ssh-access-reviewer`
- Permissions granted to list members: `ssh-access`
- List owner: `alice`

![access list owners](../../../img/identity-governance/access-lists/ssh-access-list-owners.png)

You can fill out the rest of the parameters as desired.

## Step 4/5. Submit access request

Once you log into Teleport as `bob`, you should be able to see your SSH node(-s)
as requestable resources.

On the access request checkout dialog, you should see that `alice` has been
prepopulated as a suggested reviewer because she is an owner of the access
list that grants access to the requested SSH node.

![alice is suggested reviewer](../../../img/identity-governance/access-lists/bob-submit-request.png)

Submit the request.

## Step 5/5. Review access request

Once the request is submitted, log in as `alice` and go to the Identity Governance /
Access Requests page to see `bob`'s pending request and review it:

![alice is suggested reviewer](../../../img/identity-governance/access-lists/alice-review-request.png)

That's it! `alice` as an owner of the "SSH Access" list has successfully reviewed
`bob`'s request to an SSH node that's granted by her access list.
