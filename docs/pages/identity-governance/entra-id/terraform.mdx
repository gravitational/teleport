This guide shows you how to integrate Teleport with Microsoft Entra ID using Terraform and `tctl`.
You will configure the Entra ID side of the configuration using Terraform and install the Entra ID 
plugin in Teleport using `tctl`. 

For other supported configuration methods, see the following guides:
- [Getting Started with the Entra ID Integration](getting-started.mdx)
- [Configure the Entra ID Integration using Azure Portal](manual-installation.mdx)

If you are new to the Teleport Entra ID integration, start by reading [how the integration works](entra-id.mdx). 

## Prerequisites

- Teleport Identity Governance enabled for your Teleport cluster.
- Your user must have privileged administrator permissions in Microsoft Azure and Entra ID tenant.

## Step 1/3. Prepare Terraform

Clone the Teleport Entra ID integration example module, which is available in the Teleport Github 
[repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/master/examples/terraform/entra-id-integration).

The example provides a configurable Terraform module to set up Entra ID tenant with attributes that are 
required for the Teleport Entra ID integration. The module is based on the `azuread` [provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs).

The example expects an authenticated Azure CLI session available in your environment.
The `azuread` provider expects tenant-level access, so the Azure CLI must be authenticated using 
the `--allow-no-subscriptions` flag.
```
$ az login --allow-no-subscriptions
```

## Step 2/3. Configure and apply

The example Terraform module provides Entra ID configuration options are based on the 
Microsoft Graph API authentication method you wish to configure for the Teleport Entra ID integration. 

Teleport supports two types of Microsoft Graph API authentication methods:
Teleport as an OIDC IdP and system credentials. 

Setting up Teleport as an OIDC IdP option is the only supported method if you are using Teleport Cloud.
If you have a self-hosted Teleport Cluster, you must ensure that the Teleport Proxy Service is publicly accessible.

Alternatively, using system credentials setup is best suited if you have a self-hosted Teleport cluster 
or when the Teleport Proxy Service is not publicly accessible. You can learn more about the differences 
on these authentication methods on this [page](entra-id.mdx#choosing-the-microsoft-graph-api-authentication-method).

At minimum, the Terraform example expects the following input variables:
- `app_name`: Name of the enterprise application that will be created in Entra ID.
- `proxy_service_address`: Teleport Proxy Service host, e.g., `example.teleport.sh`.
- `certificate_expiry_date`: SAML assertion signing certificate expiry date. 
   E.g., `2026-05-01T01:02:03Z`. Note that an expired certificate will prevent users from 
   signing in to Teleport. If it expires, you will need to update this value in Terraform, 
   as well as in the SAML-based Teleport Auth Connector created for the Entra ID. 

<Tabs>
<TabItem default label="Teleport as an OIDC provider" name="entra-oidc">

Create `tfvars` with your inputs.

```bash
cat > variables.auto.tfvars << EOF
app_name                = "<Var name="Enterprise app name"/>"
proxy_service_address   = "<Var name="Teleport Proxy host"/>"
certificate_expiry_date = "<Var name="SAML certificate expiry"/>"
EOF
```

Applying this plan will perform the following actions:
- Create an enterprise application.
- Set up SAML SSO for Teleport.
- Grant Microsoft Graph API permissions necessary for the Teleport Entra ID integration.
- Setup Teleport as an OIDC-based federated credential provider. 

After you configure `tfvars`, apply the plan.
```bash
$ terraform plan 

$ terraform apply 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="System credential" name="entra-system-cred">

You need additional input variables to set up managed identity.
- `use_system_credentials`: Configures the Terraform module to plan for resources required 
   for the system credential setup. Value must be `true`.
- `graph_permission_ids`: Permission IDs of the Microsoft Graph API permissions required for the integration:
  - `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy`
  - `Group.Read.All`
  - `User.Read.All`
- `managed_id`:  Principal ID of the managed identity which is assigned to the Teleport Auth Service.

The simplest way to retrieve the permission IDs is to run the PowerShell script in your Azure Cloud Shell.
A working PowerShell script is provided below. 
<details>
<summary>PowerShell script</summary>

```powershell
Connect-AzureAD
# This is a service principal object representing Microsoft Graph in Azure AD with a specific app ID.
$GraphServicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -Filter "AppId eq '00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000'"
# These are Microsoft Graph API permissions required by the managed identity.
$permissions = @(
  "Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy"   # Permission to read application
  "Group.Read.All"     # Permission to read groups in the directory
  "User.Read.All"        # Permission to read users in the directory
)
# Filter and find the app roles in the Microsoft Graph service principal that matches with permissions.
# Only include roles where "AllowedMemberTypes" includes "Application" (suitable for managed identities).
$appRoles = $GraphServicePrincipal.AppRoles |
    Where-Object Value -in $permissions |
    Where-Object AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"
# Print ID of each of the three permissions.
foreach ($appRole in $appRoles) {
  "{0} : {1}" -f $appRole.Value, $appRole.Id 
}
```

</details>

Once you have the permission IDs and the principal ID of the managed identity ready,
create `tfvars` with your inputs.

```bash
cat > variables.auto.tfvars << EOF
app_name                = "<Var name="Enterprise app name"/>"
proxy_service_address   = "<Var name="Teleport Proxy host"/>"
certificate_expiry_date = "<Var name="SAML certificate expiry"/>"
use_system_credentials   = true
graph_permission_ids    = [<Var name="Permission IDs"/>]
managed_id              = "<Var name="Principal ID of the managed identity"/>"
EOF
```

Applying this plan will perform the following actions:
- Create an enterprise application.
- Set up SAML SSO for Teleport.
- Grant Microsoft Graph API permissions to the managed identity. Permissions 
  are based on the permission IDs which we configured above.

After you configure `tfvars`, apply the plan.
```bash
$ terraform plan 

$ terraform apply 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the changes are applied, the Terraform module will produce an application client ID and 
Entra ID tenant ID values as an output. You will need these values in the next step.

Entra ID is now configured with the required attributes needed for the Teleport Entra ID integration.

## Step 3/3. Install the Entra ID plugin

To complete the integration setup, install the Entra ID plugin in Teleport.
The plugin can be installed with the `tctl plugins install entraid` command.

<Tabs>
<TabItem default label="Teleport as an OIDC provider" name="entra-oidc">
```code
$ tctl plugins install entraid \
    --name entra-id-default \
    --auth-connector-name entra-id \
    --default-owner=<Var name="Access List Owner"/> \
    --no-access-graph \
    --manual-setup
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="System credential" name="entra-system-cred">
```code
$ tctl plugins install entraid \
    --name entra-id-default \
    --auth-connector-name entra-id \
    --default-owner=<Var name="Access List Owner"/> \
    --no-access-graph \
    --use-system-credentials \
    --manual-setup
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- `--name` flag specifies the resource name of the Entra ID plugin.
- `--auth-connector-name` flag specifies the name of the auth connector this integration will create.
- `--default-owner` flag specifies default owners for the Access Lists that will be created
in Teleport based on the groups imported from the Entra ID.
- `--no-access-graph` flag specifies Identity Security integration is to be skipped.
- `--use-system-credentials` flag specifies to use system credential configured using Managed Identity. Use this flag only 
if you with to set up system credential based authentication.
- `--manual-setup` flag specifies a manual Entra ID configuration is selected by the user.

`tctl` will then prompt for an Entra ID tenant ID and an application client ID of the enterprise 
application created by using Terraform in step 2.

After you enter these values, the installation command will create a SAML Auth Connector in Teleport, along with the 
plugin service that imports users and groups from Entra ID to Teleport.
