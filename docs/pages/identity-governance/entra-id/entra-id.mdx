The Entra ID integration enables the following features in Teleport:

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Configures Teleport authentication with Entra ID as an
   identity provider.
2. **User sync:** Periodic import of Entra ID users as Teleport users.
3. **Group sync:** Periodic import of Entra ID groups as Teleport
   Access Lists. 
4. **Integration with Teleport Identity Security (Optional):** Lets you analyze user access 
paths and policies from the Teleport Identity Security product. If enabled, Teleport imports 
enterprise applications as well. 

## How it works

To configure SSO, Teleport uses an Entra ID enterprise application where 
Teleport must be set up as an SAML service provider. 

To import users and groups from Entra ID, Teleport must be configured with 
a credential to authenticate with the Microsoft Graph API. 

### Choosing the Microsoft Graph API authentication method

Teleport supports two types of authentication mechanisms to authenticate with the
Microsoft Graph API: OIDC IdP and system credentials. 

#### Teleport as an OIDC Provider for Entra ID 

In this setup, Teleport is configured as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider 
for the Entra ID enterprise application. 
Teleport OIDC IdP then generates a short-lived credential for the Microsoft Graph API
client configured for Entra ID. Authorization is limited to the API permission 
configured in the Entra ID enterprise application. 

Direct bidirectional connectivity between Teleport and Entra ID is necessary for 
Entra ID to validate the OIDC tokens issued by Teleport.

For a Teleport cloud cluster, OIDC IdP based authentication is the only supported
authentication method. 

#### System credentials

Designed for air-gapped Teleport clusters that are not publicly accessible, this setup 
accommodates environments where Entra ID cannot validate OIDC tokens issued by Teleport. 

Instead, Teleport relies on API credentials available where the Teleport 
Auth Service is running.

### Choosing guided or manual Entra ID configuration method

In the guided Entra ID configuration process, Teleport generates a configuration 
script, which configures your Entra ID tenant with the properties that are required
for the Teleport Entra ID integration. 

If you want to have more control over the Entra ID configuration, a manual
Entra ID configuration may be suitable for you. In this case, you update the Entra ID
tenant with the properties that are required for Teleport Entra ID integration. 

The Web UI only supports guided Entra ID configuration with Teleport as OIDC IdP 
authentication method. `tctl` supports both the guided and manual Entra ID 
configuration methods, for both Teleport as OIDC IdP and system credential based setup.
