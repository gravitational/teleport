This guide will show you how to rotate the SCIM bearer token in Teleport using `tctl`. 

## How it works

Teleport provisions AWS users and groups into AWS IAM Identity Center via 
[SCIM](https://scim.org/). The Teleport SCIM client authenticates itself to AWS 
IAM Identity Center using a bearer token. By their nature bearer tokens need to be 
rotated occasionally to maintain security.

## Generating the token

You can generate the new SCIM bearer token by following the AWS IAM Identity Center
[Rotate an access token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/rotate-token.html)
user guide.

Be sure to capture the token value displayed at the end of the AWS token creation
flow, as AWS will not display it again.

## Rotating the token

<Admonition>
This functionality is only available in `tctl` and cannot yet be done in the Teleport UI.

```shell
$ tctl plugins rotate awsic ${TOKEN}
```

Once the SCIM token is updated Teleport will check to see if the actual token
value has changed. If so, Teleport will automatically restart the Identity Center
integration for it to pick up and use the new token.

## Disabling token validation

By default, `tctl` will validate that the supplied token can be used to successfully
authenticate with the configured SCIM service. If, for example, the target SCIM
is unavailable and you want to force the token rotation you can disable the token
validation with the `--no-validate-token` flag. 

```shell
$ tctl plugins rotate awsic --no-validate-token ${TOKEN}
```
