This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about Teleport Entra ID integration. 

## What resources are imported to Teleport?

Teleport imports users, user groups and its members from the Microsoft Entra ID 
directory.

If Teleport Identity Security integration is enabled, Teleport will import 
applications and policies as well. 

You can control which groups from Microsoft Entra ID gets imported to Teleport 
by configuring [group filters](advanced-options.mdx#group-filters). 

## How does it work with nested Access Lists?

If an Entra ID group is assigned as a member to another group, Teleport preserves this assignment 
as a nested Access List. 

However, note that Teleport does not support recursive groups where group A is a member of group B
and group B is also a member of group A.

## What permissions does Teleport need to authenticate with the Microsoft Graph API?

At minimum, Teleport needs read access to users, groups and the main enterprise application 
for which the integration is configured.
```code 
- Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
- Group.Read.All
- User.Read.All
```

If you enable the Identity Security integration, you will need a broader set of permissions.
```code
- Application.Read.All # instead of Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
- Directory.Read.All # instead of User.Read.All and Group.Read.All
- Policy.Read.All
```

By default, the guided configuration script sets up a broader scoped permission, which 
is required by the Identity Security product to perform policy and access path analysis.
