title: How to Contribute to Teleport Documentation
description: Follow this guide to learn how to contribute changes to Teleport documentation.
---

We encourage everyone with an interest in improving Teleport documentation 
to contribute content, submit issues, and suggest changes.
This guide describes the process for making changes to the documentation whether 
you are an internal or external contributor.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, verify that your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- You have a code editor, a GitHub account, and experience using command-line 
  programs, including `git` commands and command line options.

- You have Node.js, version 16.x or newer, installed. 
   Run `node --version` to check whether Node is installed.
   If you need to install or update Node, see 
   [Installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) 
   for instructions to download and install Node.js using a package manager.

- You have the `yarn` package manager installed.
   Run `yarn --version` to check whether `yarn` is installed. 
   If you need to install `yarn`, run the command `brew install yarn` or 
   `npm install --global yarn` to add it to your local system.

## Step 1/5. Set up your local environment

To set up a local environment for contributing to Teleport documentation:

1. Open a terminal shell on your computer.

1. Clone the `gravitational/docs` repository by running the following command:

    ```code
    $ git clone https://github.com/gravitational/docs --recurse-submodules
    ```

    This command clones the main branch for different versions of the documentation.

1. Change to the root of the `docs` directory:
    
    ```code
    $ cd docs
    ```

1. Update the documentation to the latest version from the master branch:
    
    ```code
    $ yarn git-update
    ```

1. Install dependencies:
    
    ```code
    $ yarn
    ```

## Step 2/5. Navigate to a specific version

Different versions of the documentation are organized into the `content` directory of the 
`gravitational/docs` repository. Each subdirectory of the `content` directory includes 
a `git` submodule for a different branch of `gravitational/teleport`.

To navigate to a specific version of the documentation:

1. View the versions of the documentation listed in the `content` directory by running the following command:
    
    ```code
    $ ls -l content
    ```
    
1. Change to the directory under `content` that contains the version of documentation you want to update.
    For example, navigate to the directory that corresponds to latest version of Teleport.

    ```code
    $ cd content/(=teleport.major_version=).x
    ```

1. Switch to the master branch by running the following command:
    
    ```code
    $ git switch master
    ```

    You can use a versioned branch if you want to update documentation for a specific previous version of Teleport.
    However, it most cases, you should use the `master` branch.

1. Create a new branch of `gravitational/teleport` for your changes by running a command similar to the following:

    ```code
    $ git switch -c my-branch
    ```

    You now have a branch for a specific version of the documentation content.
    Before making any changes, note how the content is organized so you know where to find the files 
    to update.
    
    Within the `content/*.*` directory in your branch, there's a `docs` subdirectory. 
    The `content/*.*/docs` subdirectory contains the files and folders used to produce a specific version 
    of the documentation. 
    
    The subdirectory includes the following:

    - The `img/` folder for images used inside the pages.
    - The `pages/` folder for the Markdown files that contain documentation content. 
      Every file in this folder is rendered as a page.
    - The `pages/includes` folder for content that's only rendered when it's included in the body of a page.
    - The `config.json` file for configuring version information.

    You're now ready to make changes in your own branch using the code editor of your choice.

## Step 3/5. Test changes locally

As you make changes to the content in your local branch, it's helpful to see how the changes will be 
rendered when the documentation is published.

You can use `yarn` to run a development server that detects changes to the documentation and displays 
them whenever you manually refresh the page in the browser.
You can also use `yarn` commands to check for errors and fix common issues.

To test changes in your local environment:

1. Change to the root of the `docs` directory by running the following command:
    
    ```code
    $ cd docs
    ```

1. Start the development server by running the following commands:
    
    ```code
    $ yarn dev
    ```

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the documentation using the URL `localhost:3000/docs`. 

1. Validate the Markdown syntax by running the following commends:

    ```code
    # Check your Markdown syntax
    $ yarn markdown-lint
    # markdown-lint, but also checks that external links work
    $ yarn markdown-lint-external-links
    ```

    For more information about using `yarn` commands to work with Teleport documentation, 
    see the [README](https://github.com/gravitational/docs).

## Step 4/5. Create a pull request

If you're an internal contributor with permission to access the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport), you can commit changes and push branches directly to the repository.
If you're an external contributor, you can commit changes to your private branch and push private branches to a fork of the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport).

### Internal contributors

If you work at Teleport:

1. Add files and commit changes to your local branch periodically with commands similar to the following:

    ```code
    $ git add <new-file-name>                      # Add a specific new file to be committed
    $ git add -A                                   # Add all changed files to the list of files to be committed
    $ git commit -am "Fix or feature description"  # Add and commit changes with a comment
    $ git commit -m                                # Commit changes already added
    ```

1. Push your branch to `gravitational/teleport` with a command similar to the following:
    
    ```code
    $ git push origin my-branch
    ```

1. Open the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport), select your branch as the branch to 
merge into main, then click **New pull request**.

### External contributors

If you are an external contributor, you must commit your changes to your branch and push your branch to a 
fork of the `gravitational/teleport` repository.

To push changes as an external contributor:

1. Verify that you have an SSH key pair and have stored your public key in GitHub.

1. Open the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport), click **Fork**, then select **Create a new fork**.

1. Verify the owner and repository name.

1. Click **Create fork**.
    
    Alternatively, you can create a fork from the command-line by running a command similar to the following:
    
    ```code
    $ git remote add fork ssh://git@github.com/my-user/teleport
    ```

    In this command, `my-user` represents your GitHub user name and `teleport` is the name of your Teleport repository fork.

1. Pull all of the changes from the remote repository into your local fork by running the following command:
    
    ```code
    $ git fetch origin
    ```

1. Push changes from your local branch to the remote fork of the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) 
by running a command similar to the following:
    
    ```code
    $ git push --set-upstream fork my-branch
    ```

1. Open the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport), select your branch as the branch to merge into main, 
then click **New pull request**.

    The continuous integration (CI) pipeline automatically assign reviewers to your pull request. 
    To ensure that your PR is merged, you should respond to reviewer feedback in a timely manner. 
    If you don't respond to reviewer feedback in a reasonable period of time, your pull request is likely to 
    be deemed inactive and closed automatically. 

1. Wait for the minimum required approvals, then merge your pull request as soon as possible.

## Step 5/5. Backport changes to earlier versions

Because the docs site is versioned, we want to ensure that any changes you make to
the most recent version of the documentation are reflected in all of the appropriate versions of
Teleport we currently support.

You can find our list of currently-supported versions in the [FAQ](../../faq.mdx#which-version-of-teleport-is-supported).

There are many ways to create a backport.
The following methods represent the most common ways to backport changes for Teleport documentation:

- By using GitHub labels (internal contributors)
- By using the make program (internal contributors)
- By selecting commit hashes manually (internal or external contributors)

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Use GitHub labels">

You must be an internal contributor to use the GitHub label process to backport changes.
This method fails for forks of the `gravitational/teleport` repository.

When you open a pull request, add labels of the format `backport/branch/v[0-9]+`
to backport your pull request to different versioned branches of the `gravitational/teleport` repository.

For example, to backport a change to v13 of the documentation, add the label `backport/branch/v13` to the pull request.

After you merge your pull request, the continuous integration pipeline creates a table
of links in the comments for the pull request.
You can then create an additional pull request for your each backport version you specified as a label.
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Use make">

You must be an internal contributor and have Go installed in your environment to use the 
`make backport` script to backport changes. This method fails for forks of the 
`gravitational/teleport` repository.

To use make:

1. Navigate to the root of your `gravitational/teleport` clone. 

1. Run the following command to assign the `PR` variable to the ID of your original GitHub pull request and
the `TO` variable to a comma-separated list of versioned branch names:

    ```code
    $ PR=0000 TO=branch/v10 make backport
    ```

    This `make backport` script automatically generates backport branches and opens pull requests for them.
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Select commits (internal)">

If the automatic backport methods fail and you're an internal contributor, you 
must backport changes manually by selecting specific commits.

The following example illustrates how to backport a change into Teleport, version 
11.x.x. 
In this example:

- Changes were made in the `my-branch` working branch, then committed and pushed to 
the remote branch.
- A pull request was created to merge the change from `my-branch` into `master`.
- A merge conflict prevented automatic backporting of the change.

To commit a change manually:

1. Open the closed pull request for the `my-branch` change that was successfully 
merged.

1. Click **Commits**, then copy the hash of the commit made to `my-branch`.

1. Run the following commands to create a branch for the commit being backported:

    ```code
    $ git switch branch/v11
    $ git pull
    $ git switch -c my-branch-backport-v11
    $ git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
    ```

1. Open the files that indicate there are merge conflicts and resolve all of the
conflicts.

1. Add the updated and saved files to the staged list of changes. For example:

    ```code
    $ git add docs/pages/core-concepts.mdx
    ```

    You can use `git status` to check whether there are additional merge conflicts.

1. Finish the cherry-pick operation by running the following command:
    
    ```code
    git cherry-pick --continue
    ```

1. Push the changes for the backport to the fork.

    ```code 
    $ git push --set-upstream origin my-branch-backport-v11
    ```

1. Create a pull request in the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) for your backport.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Select commits (external)">

If you're an external contributor, you must backport changes manually.

The following example illustrates how to backport a change into Teleport version 11.x.x. 
In this example:

- Changes were made in the `my-branch` branch and committed to a fork of the Teleport repository.
- A pull request was created to merge the change from `my-branch` into `origin/master` from the fork.

1. Copy the hash of the commit made to `my-branch`.

1. Run the following commands to create a branch for the commit being backported:

    ```code
    $ git switch branch/v11
    $ git pull
    $ git switch -c my-branch-backport-v11
    $ git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
    ```

1. Push the changes for the backport to the fork.

    ```code 
    $ git push --set-upstream fork my-branch-backport-v11
    ```

1. Create a pull request in the [Teleport repository](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) for your backport.
