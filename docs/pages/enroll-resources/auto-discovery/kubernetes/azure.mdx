title: Teleport AKS Auto-Discovery
description: Auto-Discovery of AKS clusters in Azure cloud.

AKS Auto-Discovery can automatically
discover any AKS cluster and enroll it in Teleport if its tags match the
configured labels.

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/step-description.mdx serviceName="Kubernetes" resourceDesc="cluster" resourceKind="kube_cluster" !)

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/same-host-tip.mdx serviceName="Kubernetes" resourceDesc="cluster" !)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An Azure identity with permissions to create and attach AD Groups.
- One or more AKS clusters running.
- Access to AKS clusters.
- A host to run the Teleport Discovery and Kubernetes services.

## Step 1/2. Set up Azure Identity with the required permissions

Depending on each cluster's authentication and authorization settings, Azure
uses a different way to configure the necessary permissions for Teleport to forward
requests to the server.

Check the authentication modes used on your clusters and choose one or more
permissions scenarios. In some configurations, Teleport has the ability to
automatically configure the access to the cluster if you include the necessary
permissions to do so.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Azure AD + Azure RBAC (recommended)" >

In this scenario, the Teleport's authentication happens through Active Directory,
and the permissions required to access the Kubernetes cluster are associated with
the roles assigned to its identity.

This mode allows you to grant permissions to multiple Kubernetes clusters without
requiring specific settings for each one of them.

To grant access to the AKS clusters running with this setting, create an AD role
with the following content and assign it to the identity that the Teleport process will use.

```json
  {
      "Name": "AKS Teleport Discovery",
      "Description": "Required permissions for Teleport auto-discovery.",
      "Actions": [
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action"
      ],
      "NotActions": [],
      "DataActions": [
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/groups/impersonate/action",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/users/impersonate/action",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/serviceaccounts/impersonate/action",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/pods/read",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/authorization.k8s.io/selfsubjectaccessreviews/write",
        "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/authorization.k8s.io/selfsubjectrulesreviews/write",
      ],
      "NotDataActions": [],
      "assignableScopes": [
          "/subscriptions/{subscription_id}"
      ]
  }
```

Replace the `{subscription_id}` with the desired Subscription ID or a wildcard if
you want to guarantee permissions on all subscriptions.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Azure AD + Kubernetes RBAC">

When using Azure AD authentication with Kubernetes RBAC mode, Azure is responsible
for user authentication using AD credentials, but permissions management is Kubernetes'
RBAC responsibility.

Therefore, for Teleport to work correctly, you must create the Kubernetes `ClusterRole`
and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources on each discovered cluster.
The `ClusterRoleBinding` must bind the `ClusterRole` to one of the AD groups
configured in the Teleport identity.

Teleport can automatically create the `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources
in the following cases:
- Teleport's AD identity has permissions that allow access to the static [cluster administrator credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/aks/managed-clusters/list-cluster-admin-credentials) (local accounts).
- Teleport's AD identity belongs to the cluster's administrator group.
- Teleport's AD identity has permissions to create `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` on the
cluster and permissions to execute [remote commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/aks/managed-clusters/run-command).

In either of the specified cases, Teleport will be able to create the `ClusterRole` and bind
it to the first AD group it belongs. To make this possible, associate the
following permissions with Teleport's identity.

    ```json
      {
          "Name": "AKS Teleport Discovery",
          "Description": "Required permissions for Teleport auto-discovery.",
          "Actions": [
            "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read",
            "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterAdminCredential/action",
            "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action",
            "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/runcommand/action",
            "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedclusters/commandResults/read"
          ],
          "NotActions": [],
          "DataActions": [],
          "NotDataActions": [],
          "assignableScopes": [
              "/subscriptions/{subscription_id}"
          ]
      }
    ```

In all other cases, you must manually set up the required access as described in the guide below.

<Details
title="Manual configuration of Teleport RBAC permissions"
opened={false}
>

Connect to every cluster to enroll with admin permissions and create the following resources
using `kubectl`.

### ClusterRole

Create the `ClusterRole` RBAC definition with the required permissions for Teleport
Kubernetes Service to forward requests to the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: teleport
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - users
  - groups
  - serviceaccounts
  verbs:
  - impersonate
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
- apiGroups:
  - "authorization.k8s.io"
  resources:
  - selfsubjectaccessreviews
  - selfsubjectrulesreviews
  verbs:
  - create
```

### ClusterRoleBinding

Link the previously created `ClusterRole` into the Teleport AD group id.

```yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: teleport
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: teleport
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: {azure_ad_group_id}
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Replace `{azure_ad_group_id}` with the appropriate Azure AD group id
associated with Teleport identity.

</Details>

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Local Accounts">
      In this case, Teleport will use the user credentials generated during the
      provisioning phase of the cluster.

    ```json
      {
          "Name": "AKS Teleport Discovery",
          "Description": "Required permissions for Teleport auto-discovery.",
          "Actions": [
            "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/read",
            "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/listClusterUserCredential/action",
          ],
          "NotActions": [],
          "DataActions": [],
          "NotDataActions": [],
          "assignableScopes": [
              "/subscriptions/{subscription_id}"
          ]
      }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/2. Configure Teleport to discover AKS clusters

Teleport AKS Auto-Discovery requires a valid auth token for the Discovery and
Kubernetes services to join the cluster. Generate one by running the following
command against your Teleport Auth Service and save it in `/tmp/token` on the
machine that will run Kubernetes Discovery:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery,kube
```

Enabling AKS Auto-Discovery requires that the `discovery_service.azure` section
include at least one entry and that `discovery_service.azure.types` include `aks`.
It also requires configuring the `kubernetes_service.resources.tags` to use the same
labels configured at `discovery_service.azure.tags` or a subset of them to make
the Kubernetes Service listen to the dynamic resources created by the Discovery
Service.

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/discovery-group.mdx!)

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "teleport.example.com:443"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  discovery_group: "aks-prod"
  azure:
  - types: ["aks"]
    regions: ["*"]
    subscriptions: ["*"]
    resource_groups: ["*"]
    tags:
      "env": "prod"
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "env": "prod" # Match Kubernetes Cluster labels specified earlier
```

Once you have added this configuration, start Teleport. AKS clusters matching the tags and regions
specified in the Azure section will be added to the Teleport cluster automatically.
