The Teleport Discovery Service automatically detects resources in your
infrastructure and enrolls them in your Teleport cluster. When you deploy
servers, databases, and Kubernetes clusters, Teleport enables secure access to
these resources with no further configuration. This lets you decouple the need
to protect your infrastructure resources from the work of deploying and managing
them.

The Discovery Service runs on [Teleport Agents](../agents/agents.mdx). It
periodically queries cloud provider APIs to list resources in your
infrastructure. It then reconciles these resources with Teleport resources
registered on the Auth Service backend.

Set up Teleport auto-discovery for resources in your infrastructure:
