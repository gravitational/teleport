description: How to configure Teleport to auto-discover AWS databases.
---

Teleport can be configured to discover AWS-hosted databases automatically and
register them with your Teleport cluster.

In this guide, we will show you how to set-up AWS database auto-discovery.

## How it works

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/step-description.mdx serviceName="Database" resourceDesc="database" resourceKind="db"!)

{/*
TODO(gavin): include the architecture diagram once we've made one for the
Discover web UI integration
*/}

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An AWS account with permissions to create and attach IAM policies.
- A host to run the Teleport Discovery Service.
- A host to run the Teleport Database Service.
- One or more databases hosted on AWS.

## Step 1/8. Install Teleport

Install Teleport on the host(s) that will run the Teleport Discovery Service and
Teleport Database Service.

The Database Service needs network connectivity to databases, whereas the
Discovery Service does not.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/8. Discovery Service IAM permissions

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx service="the Discovery Service"!)

### Grant AWS IAM permissions

Attach the following AWS IAM permissions to the Discovery Service AWS IAM
role:

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/aws-db-iam-policy-picker.mdx!)

## Step 3/8. Deploy the Discovery Service

### Create a Teleport config file

Create a `teleport.yaml` config file on the host that will run the Discovery
Service.
You can leave the `discovery_group` <Var name="aws-example"/> value as-is or
change it to something you find more descriptive.

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "<Var name="teleport.example.com:443"/>"
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: false
discovery_service:
  enabled: true
  discovery_group: "<Var name="aws-example"/>"
```

This config file enables the `discovery_service` and configures it to join
the Teleport cluster.
It also sets the Discovery Service's `discovery_group`.
We will configure the `discovery_group` <Var name="aws-example"/> dynamically
in a later step, so that we can control the Discovery Service's
configuration without restarting the Discovery Service.

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/discovery-group.mdx!)

### Generate a join token

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl-token.mdx serviceName="Discovery" tokenType="discovery" tokenFile="/tmp/token" !)

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/alternative-methods-join.mdx!)

### Start the Discovery Service

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Discovery Service"!)

## Step 4/8. Discovery group config

Create a file <Var name="aws-example-discovery-config.yaml"/> and save it on a
host where you can use `tctl`.

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/aws-db-discovery-config-picker.mdx!)

Create the `discovery_config`:

```code
$ tctl create <Var name="aws-example-discovery-config.yaml"/>
```

The Discovery Service we configured earlier is in the same `discovery_group`
as this `discovery_config` and will begin using the `discovery_config` to
discover AWS databases.
Once it discovers databases, the Discovery Service will register them as `db`
resources in your Teleport cluster.

<Notice type="info">
A Teleport `db` resource represents the specification of a database that a
Teleport Database Service can then use to provide access to the database.
When a Database Service instance matches the `db` resource via label selectors, it will
begin to heartbeat the database by regularly creating short-lived `db_server`
resources in your Teleport cluster.
Tools like `tsh db ls` and `tctl db ls` will only display `db_server` resources,
i.e. databases that a Database Service instance is providing access to.
</Notice>

## Step 5/8. List registered databases

Before we set-up the Database Service to provide access to discovered databases,
we should check that the Discovery Service is actually discovering databases.

You can list dynamically registered databases with `tctl`.
The Discovery Service adds the label `teleport.dev/origin: cloud` to every
database it registers with your Teleport cluster.

Verify that the Discovery Service has registered `db` resources for databases
that you expect it to have discovered:

```code
$ tctl get db
```

Or check for a specific database:

```code
$ tctl get db/<database-name>
```

Refer to
[Discovery Service troubleshooting](#discovery-service-troubleshooting)
if you do not see `db` resources corresponding to databases that you think
should be discovered.

<Details title="discovered database names">
Each discovered database's name will have additional identifying information
appended to it to ensure uniqueness.
That additional info may include:
- endpoint type (e.g. "reader" endpoint)
- matcher type
- AWS region
- AWS account ID.

For example, if an RDS Aurora database named "my-postgres" is discovered in
AWS account "123456789012" in region us-east-1, it would be named
"my-postgres-rds-aurora-us-east-1-123456789012" in Teleport.

A discovered database also has a shorter display name that consists of only the
AWS database name and the endpoint type, for example "my-postgres" or
"my-postgres-reader".
Either the full name or the display name can be used for `tctl` and `tsh`
commands, but if the display name is ambiguous, then you will have to use the
full name.

You can override the database name by applying the `TeleportDatabaseName` AWS
tag to the AWS database resource - this is used as the `db` name verbatim, i.e.
additional identifying information will not be appended to it.
</Details>

## Step 6/8. Database Service IAM permissions

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx service="the Database Service"!)

Create an AWS IAM role for the Database Service and attach the following
permissions:

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/aws-db-iam-policy-picker.mdx!)

## Step 7/8. Deploy the Database Service

### Configure database connectivity

Unlike the Discovery Service, the Database Service must have network
connectivity to databases to provide access to them for your Teleport cluster.
You will need to ensure that several network reachability requirements are met
for the Database Service:

1. The Database Service has a network route to database(s)
1. The Database Service has a network route to your Teleport cluster
1. The Database Service security group allows outbound traffic to database(s)
1. The Database Service security group allows outbound traffic to your Teleport
   cluster
1. The database(s) security group(s) allow inbound traffic from the Database
   Service

In the highly likely case that your databases are deployed in private subnets
with strict security group(s) attached to them, you will typically need to
deploy a Database Service instance in the same VPC, possibly in the same subnet(s), and
with a security group attached to it that the database(s) allow inbound traffic
from.
The Teleport Database Service will probably need a route to the public internet
via an AWS NAT gateway or internet gateway in order to reach your Teleport
cluster.

This is not an exhaustive list of network requirements or suggestions, as that
will depend on your specific networking setup.

### Create a Teleport config file

Create a `teleport.yaml` config file on the host that will run the Discovery
Service:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "<Var name="teleport.example.com:443"/>"
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: false
db_service:
  enabled: true
  resources:
    - labels:
        "account-id": "*"
        "region": "<Var name="us-east-1"/>"
        "teleport.dev/cloud": "AWS"
        "teleport.dev/origin": "cloud"
```

This config file enables the `db_service` and configures it to join the Teleport
cluster.
The section `db_service.resources` is a list of label selectors.
The Database Service will match `db` resources that have these labels and begin
to heartbeat the databases by regularly creating short-lived `db_server`
resources in your Teleport cluster.

In this case, it will match auto-discovered AWS databases in the
<Var name="us-east-1"/> region
from any AWS account (`"*"` is a wildcard and it can be used as a label key and/or value).
You can make it match more specific databases by adjusting the label selectors.

<Notice type="tip">
The AWS tags attached to AWS databases are imported as Teleport `db` labels
in addition to some other identifying metadata.
Refer to
[Database Labels Reference](../../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/labels.mdx)
for more information about available database labels.
</Notice>

### Generate a join token

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl-token.mdx serviceName="Database" tokenType="db" tokenFile="/tmp/token" !)

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/alternative-methods-join.mdx!)

### Start the Database Service

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Database Service"!)

## Step 8/8. List database servers

To confirm that the Database Service is proxying discovered databases, run
the following `tctl` command:

```code
## adjust these comma-separated filtering labels as needed
$ tctl db ls teleport.dev/origin=cloud,teleport.dev/cloud=AWS,region=<Var name="us-east-1"/>,account-id="*"
```

If you do not see the databases that you expected, then refer to
[Database Service troubleshooting](#database-service-troubleshooting) below.

<Notice type="note">
This guide shows you how to set-up AWS database auto-discovery with a Discovery
Service and Database Service, but does not cover database user provisioning.

Additional Teleport RBAC configuration and possibly IAM configuration may also
be required to connect to the discovered databases via Teleport.

Refer to the appropriate guide in
[Enroll AWS Databases](../../database-access/enroll-aws-databases/enroll-aws-databases.mdx)
for information about database user provisioning and configuration.
