Teleport can be configured to discover databases automatically and register
them with your Teleport cluster.

## Supported clouds

- [AWS](aws.mdx): Discovery for AWS databases.
- [Azure](../../database-access/enroll-azure-databases/enroll-azure-databases.mdx): Discovery for Azure databases.
{/* TODO(gavin): Add an Azure discovery guide and permission reference */}

## Architecture overview

Database auto-discovery consists of the following components:

1. One or more Teleport Discovery Service instances polling APIs to discover and
  register databases with your Teleport cluster.
1. One or more Teleport Database Service instances forwarding database
  connections to the discovered databases.

Both the Discovery Service and Database Service can be configured in the same Teleport
process or separate processes.
We recommend running them as separate processes to decouple database discovery
from database access.

## How the Discovery Service works

The Teleport Discovery Service is responsible for polling APIs for databases
that match its configured selectors.
When the Discovery Service matches a database, it will
[dynamically register the database](../../database-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx)
with your Teleport cluster.
The dynamic `db` resources it creates in your Teleport cluster will include
information such as:

- *Name*: Database name, with additional identifying information appended to it
          to avoid colliding with other `db` names in your Teleport cluster
- *Labels*
  - Imported database tags
  - Database location/region
  - Cloud account information, e.g. AWS Account ID / Azure Subscription ID
  - The type of database discovered corresponding to the matcher type, e.g.
    "rds", "redshift", etc.
- *Endpoint Info*: Connection endpoint the database can be reached at

<Notice type="tip">
You can override a discovered database's name by using a special tag attached
to the database in your cloud provider:
 - ***key***: `TeleportDatabaseName`
 - ***value***: desired name

The Discovery Service will check if the database metadata includes the tag and
use its value as the resource name in Teleport.
The name override will be used verbatim, i.e. additional metadata will not be
appended to it.
</Notice>

The Teleport Discovery Service only needs access to APIs that it can poll for
databases - it does not need network connectivity or permissions to connect to
any databases.

In addition to registering new databases, the Discovery Service also removes
— from Teleport's registry — the databases that have been deleted or that no
longer match the Discovery Service's configured selectors.

## Discovery Service configuration

Here's an example database discovery configuration for the Discovery Service:

```yaml
discovery_service:
    enabled: true
    discovery_group: "disc-group"
    # poll_interval is the cadence at which the discovery server will run each of its
    # discovery cycles. The default is 5m.
    poll_interval: 5m
    # Matchers for discovering AWS-hosted resources.
    aws:
      # AWS resource types to discover and register with your Teleport cluster.
      # Valid database discovery options are:
      # 'rds' - Amazon RDS and Aurora databases.
      # 'rdsproxy' - Amazon RDS Proxy databases.
      # 'redshift' - Amazon Redshift databases.
      # 'redshift-serverless' - Amazon Redshift Serverless databases.
      # 'elasticache' - Amazon ElastiCache Redis databases.
      # 'memorydb' - Amazon MemoryDB Redis databases.
      # 'opensearch' - Amazon OpenSearch Redis databases.
      # 'docdb' - Amazon DocumentDB databases.
    - types: ["rds"]
      # AWS regions to search for resources from
      regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1"]
      # Optional AWS resource tags to match when registering resources
      # Defaults to a wildcard selector that matches any resource: "*":"*"
      tags:
        "env": "prod"
      # Optional AWS role that the Discovery Service will assume to discover
      # and register AWS-hosted resources.
      assume_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/rds-discovery"
      # Optional AWS external ID that the Discovery Service will use to assume
      # a role in an external AWS account.
      external_id: "example-external-id"
```

The `discovery_service.aws[]` setting is a list of selectors for AWS resources.
This example configures the Teleport Discovery Service to poll AWS for Amazon
RDS databases in the us-east-1 and us-west-1 regions.
It will assume an AWS IAM role in the `123...` AWS account, which has
the permissions necessary for RDS database discovery.
Here's how it works in detail:

1. **Provider type:** The Discovery Service can discover resources
  hosted by different providers. Each provider type has its own configuration
  section.
  The Discovery Service will poll the provider API for resources based on a
  configured list of selectors for that provider.
  Each selector will be used by the Discovery Service when it polls the provider
  API.
  In this example, the provider configuration is for AWS.
1. **Permissions:** The Discovery Service will need access to credentials that
  it can use to authenticate itself to the provider API. If
  `discovery_service.aws[].assume_role_arn` is configured, then the Discovery
  Service will first assume that AWS IAM role before making further API calls
  for resource discovery. This means one Discovery Service can be used to
  discover resources across multiple AWS accounts by assuming an external role.
  It can also be useful to simplify IAM configuration - you can configure
  a Discovery Service to use a different role depending on the type of resources
  it needs to discover.
  In this example, the Discovery Service will assume the "rds-discovery" IAM role
  which, as the name implies, only has the permissions necessary for RDS
  database discovery.
1. **Selectors:**
  When a resource is found via a provider API, the Discovery Service will
  check the corresponding selector tags/labels to determine whether it should
  register that resource.
  If the selector matches, then the Discovery Service will dynamically register
  that resource with your Teleport cluster. For databases, that means it will
  create a `db` resource.
  In this example, the Discovery Service will poll for Amazon RDS databases in
  the us-east-1 and us-west-1 regions and register `db` resources in your
  Teleport cluster for any RDS databases that have the AWS tag "env: prod".

For more information about Discovery Service configuration, refer to
[one of the guides above](#supported-clouds) or the
[Discovery Service Config File Reference](../../../reference/config.mdx).

## How the Database Service works

The Teleport Database Service is responsible for monitoring
[dynamically registered](../../database-access/guides/dynamic-registration.mdx)
`db` resources in your Teleport cluster and acting as a connection proxy for the
databases they represent.

The Database Service must be configured with label selectors to match `db`
resources.
When a `db` resource is matched, the Database Service creates a `db_server`
heartbeat to signal to your Teleport cluster that it can provide access to the
database that the `db` resource represents.
The Database Service must have network connectivity to the database endpoint and
permissions to authenticate to the database.
The permissions it needs vary by database type, so refer to Teleport's
[database access guides](../../database-access/database-access.mdx)
for detailed permissions information.

## Database Service configuration

Here's an example configuration for the Database Service:

```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: true
  # Matchers for dynamic db resources created with the "tctl create" command or by database auto-discovery.
  resources:
    - labels:
        # These labels, among others, are added automatically by the Discovery
        # Service.
        # "cloud" origin indicates that a `db` resource was created for a
        # resource discovered in the cloud.
        "teleport.dev/origin": "cloud"
        # Cloud resources are also labeled to indicate which cloud provider
        # they came from.
        "teleport.dev/cloud": "AWS"
        # Specific to AWS. This is the AWS account ID.
        "account-id": "123456789012"
      aws:
        # This is an optional AWS role ARN to assume when forwarding connections
        # to AWS databases.
        # The Database Service's IAM identity must be allowed to assume this
        # role.
        assume_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/StagingDBAccess"
    - labels:
        "teleport.dev/origin": "cloud"
        "teleport.dev/cloud": "AWS"
        "account-id": "222222222222"
      aws:
        assume_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/ProdDBAccess"
        # External ID is an optional value that should be set when accessing
        # your AWS account from a third-party service (delegated access).
        external_id: "exampleID123"
```

The `db_service.resources[]` setting is a list of label selectors.
This example configures the Teleport Database Service to match AWS databases
discovered in two accounts: `123...` and `222...`.
For each account it will assume a different AWS IAM role.
Here's how it works in detail:

1. **Label matching:** The Database Service monitors `db` resources and the
  first label selector in `db_service.resources[].labels` that matches a `db`
  will be used. If no selector matches, then the `db` resource is ignored.
1. **Permissions:** The Database Service will assume the identity configured in
  the label selector that matched. If the selector does not specify an identity,
  then the Database Service will use its own identity.
1. **Connection:** The Database Service, acting as either its own identity or
  the identity it assumed, will retrieve credentials to authenticate to the
  database and use those credentials to act as a proxy for an authorized
  Teleport user.
