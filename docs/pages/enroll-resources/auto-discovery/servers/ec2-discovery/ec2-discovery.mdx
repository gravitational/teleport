This guide shows you how to configure Teleport to automatically enroll EC2
instances in your cluster.

## How it works

In the setup we describe in this guide, the Teleport Discovery Service connects
to Amazon EC2 and reconciles the servers enrolled on the Auth Service backend
with servers it lists from the EC2 API. If an EC2 instance matches a configured
label and is not enrolled in your cluster, the Discovery Service executes a
script on these discovered instances using AWS Systems Manager that installs
Teleport, starts it and joins the cluster using the [IAM join method](
../../../agents/aws-iam.mdx).

The Teleport Discovery Service uses an IAM invite token with a long time-to-live
(TTL), so that new instances can be discovered and added to the Teleport cluster
for the lifetime of the token.

## Choosing guided or manual EC2 auto-discovery configuration

In the guided EC2 auto-discovery configuration process, Teleport generates
its own policies and SSM documents for the Discovery Service to use.

If you want to have more control over the policies and SSM documents used,
manual configuration may be suitable for you.
