title: "Enroll Kubernetes Services as Teleport Applications"
description: "Teleport can automatically detect applications running in your Kubernetes clusters and register them with Teleport for secure access."
---

Teleport can automatically detect applications running in your Kubernetes
clusters and register them with your Teleport cluster. In this setup, users with
Kubernetes-hosted infrastructure can configure secure access to any new
applications they deploy with no need for manual intervention beyond the initial
setup step.

To enroll Kubernetes applications automatically, your Teleport cluster requires
the Teleport Discovery Service and Teleport Application Service. The Teleport
Discovery Service queries your Kubernetes clusters to detect running
applications, and registers these applications with your cluster. The Teleport
Application Service then detects the new application resources and proxies user
traffic to them.

- [Get started](./kubernetes-applications/get-started.mdx): Set up automatic
  application discovery with the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart.
- [Architecture](./kubernetes-applications/architecture.mdx): Learn how
  automatic application discovery works.
- [Reference](./kubernetes-applications/reference.mdx): Consult this guide
  for options and Kubernetes annotations you can use to configure automatic
  Kubernetes application discovery.
