This guide will explain how to use the **Azure join method** to configure
Teleport instances to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets
when they are running in an Azure Virtual Machine.

The Azure join method is available to any Teleport process running in an
Azure Virtual Machine. Support for joining a cluster with the Proxy Service
behind a layer 7 load balancer or reverse proxy is available in Teleport 13.0+.

For other methods of joining a Teleport process to a cluster, see [Joining
Teleport Services to a Cluster](agents.mdx).

## How it works

Under the hood, Teleport processes prove that they are running in your Azure
subscription by sending a signed attested data document and access token to the
Teleport Auth Service. The VM's identity must match an allow rule configured in
your Azure joining token.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An Azure Virtual Machine running Linux with the Teleport binary installed. The
  Virtual Machine must have a [Managed
  Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
  assigned to it.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Set up a Managed Identity

Every virtual machine hosting a Teleport process using the Azure method to join
your Teleport cluster needs a Managed Identity assigned to it.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Azure Portal">

To set up a Managed Identity:
1. Navigate to [Virtual machines view](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachines)
if you're hosting Teleport on an Azure VM,
or navigate to [Virtual machine scale sets view](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Compute%2FVirtualMachineScaleSets)
if you're hosting Teleport on an Azure VMSS.
2. Select the VM or VMSS hosting your Teleport Service.
3. In the right-side panel, click the **Security/Identity** tab.
4. Under the **Identity** section, select the **System assigned** tab.
5. Toggle the **Status** switch to **On**.
6. Click **Save**.

If you're using VMSS and it is configured with manual upgrade mode, you must
update the VM instances for the identity changes to take effect:
- Click the **Instances** tab in the right panel.
- Select the VM instances to update.
- Click **Restart**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Azure CLI">

To attach a system-assigned identity to a regular VM, run:

```code
$ az vm identity assign --resource-group <resource-group> --name <vm-name>
```

To attach a system-assigned identity to an Azure VMSS, run:

```code
$ az vmss identity assign --resource-group <resource-group> --name <vmss-name>
```

If you're using VMSS and it is configured with manual upgrade mode, you must
update the VM instances for the identity changes to take effect. Run the following
command to propagate the identity change:

```code
$ az vmss update-instances --resource-group <resource-group> --name <vmss-name> --instance-ids *
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/5. Create the Azure joining token

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your Azure
subscription and the resource group that your VM's identity must match.

(!docs/pages/includes/provision-token/azure-spec.mdx!)

The token name `azure-token` is just an example and can be any value you want to
use, as long as you use the same value for `join_params.token_name` in Step 3.

Run the following command to create the token:

```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 3/5 Install Teleport

Install Teleport on your Azure Linux VM.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 4/5. Configure your Teleport process

The Azure join method can be used for Teleport processes running the SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, Database, or Desktop Service.

Configure your Teleport process with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: azure` as shown in the following example config:

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: azure-token
    method: azure
    azure:
      # client_id is the client ID of a user-assigned managed identity.
      # Omit this value when using a system-assigned managed identity.
      client_id: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Step 5/5. Launch your Teleport process

Start Teleport on the Azure VM.

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

Confirm that your Teleport process is able to connect to and join your cluster.
You're all set!
