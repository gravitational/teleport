title: Joining Services via AWS EC2 Identity Document
description: Use the EC2 join method to add services to your Teleport cluster on AWS
---

This guide explains how to use the **EC2 join method** to configure Teleport
processes to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets when they a
re running in AWS.

The EC2 join method is only available in self-hosted Teleport deployments. There
are two other AWS join methods available depending on your use case:

1. The **IAM join method** is available to any Teleport process running anywhere
   with access to IAM credentials, such as an EC2 instance with an attached IAM
   role (see [documentation](aws-iam.mdx)). No specific permissions or IAM policy
   is required: an IAM role with no attached policies is sufficient. No IAM
   credentials are required on the Teleport Auth Service.
1. **Tokens not signed by AWS:** You can configure Teleport processes running on
   AWS to join a cluster via [Teleport join tokens](join-token.mdx) or, for
   Teleport processes running on Kubernetes, [signed ServiceAccount
   tokens](kubernetes.mdx). These approaches allow you to join a Teleport
   process to a cluster when you don't want to rely on AWS-specific APIs, e.g.,
   when adopting a cloud-agnostic approach.

## How it works

The EC2 join method is available to any Teleport process running on an EC2
instance. Only one Teleport process per EC2 instance may use the EC2 join
method. The process presents an [EC2 instance identity
document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html)
to the Teleport Auth Service. 

Meanwhile, the Teleport Auth Service has AWS IAM credentials with
`ec2:DescribeInstances` permissions in order to check that the identity document
belongs to a legitimate EC2 instance. No IAM credentials are required on the
Teleport processes joining the cluster.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/self-hosted-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- An AWS EC2 instance to host a Teleport process, with the Teleport binary
  installed. The host should not have an existing data dir (`/var/lib/teleport`
  by default). Remove the data directory if this instance has previously joined
  a Teleport cluster.

## Step 1/5. Set up AWS IAM credentials

The Teleport Auth Service needs permission to call `ec2:DescribeInstances` in order to check
that the EC2 instances attempting to join your cluster are legitimate and
currently running.

### Create the IAM policy

Create the following AWS IAM policy named `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` in
your account:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
	   {
		   "Effect": "Allow",
		   "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
		   "Resource": "*"
	   }
   ]
}
```

### Attach the IAM policy

If your Teleport Auth Service is running on an EC2 instance and already has an
attached "IAM role for Amazon EC2", add the above
`teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` to the existing role. If the instance
does not already have an attached role, create an IAM role with the above
policy and attach it to your EC2 instance running the Teleport Auth Service.

If you are running your Teleport Auth Service outside of AWS you can attach
the `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` directly to an IAM user which
Teleport will use to authenticate.

You can provide the IAM credentials to Teleport through a shared configuration
file or environment variables. See
[Specifying Credentials](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials)
for details.

## Step 2/5. Create the AWS joining token

Configure your Teleport Auth Service with a special dynamic token which will
allow services from your AWS account to join your Teleport cluster.

Under the hood, services will prove that they are running in your AWS account by
sending a signed EC2 Instance Identity Document which matches an allow rule
configured in your AWS joining token.

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your AWS
account and the AWS regions in which your EC2 instances will run.

(!docs/pages/includes/provision-token/ec2-spec.mdx!)

Run `tctl create token.yaml` to create the token.

## Step 3/5 Install Teleport

Install Teleport on your AWS EC2 Instance.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 4/5. Configure your services

The EC2 join method can be used for Teleport processes running the SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, Database, or Windows Desktop Services. The Teleport
process should be run directly on an AWS EC2 instance and must have network
access to the AWS EC2 IMDSv2 (enabled by default for most EC2 instances).

Configure your Teleport process with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: ec2` as shown in the following example config:

```
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: ec2-token
    method: ec2
  proxy_server: https://teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
```

## Step 5/5. Launch your Teleport process

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="IMPORTANT"
>

  The data directory (`/var/lib/teleport` by default) must be empty prior to
  launching the Teleport process. If this Teleport process had previously joined
  by another method (e.g.  token or IAM) the host UUID will not match the
  expected name (`<AWS Account number>-<instance id>`) and will not be allowed
  to join.

</Admonition>

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

Start Teleport on the host and confirm that it is able to connect to and join
your cluster. You're all set!

## Configuring the EC2 join method for Multiple AWS accounts

In order for Teleport processes to join from EC2 instances in AWS accounts other
than the account in which your Teleport Auth Service is running, Teleport must
have permissions to assume an IAM role in each of those accounts and call
`ec2:DescribeInstances` in the foreign account.

In each AWS account where your EC2 instances will be running:

1. Create the `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` from [Step 1.1](#create-the-iam-policy).

1. Create an IAM role `teleport-DescribeInstances-role` that can be assumed from
   the account where your Teleport Auth Service is running.

   Go to the AWS IAM Console, select Create Role, and for "Select type of
   trusted entity", select "Another AWS account" and enter the AWS Account ID of
   the account where your Teleport Auth Service is running.

1. Attach the `teleport-DescribeInstances-policy` to the role.

In the AWS account where your Teleport Auth Service is running:

1. Create an IAM policy named `teleport-AssumeRole-policy` with an `AssumeRole`
   statement for each foreign account:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::333333333333:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
        }
   ]
}
```

1. Attach this `teleport-AssumeRole-policy` to the IAM role your Teleport Auth
   Service has credentials for, see [Step 1.2](#attach-the-iam-policy).

When creating the AWS joining token, include an allow rule for each foreign
account and specify the AWS ARN for the foreign
`teleport-DescribeInstances-role`.

```yaml
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: ec2-multiaccount-token
spec:
  roles: [Node]
  aws_iid_ttl: 5m
  allow:
  - aws_account: "222222222222"
    aws_regions:
    - us-west-1
    - us-west-2
    aws_role: "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
  - aws_account: "333333333333"
    aws_regions:
    - us-west-1
    - us-west-2
    aws_role: "arn:aws:iam::333333333333:role/teleport-DescribeInstances-role"
```
