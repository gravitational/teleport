title: Joining Services via Kubernetes ServiceAccount Token
description: Use Kubernetes ServiceAccount tokens to join services running in the same Kubernetes cluster as the Auth Service.
---

This guide will explain how to use the **Kubernetes join method** to configure
Teleport services to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any
secrets when running in the same Kubernetes cluster as the Auth Service.

When a Teleport service wants to be part of the cluster, it needs to prove
its identity to the Teleport Auth Service before receiving its certificates.
Kubernetes issues signed proof to each pod describing which Kubernetes
ServiceAccount they can assume. When using the Kubernetes join
method, Teleport uses this Kubernetes proof to become part of the cluster.

<Notice type="warning">

The Kubernetes join method is not available in Teleport Enterprise Cloud as it requires the
joining service to run in the same Kubernetes cluster as the Auth Service.

</Notice>

The Kubernetes join method is available in self-hosted versions of Teleport.
It supports joining any Teleport service running in the same Kubernetes cluster
as the Auth Service.

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport cluster in Kubernetes. For details on how to set this up,
  see [Guides for running Teleport using Helm](../../../admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/helm-deployments/helm-deployments.mdx).
- Editor access to the Kubernetes cluster running the Teleport cluster.
  You must be able to create Namespaces and Deployments.
- A Teleport user with `access` role, or any other role that allows access to
  applications with the label `app: demo-app`
- Either the Teleport `editor` role or the ability to `kubectl exec` into your
  existing Teleport Auth Service pods.
- The Auth Service ServiceAccount must be granted the `system:auth-delegator`
  ClusterRole. Clusters deployed with the [`teleport-cluster` Helm
  chart](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-cluster.mdx) 
  have the correct role by default.

## Step 1/5. Create a Kubernetes join token

Configure your Teleport Auth Service with a join token (also called provision
token) to allow Teleport services hosted in the Kubernetes cluster to
join your Teleport cluster.

Under the hood, Teleport instances will prove to the Auth Service that
they are running in the same Kubernetes cluster by sending a signed ServiceAccount
token that matches an `allow` rule configured in your Kubernetes join token.

Create a file called `token.yaml` with the following content, which includes
an `allow` rule specifying the Kubernetes namespace and Kubernetes
ServiceAccount in which your Teleport services are running.

(!docs/pages/includes/provision-token/kubernetes-in-cluster-spec.mdx!)

Kubernetes join tokens can be used by any Teleport service besides the Auth Service, such as the Proxy Service and SSH Service. In this
guide, we restrict the token to joining an Application Service instance.

It is not recommended to use a single token that can join everything. You should
restrict the token to the roles used by the joining instance. For example, a Teleport
instance running both the Application Service and Database Service should use a token with
`roles: [App, Db]`.
Follow the instructions below to create the token depending on whether you have administrative access to the Auth Service pod:
<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Using tctl locally as your current user">

Create the token:

```code
$ tctl create token.yaml
```

Finally, validate the token was created:

```code
$ tctl get token/kubernetes-token

kind: token
metadata:
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  name: kubernetes-token
spec:
  join_method: kubernetes
  roles:
  - App
version: v2
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Using tctl on the Auth Service as an admin">
Retrieve the name and namespace of the Auth Service deployment:

```code
$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
cert-manager      Active   40d
default           Active   40d
kube-system       Active   40d
teleport          Active   40d

# We look for deployments in the "teleport" namespace
$ kubectl get deployments -n teleport
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
teleport-auth    2/2     2            2           6d20h
teleport-proxy   2/2     2            2           6d20h

# Here, the deployment name is "teleport-auth".
```

Then run the following command to execute the `tctl create` command from inside
one of the Auth Service pods:

```code
$ kubectl exec -i -n teleport deployment/teleport-auth -- tctl create < token.yaml
```

Finally, validate the token was successfully created:

```code
$ kubectl exec -i -n teleport deployment/teleport-auth tctl get token/kubernetes-token

kind: token
metadata:
  expires: "3000-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  name: kubernetes-token
spec:
  join_method: kubernetes
  roles:
  - App
version: v2
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/5. Deploy a demonstration HTTP app

In this step, we deploy a demonstration HTTP application and don't expose it
publicly. Instead, we will manage access to this application with the Teleport
Application Service, which we will register with Teleport using the Kubernetes
join method.

```code
$ kubectl create namespace demo-app
namespace/demo-app created

$ kubectl create deployment --image=nginx --namespace demo-app --port=80 demo-app
deployment.apps/demo-app created

$ kubectl expose deployment demo-app -n demo-app --port=80 --target-port=80 --selector='app=demo-app'
service/demo-app exposed
```

Validate the application pods are running and ready with the following command:

```code
$ kubectl get pods -n demo-app
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo-app-7664d59cb8-bv888   1/1     Running   0          67s
```

## Step 3/5. Configure the Application Service


Configure the `teleport-kube-agent` chart to deploy Teleport instances running
the Application Service by creating a `values.yaml` file with the
following content:

```yaml
# values.yaml

# Public address of the Teleport cluster with port.
# You must replace the placeholder with your proxy address.
proxyAddr: "teleport.example.com:443"

# Comma-separated list of services the `teleport-kube-agent` chart must run
# (supported values are: kube,db,app,discovery)
# In this guide we only deploy app access.
# Adding more services here also requires to add role to the provision token created in step 1.
roles: app

joinParams:
  method: "kubernetes"
  # this must match the provision token created in Step 1.
  tokenName: "kubernetes-token"
  
apps:
  - name: demo-app
    uri: "http://demo-app.demo-app.svc.cluster.local:80"
```

## Step 4/5. Deploy the Application Service

To use the token created in Step 1, the joining instance must run in the same
Kubernetes cluster as the Auth Service and have a Kubernetes ServiceAccount
token mounted.
The `teleport-kube-agent` chart that you will install in this section will take care of this by default.

Deploy the Teleport Application Service by running the following command:

```code
$ helm install teleport-app-service teleport/teleport-kube-agent -n teleport-agent --create-namespace -f values.yaml
```

Then, validate the pod is running after a couple of seconds:

```code
$ kubectl get pods -n teleport-agent
NAME                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
teleport-app-service-0   1/1     Running   0          23s
```

Finally, validate you can see the application in the Teleport Web UI, or using
the command line:

```code
$ tsh apps ls
Application Description Type Public Address       Labels              
----------- ----------- ---- -------------------- ------------------- 
demo-app                HTTP teleport.example.com teleport.dev/origin 
```

## Step 5/5. Clean up

Uninstall the `teleport-app-service` Helm release and delete both the `demo-app`
and `teleport-agent` namespaces.

```code
$ helm delete -n teleport-agent teleport-app-service
release "teleport-app-service" uninstalled

$ kubectl delete namespaces demo-app teleport-agent
namespace "demo-app" deleted
namespace "teleport-agent" deleted
```
