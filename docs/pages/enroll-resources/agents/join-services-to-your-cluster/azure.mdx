title: Joining Services via Azure Managed Identity
description: Use the Azure join method to join Teleport services to your Teleport cluster on Azure
---

This guide will explain how to use the **Azure join method** to configure
Teleport instances to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets
when they are running in an Azure Virtual Machine.

The Azure join method is available to any Teleport process running in an
Azure Virtual Machine. Support for joining a cluster with the Proxy Service
behind a layer 7 load balancer or reverse proxy is available in Teleport 13.0+.

For other methods of joining a Teleport process to a cluster, see [Joining
Teleport Services to a Cluster](join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx).

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An Azure Virtual Machine running Linux with the Teleport binary installed. The
  Virtual Machine must have a [Managed
  Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
  assigned to it with permission to read virtual machine info.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Set up a Managed Identity

Every virtual machine hosting a Teleport process using the Azure method to join
your Teleport cluster needs a Managed Identity assigned to it. The identity
requires the `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read` permission so Teleport can
look up the virtual machine. No other permissions are required.

(!docs/pages/includes/server-access/azure-join-managed-identity.mdx!)

## Step 2/5. Create the Azure joining token

Under the hood, Teleport processes will prove that they are running in your
Azure subscription by sending a signed attested data document and access token
to the Teleport Auth Service. The VM's identity must match an allow rule
configured in your Azure joining token.

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your Azure
subscription and the resource group that your VM's identity must match.

(!docs/pages/includes/provision-token/azure-spec.mdx!)

The token name `azure-token` is just an example and can be any value you want to
use, as long as you use the same value for `join_params.token_name` in Step 3.

Run the following command to create the token:

```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 3/5 Install Teleport

Install Teleport on your Azure Linux VM.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 4/5. Configure your Teleport process

The Azure join method can be used for Teleport processes running the SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, Database, or Desktop Service.

Configure your Teleport process with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: azure` as shown in the following example config:

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: azure-token
    method: azure
    azure:
      # client_id is the client ID of the managed identity created in Step 1.
      client_id: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```

## Step 5/5. Launch your Teleport process

Start Teleport on the Azure VM.

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

Confirm that your Teleport process is able to connect to and join your cluster.
You're all set!
