title: Joining Services via Azure Managed Identity
description: Use the Azure join method to join Teleport services to your Teleport cluster on Azure
---

This guide will explain how to use the **Azure join method** to configure
Teleport instances to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets
when they are running in an Azure Virtual Machine.

The Azure join method is available in Teleport 12.1+. It is available to any
Teleport process running in an Azure Virtual Machine. Support for joining a
cluster with the Proxy Service behind a layer 7 load balancer or reverse proxy
is available in Teleport 13.0+.

For other methods of joining a Teleport process to a cluster, see [Joining
Teleport Services to a Cluster](../join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx).

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An Azure Virtual Machine running Linux with the Teleport binary installed. The
  Virtual Machine must have a [Managed
  Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)
  assigned to it with permission to read virtual machine info.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Set up a Managed Identity

Every virtual machine hosting a Teleport process using the Azure method to join
your Teleport cluster needs a Managed Identity assigned to it. The identity
requires the `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read` permission so Teleport can
look up the virtual machine. No other permissions are required.

(!docs/pages/includes/server-access/azure-join-managed-identity.mdx!)

## Step 2/4. Create the Azure joining token

Under the hood, Teleport processes will prove that they are running in your
Azure subscription by sending a signed attested data document and access token
to the Teleport Auth Service. The VM's identity must match an allow rule
configured in your Azure joining token.

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your Azure
subscription and the resource group that your VM's identity must match.

(!docs/pages/includes/provision-token/azure-spec.mdx!)

The token name `azure-token` is just an example and can be any value you want to
use, as long as you use the same value for `join_params.token_name` in Step 3.

Run the following command to create the token:

```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 3/4. Configure your Teleport process

The Azure join method can be used for Teleport processes running the SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, Database, or Desktop Service.

Configure your Teleport process with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: azure` as shown in the following example config:

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: azure-token
    method: azure
    azure:
      # client_id is the client ID of the managed identity created in Step 1.
      client_id: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```

## Step 4/4. Launch your Teleport process

Start Teleport on the Azure VM.

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

Confirm that your Teleport process is able to connect to and join your cluster.
You're all set!
