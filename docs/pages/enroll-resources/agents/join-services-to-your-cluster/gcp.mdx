title: Join Services with GCP
description: Use the GCP join method to add services to your Teleport cluster.
---

This guide will explain how to use the **GCP join method** to configure Teleport
processes to join your Teleport cluster without sharing any secrets when they
are running in a GCP VM.

The GCP join method is available to any Teleport process running on a GCP VM.
The VM must have a
[service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances)
assigned to it (the default service account is fine). No IAM roles are required
on the Teleport process joining the cluster.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A GCP VM to host a Teleport service, with a service account assigned to it
  and with the Teleport binary installed.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Create the GCP joining token

Configure your Teleport Auth Service with a special dynamic token which will
allow services from your GCP projects to join your Teleport cluster.

Under the hood, services will prove that they are running in your GCP project
by sending a signed ID token which matches an allow rule configured in your GCP
joining token.

Create the following `token.yaml` file with a `gcp.allow` rule specifying your GCP
project ID(s), service account(s), and location(s) in which your GCP instances
will run:

(!docs/pages/includes/provision-token/gcp-spec.mdx!)

Run the following command to create the token:

```code
$ tctl create token.yaml
```

## Step 2/3. Configure your services

The GCP join method can be used for Teleport processes running the SSH (`Node`), Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, Database, or Windows Desktop Services. The Teleport
process should be run directly on a GCP VM.

Configure your Teleport process with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 1
and `method: gcp` as shown in the following example config:

```yaml
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: gcp-token
    method: gcp
  proxy_server: https://teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```

## Step 3/3. Launch your Teleport process

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

Once you have started Teleport, confirm that your service is able to connect to
and join your cluster.
