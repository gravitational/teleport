title: Protect Infrastructure with Teleport
description: Deploy Agents to enroll resources in your infrastructure with Teleport. You can run multiple Teleport services per Agent.
---

You can use Teleport to protect infrastructure resources like servers and
databases by deploying **Teleport Agents**. 

Teleport Agents are Teleport instances that are configured to proxy traffic to
resources in your infrastructure, such as servers, databases, and Kubernetes
clusters. 

This section shows you how to use Teleport Agents to enable secure access to
your infrastructure.

## Enroll infrastructure resources

To protect infrastructure resources with Teleport, you deploy Teleport Agents
and configure them to proxy traffic to and from the resources.

We recommend getting started with [Teleport
Auto-Discovery](../auto-discovery/auto-discovery.mdx), in which the Teleport
Discovery Service registers infrastructure resources with your cluster by
polling service discovery endpoints. For information on enrolling a specific
type of infrastructure resource, read the following sections of the
documentation:

- [Servers](../server-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Databases](../database-access/database-access.mdx)
- [Kubernetes clusters](../kubernetes-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Windows desktops](../desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
- [Applications](../application-access/introduction.mdx)

## Architecture overview

This section provides a brief outline of how Teleport Agents run in a Teleport
cluster. For more information on the architecture of Teleport Agents, read
[Teleport Agent Architecture](../../reference/architecture/agents.mdx).

### Services

Each Teleport process can run one or more **services**. A Teleport instance runs
a service if it is enabled within the instance's configuration file. See the
[Teleport Configuration
Reference](../../reference/config.mdx#enabling-teleport-services) for which
services are enabled by default and how to enable a particular service.

### Agent pools

Agents typically run in the same private networks as the resources they proxy.
They should be the only clients that can access a resource without Teleport.

In this setup, Agents dial the Teleport Proxy Service in order to establish
reverse SSH tunnels. While the Proxy Service remains open to the public internet
via its HTTPS port, Agents require only outbound network access to the Proxy
Service, and can run behind a firewall.

The Teleport Proxy Service uses these reverse tunnels to forward traffic in
Teleport's supported protocols to an available Agent. Agents apply RBAC
rules and forward the traffic to resources in your infrastructure.

Read our guide for how to use Terraform to [deploy a pool of
Agents](../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-starter/enroll-resources.mdx). 

## Joining Agents

Teleport Agents run one or more services, such as the Teleport SSH Service and
Teleport Database Service. To establish trust between an Agent and your Teleport
cluster, you use one of several **join methods**. When joining an Agent, you can
configure the services that run on the agent. You can also edit the
configuration of an Agent to change the services that run on it.

### Initially joining a cluster

Teleport Agents need to establish trust with the Teleport Auth Service in order
to join a cluster. There are several ways to join an Agent to your Teleport
cluster, making it possible to automate the join process for your environment.
Read about the available join methods in our [Join Services to your
Cluster](join-services-to-your-cluster/join-services-to-your-cluster.mdx) guides.

When a Teleport process first runs, it checks its configuration file to
determine which services are enabled. Each service then connects separately to
the Teleport Auth Service, which checks whether it has created a **join token**
for that service. If so, the Auth Service issues the Agent credentials signed
for that service. 

### Joining a new service on an existing Agent

The credentials that the Auth Service issues to Agents are signed for specific
services. To run new services on an Agent, you must repeat the initial join
procedure for those services.

Generate a new join token for all services running on an Agent, including the
new services. Then make the new join token available to the Agent. The method to
use depends on the value of either `teleport.join_params` or
`teleport.auth_token` in the Agent's configuration file:

- If the value of the configuration field is a token, update the token.
- If the value is a file path, edit the file at that path to refer to the new
  token.

Delete the Agent's state directory, which is `/var/lib/teleport` by default.
(Check the `teleport.data_dir` field of the Agent's configuration file.) With no
data directory, the Agent will obtain its initial credentials from the Auth
Service instead of reading existing credentials.

Finally, restart the Agent.

We recommend deploying Teleport Agents via infrastructure-as-code approaches,
e.g., [using a Terraform module](../../admin-guides/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-starter/enroll-resources.mdx). To modify the
services that an Agent runs, you can edit the configuration of your Agents
within your infrastructure-as-code project, then redeploy the Agents.
