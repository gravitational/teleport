title: Getting Started with Workload Identity
description: Getting started with Teleport Workload Identity for SPIFFE and Machine ID
---

Teleport's Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities intended
for workloads. It is compatible with the industry-standard SPIFFE specification
meaning that it can be used in place of other SPIFFE compatible identity
providers.

In this guide, you'll configure the RBAC necessary to allow a Bot to issue
SPIFFE SVIDs and then configure `tbot` to expose a SPIFFE Workload API endpoint.
You can then connect your workloads to this endpoint to receive SPIFFE SVIDs.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
  workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
  information, see the [deployment guides](../machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx).

## Step 1/4. Configure RBAC

First, Teleport must be configured to allow the Bot to issue SPIFFE SVIDs.
This is done by configuring a role to allow the issuance of SPIFFE SVIDs and
then granting this role to the Bot.

Before proceeding, you'll want to determine the SPIFFE ID path that your
workload will use. In our example, we'll use `/svc/foo`. We provide more
guidance on choosing a SPIFFE ID structure in the
[Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx) guide.

Create a new file named `spiffe-issuer-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: spiffe-issuer
spec:
  allow:
    spiffe:
    - path: "/svc/foo"
```

Replace:

- `spiffe-issuer` with a name that describes your use-case.
- `/svc/foo` with the SPIFFE ID path you have decided on issuing.

Use `tctl create -f ./spiffe-issuer-role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example-bot`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and `spiffe-issuer`
with the name of the role you just created:

```code
$ tctl bots update example-bot --add-roles spiffe-issuer
```

## Step 2/4. Configure `spiffe-workload-api` service in `tbot`

To set up a SPIFFE Workload API endpoint with `tbot`, we configure an instance
of the `spiffe-workload-api` service.

First, determine where you wish this socket to be created. In our example,
we'll use `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock`. You may wish to choose a directory
that is only accessible by the processes that will need to connect to the
Workload API.

Modify your `tbot` configuration file to include the `spiffe-workload-api`
service:

```yaml
services:
- type: spiffe-workload-api
  listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
  svids:
  - path: /svc/foo
    hint: my-hint
```

Replace:

- `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path to the socket you wish to create.
- `/svc/foo` with the SPIFFE ID path you have decided on issuing.
- `my-hint` with a hint that will be included with the SVID. This can help
  workloads identify which SVID they should select if multiple are presented.
  This field can be omitted if not required.

Start or restart your `tbot` instance to apply the new configuration

### Configuring DNS and IP SANs

In some cases, you may wish to configure DNS and IP SANs which should be
included in the SVIDs issued by the Workload API. This is useful in cases
where the client may not be SPIFFE aware and will check the DNS SAN rather than
the SPIFFE URI during the TLS handshake.

These can be configured in the `spiffe-workload-api` service using the `sans`
configuration block:

```yaml
services:
- type: spiffe-workload-api
  listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
  svids:
  - path: /svc/foo
    hint: my-hint
    sans:
      dns:
      - example.com
      ip:
      - 10.0.0.1
```

You will also need to modify the role to explicitly grant the Bot permission to
request an SVID including a DNS or IP SAN. For example:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: spiffe-issuer
spec:
  allow:
    spiffe:
    - path: "/svc/foo"
      # Replace with the DNS SANs that you wish your Bot to be able to include
      # in SVIDs.
      dns_sans: ["example.com"]
      # Replace with the IP SANs that you wish your Bot to be able to include
      # in SVIDs. You can remove this if you do not wish to include IP SANs.
      # IPs must be specified using CIDR notation, which allows you to specify
      # a single IP or a range of IPs.
      ip_sans: ["10.0.0.1/32"]
```

### Configuring Unix Workload Attestation

By default, an SVID listed under the Workload API service will be issued to any
workload that connects to the Workload API. You may wish to restrict which SVIDs
are issued based on certain characteristics of the workload. This is known as
Workload Attestation.

When using the Unix listener, `tbot` supports workload attestation based on
three characteristics of the workload process:

- `uid`: The UID of the user that the workload process is running as.
- `gid`: The primary GID of the user that the workload process is running as.
- `pid`: The PID of the workload process.

To configure Workload Attestation, you configure a set of rules for each SVID.
Each rule is a list of characteristics, and all characteristics within the rule
must match for that rule to pass. If you have multiple rules, any one rule can
pass for the SVID to be issued.

For example, to configure an SVID to be issued only to workloads that are
running as the user with ID 1000 or running as a user with a primary group ID
of 50:

```yaml
services:
- type: spiffe-workload-api
  listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
  svids:
  - path: /svc/foo
    hint: my-hint
    rules:
      - uid: 1000
      - gid: 50
```

## Step 3/4. Testing the Workload API with `tbot spiffe-inspect`

The `tbot` binary includes a `spiffe-inspect` command that can be used to
test the configuration of the Workload API. This command will connect to the
Workload API and request SVIDs, whilst providing debug information.

Before configuring your workload to use the Workload API, we recommend using
this command to ensure that the Workload API is behaving as expected.

Use the `spiffe-inspect` command with `--path` to specify the path to the
Workload API socket, replacing `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path you
configured in the previous step:

```code
$ tbot spiffe-inspect --path unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
INFO [TBOT]      Inspecting SPIFFE Workload API Endpoint unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock tbot/spiffe.go:31
INFO [TBOT]      Received X.509 SVID context from Workload API bundles_count:1 svids_count:1 tbot/spiffe.go:46
SVIDS
- spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/foo
  - Hint: my-hint
  - Expiry: 2024-03-20 10:55:52 +0000 UTC
Trust Bundles
- example.teleport.sh
```

## Step 4/4. Configuring your workload to use the Workload API

Now that you know that the Workload API is behaving as expected, you can
configure your workload to use it. The exact steps will depend on the workload.

In cases where you have used the SPIFFE SDKs, you can configure the
`SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` environment variable to point to the socket created by
`tbot`.

See the [Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx) guide for more information on
integrating SPIFFE with your workloads.
