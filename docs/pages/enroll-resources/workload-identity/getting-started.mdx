title: Getting Started with Workload Identity
description: Getting started with Teleport Workload Identity for SPIFFE and Machine ID
---

Teleport's Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities intended
for workloads. It is compatible with the industry-standard SPIFFE specification
meaning that it can be used in place of other SPIFFE compatible identity
providers.

In this guide, you'll configure the RBAC necessary to allow a Bot to issue
workload identity credentials and then configure `tbot` to expose a SPIFFE
Workload API endpoint. You can then connect your workloads to this endpoint to
receive SPIFFE SVID-compatible workload identity credentials.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
  workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
  information, see the [deployment guides](../machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx).

## Step 1/4. Configure Workload Identity

First, you will need to create a Workload Identity resource.

This resource is the primary way that Teleport Workload Identity is configured.
Each Workload Identity resource represents the configuration of an identity for a
specific workload or a template to be used when representing the identity of a
group of workloads. The Workload Identity resource specifies a number of key
things, including:

- The name of the Workload Identity, which will be needed when issuing it.
- The SPIFFE ID that will be included in credentials issued for this
  WorkloadIdentity.
- Any rules around when this Workload Identity can be used to issue credentials.

Before proceeding, you'll want to determine the SPIFFE ID path that your
workload will use. In our example, we'll use `/svc/foo`. We provide more
guidance on choosing a SPIFFE ID structure in the
[Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx) guide.

Create a new file called `workload-identity.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: /svc/foo
```

Replace:

- `example-workload-identity` with a name that describes your use-case.
- `/svc/foo` with the SPIFFE ID path you have decided on issuing.

Use `tctl create -f ./workload-identity.yaml` to create the Workload Identity.

Now, you'll need to create a role that will grant access to the Workload Identity
that you have just created. As with other Teleport resources, access is granted
by specifying label matchers on the role that will match the labels on the
resource itself.

In addition to granting access to the resource, we will also need to grant the
ability to read and list the Workload Identity resource type.

Create `workload-identity-issuer-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity-issuer
spec:
  allow:
    workload_identity_labels:
      example: ["getting-started"]
    rules:
    - resources:
      - workload_identity
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
```

Use `tctl create -f ./workload-identity-issuer-role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example-bot`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and
`example-workload-identity-issuer` with the name of the role you just created:

```code
$ tctl bots update example-bot --add-roles example-workload-identity-issuer
```

### Configuring DNS SANs

In some cases, you may wish to configure DNS SANs which should be included in
the X509 certificates issued by the Workload API. This is useful in cases
where the client may not be SPIFFE aware and will check the DNS SAN rather than
the SPIFFE URI during the TLS handshake.

Modify your `workload-identity.yaml` resource definition to include the
`spec.spiffe.x509.dns_sans` field, replacing `example.com` with the DNS name you
require:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: /svc/foo
    x509:
      dns_sans:
      - example.com
```

Use `tctl create -f ./workload-identity.yaml` to update the WorkloadIdentity
resource with your changes.

## Step 2/4. Configure `workload-identity-api` service in `tbot`

To set up a SPIFFE Workload API endpoint with `tbot`, we configure an instance
of the `workload-identity-api` service.

First, determine where you wish this socket to be created. In our example,
we'll use `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock`. You may wish to choose a directory
that is only accessible by the processes that will need to connect to the
Workload API.

Modify your `tbot` configuration file to include the `workload-identity-api`
service:

```yaml
services:
- type: workload-identity-api
  listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
  selector:
    name: example-workload-identity
```

Replace:

- `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path to the socket you wish to create.
- `example-workload-identity` with the name of the Workload Identity resource you
  created earlier.

Start or restart your `tbot` instance to apply the new configuration

### Configuring Unix Workload Attestation

By default, an SVID listed under the Workload API service will be issued to any
workload that connects to the Workload API. You may wish to restrict which SVIDs
are issued based on certain characteristics of the workload. This is known as
Workload Attestation.

When using the Unix listener, `tbot` supports workload attestation based on
three characteristics of the workload process:

- `uid`: The UID of the user that the workload process is running as.
- `gid`: The primary GID of the user that the workload process is running as.
- `pid`: The PID of the workload process.

Within a Workload Identity, you can configure rules based on the attributes
determined via workload attestation. Each rule contains a number of tests and
all tests must pass for the rule to pass. At least one rule must pass for the
Workload Identity to be allowed to issue a credential.

For example, to configure a Workload Identity to be issued only to workloads that
are running as the user with ID 1000 or running as a user with a primary group
ID of 50:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  rules:
    allow:
    - conditions:
      - attribute: workload.unix.uid
        eq:
          value: 1000
    - conditions:
      - attribute: workload.unix.gid
        eq:
          value: 50
  spiffe:
    id: /svc/foo
```

## Step 3/4. Testing the Workload API with `tbot spiffe-inspect`

The `tbot` binary includes a `spiffe-inspect` command that can be used to
test the configuration of the Workload API. This command will connect to the
Workload API and request SVIDs, whilst providing debug information.

Before configuring your workload to use the Workload API, we recommend using
this command to ensure that the Workload API is behaving as expected.

Use the `spiffe-inspect` command with `--path` to specify the path to the
Workload API socket, replacing `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path you
configured in the previous step:

```code
$ tbot spiffe-inspect --path unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
INFO [TBOT]      Inspecting SPIFFE Workload API Endpoint unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock tbot/spiffe.go:31
INFO [TBOT]      Received X.509 SVID context from Workload API bundles_count:1 svids_count:1 tbot/spiffe.go:46
SVIDS
- spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/foo
  - Expiry: 2024-03-20 10:55:52 +0000 UTC
Trust Bundles
- example.teleport.sh
```

## Step 4/4. Configuring your workload to use the Workload API

Now that you know that the Workload API is behaving as expected, you can
configure your workload to use it. The exact steps will depend on the workload.

In cases where you have used the SPIFFE SDKs, you can configure the
`SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` environment variable to point to the socket created by
`tbot`.

See the [Best Practices](./best-practices.mdx) guide for more information on
integrating SPIFFE with your workloads.
