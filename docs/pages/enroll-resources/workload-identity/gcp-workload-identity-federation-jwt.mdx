title: Configuring Workload Identity and GCP Workload Identity Federation with JWTs
description: Configuring GCP to accept Workload Identity JWTs as authentication using Workload Identity Federation
---

(!/docs/pages/includes/workload-id-preview.mdx!)

Teleport Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities in JWT format.
GCP Workload Identity Federation allows you to use these JWTs to authenticate to
GCP services.

This can be useful in cases where a machine needs to securely authenticate with
GCP services without the use of a long-lived credential. This is because the
machine can authenticate with Teleport without using any shared secrets by
using one of our delegated join methods.

In this guide, we'll configure Teleport Workload Identity and GCP to allow our
workload to authenticate to the GCP Cloud Storage API and upload content to a
bucket.

## How it works

This implementation differs from using the Teleport Application Service to protect
GCP APIs in a few ways:

- Requests to GCP are not proxied through the Teleport Proxy Service, meaning
  reduced latency but also less visibility, as these requests will not be
  recorded in Teleport's audit log.
- Workload Identity works with any GCP client, including the command-line tool
  but also their SDKs.
- Using the Teleport Application Service to access GCP does not work with Machine ID
  and therefore cannot be used when a machine needs to authenticate with AWS.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
information, see the [deployment guides](../machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx).

<Notice type="warning">
Issuing JWT SVIDs with Teleport Workload Identity requires at minimum version
16.4.3.
</Notice>

### Deciding on a SPIFFE ID structure

Within Teleport Workload Identity, all identities are represented using a
SPIFFE ID. This is a URI that uniquely identifies the entity that the identity
represents. The scheme is always `spiffe://`, and the host will be the name of
your Teleport cluster. The structure of the path of this URI is up to you.

For the purposes of this guide, we will be granting access to GCP to the
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service` SPIFFE ID.

If you have already deployed Teleport Workload Identity, then you will already
have a SPIFFE ID structure in place. If you have not, then you will need to
decide on a structure for your SPIFFE IDs.

If you are only using Teleport Workload Identity with GCP Workload Identity
Federation, you may structure your SPIFFE IDs so that they explicitly specify
the GCP service account they are allowed to assume. However, it often makes more
sense to name the workload or person that will use the SPIFFE ID. See the
[best practices guide](./best-practices.mdx) for further advice.

## Step 1/4. Configure GCP

Configuring GCP Workload Identity Federation for the first time involves a few
steps. Some of these may not be necessary if you have previously configured GCP
Workload Identity Federation for your Teleport cluster.

### Create a Workload Identity Pool and OIDC Provider

First, you'll need to create a workload identity pool and an OIDC provider
within this pool in GCP. A workload identity pool is an entity for managing
how external workload identities are represented within GCP.

The provider configures how the external identities should authenticate to the
pool. Since Teleport Workload Identity issues OIDC compatible JWT-SVIDs, you'll
use the OIDC provider type.

When configuring the pool, you need to choose a name to identify it. This name
should uniquely identify the source of the workload identities. It may make
sense to name it after your Teleport cluster. In this example, it will be called
`workload-id-pool`.

When configuring the provider, you need to specify the issuer URI. This will be
the public address of your Teleport Proxy Service with the path
`/workload-identity` appended. Your Teleport Proxy Service must be accessible
by GCP in order for OIDC federation to work.

You'll also specify an "attribute mapping". This determines how GCP will map the
identity within the JWT to a principal in GCP. Since we're using SVIDs, we'll
map the `sub` claim within the JWT to the `google.subject` attribute to
be able to use the workload's SPIFFE ID to make authorization decisions in GCP.

    # This will allow it to be used to make Authz decisions in GCP.
    --attribute-mapping="google.subject=assertion.sub"
```

### Create a storage bucket and RBAC

For the purposes of this guide, we'll be granting the workload access to a
GCP storage bucket. You can substitute this step to grant access to a different
service within GCP of your choice.

We'll be granting our workload identity direct access to the resource without
the workload assuming a service account.

To do this, we use the principal that is generated by the workload identity
federation pool based on the attribute mapping that we have already configured.
This principal can be used directly in IAM policies to grant privileges to a
workload identity. The principal contains the GCP project number, the name of
the workload identity pool and the SPIFFE ID. It takes the following format:

`principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_NAME/subject/$SPIFFE_ID`

It is also possible to grant a workload the ability to assume a service account.
This is not covered within this guide, but, can be useful in scenarios where you
already have a service account created with the necessary privileges and now
wish to allow the workload to use this without the use of a long-lived shared
secret.

<TabItem label="Terraform">

```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "demo" {
    // Replace with a meaningful, unique name.
    name          = "example"
    location      = "EU"
    force_destroy = true

    uniform_bucket_level_access = true
}

locals {
    // Replace with the SPIFFE ID of the workload that will access the bucket.
    allow_spiffe_id = "spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service"
}

resource "google_storage_bucket_iam_binding" "binding" {
    bucket = google_storage_bucket.demo.name
    role = "roles/storage.admin"
    members = [
        "principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/${data.google_project.project.number}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/${google_iam_workload_identity_pool.leaf_cluster.workload_identity_pool_id}/subject/${local.allow_spiffe_id}",
    ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="gcloud">

Create a storage bucket using the `gcloud` CLI:

```code
# Replace "example" with a meaningful, unique name.
$ gcloud storage buckets create gs://example \
    --location=EU \
    --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

Use the `gcloud` CLI to grant our workload access to the bucket:

```code
$ ROLE="roles/storage.admin"
# Replace PROJECT_NUMBER with your GCP project number.
$ PROJECT_NUMBER="123456789000"
# Replace POOL_ID with the ID of the Workload Identity Pool you created.
$ POOL_ID="workload-id-pool"
# Replace SPIFFE_ID with the SPIFFE ID of the workload that will access the bucket.
$ SPIFFE_ID="spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service"
$ MEMBER="principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/${PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/${POOL_ID}/subject/${SPIFFE_ID}"
$ gcloud storage buckets add-iam-policy-binding gs://example --member=$MEMBER --role=$ROLE
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/4. Configure Teleport RBAC

Now we need to configure Teleport to allow a JWT to be issued containing the
SPIFFE ID we have chosen.

First, you'll create a Workload Identity resource to define the identity and
its characteristics. Create a new file called `workload-identity.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: /svc/example-service
```

Apply this to your cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f workload-identity.yaml
```

Next, you'll create a role which grants access to this Workload Identity. Create
`role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity-issuer
spec:
  allow:
    workload_identity_labels:
      example: ["getting-started"]
    rules:
    - resources:
      - workload_identity
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
```

Replace:

- `example-workload-identity-issuer` with a descriptive name for the role.
- The labels selector if you have modified the labels of the Workload Identity.

Apply this role to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f role.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

You now need to assign this role to the bot:

```code
$ tctl bots update my-bot --add-roles example-workload-identity-issuer
```

## Step 3/4. Issue Workload Identity JWTs

You'll now configure `tbot` to issue and renew the short-lived JWT SVIDs for
your workload. It'll write the JWT as a file on disk, where you can then
configure GCP clients and SDKs to read it.

Before configuring this, you'll need to determine the correct audience to
request in the JWT SVIDs. This is specific to the Workload Identity Federation
configuration you have just created and contains three components:

- The project number of your GCP project
- The name of your Workload Identity Federation pool as configured in GCP
- The name of your Workload Identity Federation provider as configured in GCP

It has the following format: `https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_NAME/providers/$PROVIDER_NAME`.

Take your already deployed `tbot` service and configure it to issue SPIFFE SVIDs
by adding the following to the `tbot` configuration file:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: workload-identity-jwt
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/workload-identity
    selector:
      name: example-workload-identity
    audiences: ["https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/123456789000/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/workload-id-pool/providers/workload-id-oidc"]
```

Replace:

- `123456789000` with your GCP project number.
- `workload-id-pool` with the name of your Workload Identity Federation pool.
- `workload-id-oidc` with the name of your Workload Identity Federation provider.
- `example-workload-identity` with the name of the Workload Identity you have
  created.

Restart your `tbot` service to apply the new configuration. You should see a
file created at `/opt/workload-identity/jwt_svid` containing the JWT.

## Step 4/4. Configure GCP CLIs and SDKs

Finally, you need to create a configuration file to configure the GCP CLIs and
SDKs to authenticate using Workload Identity. This configuration file will
specify the path to the JWT file that `tbot` is writing and will specify which
Workload Identity Federation pool and provider to use.

You can generate this configuration file using the `gcloud` CLI:

```code
$ gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config \
    projects/123456789000/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/workload-id-pool/providers/workload-id-oidc \
    --output-file=gcp-workload-identity.json \
    --credential-source-file=/opt/workload-identity/jwt_svid \
    --credential-source-type=text
```

Replace:

- `123456789000` with your GCP project number.
- `workload-id-pool` with the name of your Workload Identity Federation pool.
- `workload-id-oidc` with the name of your Workload Identity Federation provider.
- `/opt/workload-identity/jwt_svid` with the path to the JWT file that `tbot` is
  writing.

The command should have created a file called `gcp-workload-identity.json` in
the current directory.

### `gcloud` CLI

To configure the `gcloud` CLI to authenticate using Workload Identity, you use
the `gcloud auth login` command and specify the path to the configuration file
that you have just created:

```code
$ gcloud auth login --cred-file gcp-workload-identity.json
```

You can now test authenticating to the GCP Storage API. Create a file which
you can upload to your bucket:

```code
$ echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
```

Now, use the `gcloud` CLI to upload this file to your bucket:

```code
$ gcloud storage cp hello.txt gs://example
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should see this file uploaded to your
bucket. Inspecting the audit logs on GCP should indicate that the request was
authenticated using Workload Identity and specify the SPIFFE ID of the workload
that made the request.

### GCP SDKs

To configure the GCP SDKs to authenticate using Workload Identity, you need to
set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the
configuration file that you have just created:

```code
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=gcp-workload-identity.json
```
