description: Configuring AWS to accept Workload Identity certificates as authentication using AWS Roles Anywhere

(!/docs/pages/includes/workload-id-preview.mdx!)

Teleport Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities in X.509
certificates. AWS Roles Anywhere allows you to use these certificates to
authenticate to AWS services.

This can be useful in cases where a machine needs to securely authenticate with
AWS services without the use of a long-lived credential. This is because the
machine can authenticate with Teleport without using any shared secrets by
using one of our delegated join methods.

## How it works

This implementation differs from using the Teleport Application Service to protect
AWS APIs in a few ways:

- Requests to AWS are not proxied through the Teleport Proxy Service, meaning
  reduced latency but also less visibility, as these requests will not be
  recorded in Teleport's audit log.
- Workload Identity works with any AWS client, including the command-line tool
  but also
  their SDKs.
- Using the Teleport Application Service to access AWS does not work with Machine ID
  and therefore cannot be used when a machine needs to authenticate with AWS.

Whilst this guide is primarily aimed at allowing a machine to access AWS,
the `tsh svid issue` command can be used in place of Machine ID to allow a human
user to authenticate with using AWS Roles Anywhere.

## OIDC Federation vs Roles Anywhere

The AWS platform offers two routes for workload identity federation: OIDC
Federation and Roles Anywhere. Teleport Workload Identity supports both of these
methods.

There are a number of differences between the two methods:

- Roles Anywhere exchanges an X509 SVID for an AWS credential, whereas OIDC
  Federation exchanges a JWT SVID for an AWS credential. The use of X509 SVIDs
  is generally considered more secure.
- Roles Anywhere requires the installation of an AWS credential helper alongside
  the workloads, whereas OIDC Federation does not.
- Roles Anywhere does not require the Teleport Proxy Service to be reachable by
  AWS, whereas OIDC Federation does.

This guide covers configuring Roles Anywhere, for OIDC federation, see
[Configuring Workload Identity and AWS OIDC Federation](./aws-oidc-federation.mdx).

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
information, see the [deployment guides](../machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx).

### Deciding on a SPIFFE ID structure

Within Teleport Workload Identity, all identities are represented using a
SPIFFE ID. This is a URI that uniquely identifies the entity that the identity
represents. The scheme is always `spiffe://`, and the host will be the name of
your Teleport cluster. The structure of the path of this URI is up to you.

For the purposes of this guide, we will be granting access to AWS to the
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service` SPIFFE ID.

If you have already deployed Teleport Workload Identity, then you will already
have a SPIFFE ID structure in place. If you have not, then you will need to
decide on a structure for your SPIFFE IDs.

If you are only using Teleport Workload Identity with AWS Roles Anywhere, you may
structure your SPIFFE IDs so that they explicitly specify the AWS role they are
allowed to assume. However, it often makes more sense to name the workload or
person that will use the SPIFFE ID. See the
[best practices guide](./best-practices.mdx) for further advice.

## Step 1/4. Configure AWS Roles Anywhere

Configuring AWS Roles Anywhere for the first time involves a few steps. Some
of these may not be necessary if you have previously configured AWS Roles
Anywhere for your Teleport cluster.

### Configure a Roles Anywhere Trust Anchor

If you have previously configured AWS Roles Anywhere for your Teleport cluster,
you can skip this step.

First, we must establish trust between your Teleport cluster and your AWS
Roles Anywhere. This will allow AWS to validate X.509 certificates that are
issued by your Teleport cluster. This is done by configuring the Teleport
cluster's SPIFFE certificate authority as the trust anchor for AWS Roles
Anywhere.

First, you must obtain your Teleport cluster's SPIFFE CA:

```code
$ tctl auth export --type tls-spiffe
```

Now, navigate to "Roles Anywhere" in the AWS console and click "Create a trust
anchor". You will need to give it a descriptive name, we suggest using the
name of your Teleport cluster with "spiffe" appended.

Select "External certificate bundle" and then paste the output you received
from the `tctl` command into the text box.

You can now click the "Create trust anchor" button.

### Create a Role

Next, we must create a role in AWS for your workload to assume. You may also
modify the trust policy of an existing role if you prefer.

Navigate to the "Roles" section of the AWS IAM console and click "Create role".

For the "Trusted entity type" select "Custom trust policy".

You will now enter the following:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "rolesanywhere.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole",
                "sts:TagSession",
                "sts:SetSourceIdentity"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:PrincipalTag/x509SAN/URI": "spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service"
                },
                "ArnEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:rolesanywhere:us-east-1:12345789:trust-anchor/0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Replace:

- `spiffe://example.teleport.sh/my-workload` with the SPIFFE ID you have chosen
  for your workload.
- `arn:aws:rolesanywhere:us-east-1:12345789:trust-anchor/0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`
  with the ARN of the trust anchor you created in the previous step.

Click "Next" to proceed to the "Add permissions" page. Now select the
permissions you wish to grant to your workload on AWS.

Click "Next" to proceed to the "Name, review, and create" page. Give your role
a descriptive name, e.g "my-workload-roles-anywhere".

Click "Create role".

### Create a Roles Anywhere Profile

Finally, you must create a Roles Anywhere profile.

Navigate back to the "Roles Anywhere" section of the AWS IAM console and click
"Create a profile".

Give your profile a descriptive name, e.g "my-workload".

Select the role you created in the previous step.

Click "Create profile".

## Step 2/4. Configure Teleport RBAC

Now we need to configure Teleport to allow a X.509 certificate to be issued
containing the SPIFFE ID we have chosen.

First, you'll create a Workload Identity resource to define the identity and
its characteristics. Create a new file called `workload-identity.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: /svc/example-service
```

Replace:

- `example-workload-identity` with a descriptive name for the Workload Identity.
- `/svc/example-service` with the path part of the SPIFFE ID you have chosen.

Apply this to your cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f workload-identity.yaml
```

Next, you'll create a role which grants access to this Workload Identity. Create
`role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity-issuer
spec:
  allow:
    workload_identity_labels:
      example: ["getting-started"]
    rules:
    - resources:
      - workload_identity
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
```

Replace:

- `example-workload-identity-issuer` with a descriptive name for the role.
- The labels selector if you have modified the labels of the Workload Identity.

Apply this role to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f role.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

If you intend this SPIFFE ID to be issued by a human, you now need to assign
this role to their user:

```code
$ tctl edit user/my-user
# And add the role to the user's roles list
```

If you intend this SPIFFE ID to be issued by a machine, you now need to assign
this role to the bot:

```code
$ tctl bots update my-bot --add-roles example-workload-identity-issuer
```

## Step 3/4. Issue Workload Identity certificates

### For machines using `tbot`

For machines, the `tbot` service can be used to issue and renew SPIFFE SVIDs
as a background process.

Take your already deployed `tbot` service and configure it to issue SPIFFE SVIDs
by adding the following to the `tbot` configuration file:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: workload-identity-x509
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/roles-anywhere-svid
    selector:
      name: example-workload-identity
```
Replace:

- /opt/roles-anywhere-svid with the directory where you want the X509 to be
  written.
- example-workload-identity with the name of the Workload Identity you have
  created

Restart your `tbot` service to apply the new configuration.

### For humans using `tsh`

For humans, the `tsh` CLI can be used to issue a SPIFFE SVID using their
pre-existing authentication session.

The `tsh` command will need to be re-invoked when the SVID expires. By default,
SVIDs are issued with a TTL of 1 hour, but this can be configured to be up to
24 hours. It can be convenient to configure this to around 8 hours to allow
an engineer to run the command once at the start of their working day.

For example, to issue a SPIFFE SVID for `/svc/example-service` with an 8 hour
TTL:

```code
$ tsh workload-identity issue-x509 --name-selector example-workload-identity --credential-ttl 8h --output /opt/roles-anywhere-svid
```

## Step 4/4. Configure the AWS CLI and SDKs to use Roles Anywhere to authenticate

In order for AWS to use the SVID for authentication, you must also install the
AWS Roles Anywhere credential helper. This is a small utility that the AWS
CLI and SDKs will use to exchange the SVID for a temporary AWS credential.

Obtain the latest release of the credential helper from the
[Obtaining temporary security credentials from AWS Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/credential-helper.html)
guide.

Now, you need to configure a profile that leverages this credential helper.

Add the following to your `~/.aws/config` file:

```ini
[profile use-roles-anywhere]
credential_process = ./aws_signing_helper credential-process --certificate /opt/roles-anywhere-svid/svid.pem --private-key /opt/roles-anywhere-svid/svid_key.pem --profile-arn $PROFILE_ARN --trust-anchor-arn $TRUST_ANCHOR_ARN --role-arn $ROLE_ARN
```

Replace $PROFILE_ARN, $TRUST_ANCHOR_ARN, and $ROLE_ARN with the ARNs of the
profile, trust anchor, and role you created in the previous steps.

You can now use the `use-roles-anywhere` profile with the AWS CLI, for example:

```code
$ aws --profile use-roles-anywhere s3 ls
```

You can also use this profile with the AWS SDKs by setting the `AWS_PROFILE`
environment variable:

```code
$ export AWS_PROFILE=use-roles-anywhere
$ ./my-app
```
