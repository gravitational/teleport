title: Configuring Workload Identity and AWS OIDC Federation
description: Configuring AWS to accept Workload Identity JWTs as authentication using OIDC Federation
---

<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
Teleport Workload Identity is currently in Preview. This means that some
features may be missing. We're actively looking for design partners to help us
shape the future of Workload Identity and would love to
[hear your feedback](mailto:product@goteleport.com).
</Admonition>

Teleport Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities in JWT format.
AWS OIDC Federation allows you to use these JWTs to authenticate to AWS
services.

This can be useful in cases where a machine needs to securely authenticate with
AWS services without the use of a long-lived credential. This is because the
machine can authenticate with Teleport without using any shared secrets by
using one of our delegated join methods.

In this guide, we'll configure Teleport Workload Identity and AWS to allow our
workload to authenticate to the AWS S3 API and upload content to a bucket.

## How it works

This implementation differs from using the Teleport Application Service to protect
AWS APIs in a few ways:

- Requests to AWS are not proxied through the Teleport Proxy Service, meaning
  reduced latency but also less visibility, as these requests will not be
  recorded in Teleport's audit log.
- Workload Identity works with any AWS client, including the command-line tool
  but also their SDKs.
- Using the Teleport Application Service to access AWS does not work with Machine
  ID and therefore cannot be used when a machine needs to authenticate with AWS.

## OIDC Federation vs Roles Anywhere

The AWS platform offers two routes for workload identity federation: OIDC
Federation and Roles Anywhere. Teleport Workload Identity supports both of these
methods.

There are a number of differences between the two methods:

- OIDC Federation exchanges a JWT SVID for an AWS credential, whereas Roles
  Anywhere exchanges an X509 SVID for an AWS credential. The use of X509 SVIDs
  is generally considered more secure.
- OIDC Federation does not require the additional installation of an AWS
  credential helper alongside workloads, whereas Roles Anywhere does.
- OIDC Federation requires that your Teleport Proxy Service is reachable by
  AWS, whereas Roles Anywhere does not.

This guide covers configuring OIDC federation. For Roles Anywhere, see
[Configuring Workload Identity and AWS Roles Anywhere](./aws-roles-anywhere.mdx).

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
information, see the [deployment guides](../machine-id/deployment.mdx).

<Notice type="warning">
Issuing JWT SVIDs with Teleport Workload Identity requires at least Teleport
version 16.4.3.
</Notice>

### Deciding on a SPIFFE ID structure

Within Teleport Workload Identity, all identities are represented using a
SPIFFE ID. This is a URI that uniquely identifies the entity that the identity
represents. The scheme is always `spiffe://`, and the host will be the name of
your Teleport cluster. The structure of the path of this URI is up to you.

For the purposes of this guide, we will be granting access to AWS to the
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service` SPIFFE ID.

If you have already deployed Teleport Workload Identity, then you will already
have a SPIFFE ID structure in place. If you have not, then you will need to
decide on a structure for your SPIFFE IDs.

If you are only using Teleport Workload Identity with AWS OIDC Federation, you
may structure your SPIFFE IDs so that they explicitly specify the AWS role they
are allowed to assume. However, it often makes more sense to name the workload
or person that will use the SPIFFE ID. See the
[best practices guide](./best-practices.mdx) for further advice.

## Step 1/4. Configure AWS

Configuring AWS OIDC Federation for the first time involves a few steps. Some of
these may not be necessary if you have previously configured AWS OIDC Federation
for your Teleport cluster.

### Create an OpenID Connect Identity Provider

First, you'll need to create an OIDC identity provider in AWS. This will define
a trust relationship between AWS and your Teleport cluster's Workload Identity
issuer. You can reuse this OIDC identity provider to grant different workloads
using Teleport Workload Identity access to AWS services.

When configuring the provider, you need to specify the issuer URI. This will be
the public address of your Teleport Proxy Service with the path
`/workload-identity` appended. Your Teleport Proxy Service must be accessible
by AWS in order for OIDC federation to work.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

Before you can configure the OIDC identity provider, you need to determine the
thumbprint of the TLS certificate used by your Teleport Proxy Service. You can
do this using `curl`:

```code
$ curl https://example.teleport.sh/webapi/thumbprint
"example589ee4bf31a11b78c72b8d13f0example"%
```

Insert the following into a Terraform configuration file which has already
been configured to manage your AWS account:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "example_teleport_sh_workload_identity" {
  // Replace "example.teleport.sh" with the hostname used to access your
  // Teleport Proxy Service.
  url = "https://example.teleport.sh/workload-identity"

  client_id_list = [
    "sts.amazonaws.com",
  ]

  thumbprint_list = [
    // Replace with the thumbprint you determined using curl.
    "example589ee4bf31a11b78c72b8d13f0example"
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="AWS Console">

1. Browse to IAM
1. Select "Identity Providers" from the sidebar
1. Select "Add provider"
1. Select "OpenID Connect" as the "Provider type".
1. Specify the public hostname of your Teleport Proxy Service, with
  "/workload-identity" appended as the "Provider URL", e.g
  `https://example.teleport.sh/workload-identity`
1. Specify `sts.amazonaws.com` as the Audience
1. Click "Add Provider".

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create an S3 bucket

For the purposes of this guide, you'll be granting the workload access to an
AWS S3 bucket. Before we can dive into configuring the RBAC, we'll need to
create our bucket.

You can omit this step if you wish to grant access to a different service
within AWS.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terraform">
```hcl
// Create an S3 bucket
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  // Replace "example" with a meaningful, unique name.
  bucket = "workload-id-demo"
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="AWS Console">

1. Browse to S3
1. Select "Create bucket"
1. Enter a meaningful, unique name for your bucket, e.g `workload-id-demo`
1. Leave other settings as default
1. Click "Create bucket".

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure RBAC

#### Create an IAM Policy

First, create an IAM policy that will grant access to the S3 bucket. Later,
you'll attach this to a role that the workload will assume.

The examples in this guide will create an IAM policy that will grant full access
to the example bucket. In a production environment, you should modify this to
grant the least privileges necessary.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

Insert the following into your Terraform configuration file:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "example" {
  // Choose a unique, meaningful name that describes what the policy grants
  // access to.
  name        = "workload-id-s3-full-access"
  path        = "/"

  // This example policy grants full access to AWS S3. In production, you
  // may wish to grant a less permissive policy.
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action = "s3:*"
      Effect = "Allow"
      Resource = [
        aws_s3_bucket.workload_id_demo.arn,
        "${aws_s3_bucket.workload_id_demo.arn}/*"
      ]
    }]
  })
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="AWS Console">

1. Browse to IAM
1. Select "Policies" from the sidebar
1. Click "Create policy"
1. Choose the "S3" service
1. Under "Actions allowed", choose "All S3 actions"
1. Under "Resources", choose "Specific"
  1. For "bucket" enter the name of the bucket you created earlier.
  1. For "object" enter the name of the bucket you created earlier and select
    "All objects"
1. Click "Next"
1. Enter a unique and meaningful name for this policy, in our example, this will
  be `workload-id-s3-full-access`
1. Click "Create policy"

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Create an IAM Role

Now, you'll create an IAM role. This role will be assumed by the workload
after it authenticates to AWS using the JWT SVID issued by Teleport Workload
Identity.

When creating the IAM role, you'll define a trust policy that controls which
workload identities are able to assume the role. This policy will contain
conditions which will be evaluated against the claims within the JWT SVID
issued by Teleport Workload Identity. In our case, the only claim we want to 
evaluate is the `sub` claim, which will contain our workload's SPIFFE ID.

Finally, we'll attach the IAM policy we created earlier to this role to grant it
the privileges specified within the policy.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Terraform">

Insert the following into your Terraform configuration file:

```hcl
// Create a role that the workload identity will assume.
resource "aws_iam_role" "example" {
  // Choose a unique, meaningful name that describes the role and the workload
  // that will assume it.
  name = "workload-id-demo"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Federated = aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.example.arn
      }
      Action = "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
      Condition = {
        StringEquals = {
          "${aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.example.url}:aud" = "sts.amazonaws.com"
          "${aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.example.url}:sub" = "spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service"
        }
      }
    }]
  })
}

// Attach the policy we created earlier to our role.
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "example" {
    role       = aws_iam_role.example.name
    policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.example.arn
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="AWS Console">

1. Browse to IAM
1. Select "Roles" from the sidebar
1. Click "Create role"
1. Select "Web identity" for the "Trusted entity type"
1. Select your identity provider
1. Select the `sts.amazonaws.com` audience
1. Click "Add condition"
  1. Select `example.teleport.sh:sub` for the key
  1. Select "StringEquals" for the condition
  1. Enter the SPIFFE ID of your workload for the value. In our example, this 
    will be `spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example
1. Click "Next"
1. Select the IAM policy you created earlier, and click "Next"
1. Enter a unique and meaningful name for this role, in our example, this will
  be `workload-id-demo`
1. Click "Create role"

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2/4. Configure Teleport RBAC

Now we need to configure Teleport to allow a JWT to be issued containing the
SPIFFE ID we have chosen.

Create `role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: my-workload-aws
spec:
  allow:
    spiffe:
      - path: /svc/example-service
```

Replace:

- `my-workload-aws` with a descriptive name for the role.
- `/svc/example-service` with the path part of the SPIFFE ID you have chosen.

Apply this role to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f role.yaml
```

You now need to assign this role to the bot:

```code
$ tctl bots update my-bot --add-roles my-workload-aws
```

## Step 3/4. Issue Workload Identity JWTs

You'll now configure `tbot` to issue and renew the short-lived JWT SVIDs for
your workload. It'll write the JWT as a file on disk, where you can then
configure AWS clients and SDKs to read it.

Take your already deployed `tbot` service and configure it to issue SPIFFE SVIDs
by adding the following to the `tbot` configuration file:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: spiffe-svid
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/workload-identity
    svid:
      path: /svc/example-service
    jwts:
      - audience: sts.amazonaws.com
        file_name: aws-jwt
```

Replace:

- /opt/workload-identity with the directory where you want the JWT to be
  written.
- /svc/example-service with the SPIFFE ID you have chosen.

Restart your `tbot` service to apply the new configuration. You should see a
file created at `/opt/workload-identity/aws-jwt` containing the JWT.

## Step 4/4. Configure AWS CLIs and SDKs

Finally, you need to configure the AWS CLIs and SDKs to use the JWT SVID for 
authentication.

This can be done using the configuration file located at `~/.aws/config` or by
using environment variables.

To proceed, you'll need to know the ARN of the role you created earlier.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Configuration File">

Add the following to your `~/.aws/config` file:

```ini
# You can replace "workload-id-demo" with a recognizable name that identifies
# your use-case.
[profile workload-id-demo]
# Replace with the ARN of the role you created earlier.
role_arn=arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/workload-id-demo
# Replace with the directory and file name you configured `tbot` to write the
# JWT to.
web_identity_token_file=/opt/workload-identity/aws-jwt
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Environment Variables">

Configure the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: The ARN of the role you created earlier, e.g 
  `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/workload-id-demo`
- `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`: The path to the JWT file that `tbot` is writing,
  e.g `/opt/workload-identity/aws-jwt`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can now test authenticating to the AWS S3 API. Create a file which you can
upload to your bucket:

```code
$ echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
```

Now, use the AWS CLI to upload this file to your bucket:

```code
$ aws s3 cp hello.txt s3://workload-id-demo
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should see this file uploaded to your
bucket:

```code
$ aws s3 ls s3://workload-id-demo
```

Inspecting the audit logs on CloudTrail should indicate that the request
was authenticated using Workload Identity and specify the SPIFFE ID of the
workload that made the request.
