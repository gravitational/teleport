<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
Teleport Workload Identity is currently in Preview. This means that some
features may be missing. We're actively looking for design partners to help us
shape the future of Workload Identity and would love to
[hear your feedback](mailto:product@goteleport.com).

One type of credential that can be issued by Teleport Workload Identity is a
JWT SVID. This is a short-lived JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains the identity
of the workload and is signed by the Teleport Workload Identity CA.

## Claims

The JWT contains the following claims:

- `sub`: The SPIFFE ID of the workload.
- `aud`: The audience of the JWT. This indicates the intended recipient and
  limits the potential for token reuse.
- `exp`: The expiration time of the JWT. By default, Teleport issues JWT-SVIDs
  with a 5-minute expiration lifetime.
- `iat`: The time at which the JWT was issued.
- `jti`: A unique identifier for this JWT. This allows a JWT-SVID to be
  correlated with audit logs pertaining to its issuance.
- `iss`: The issuer of the JWT. This is the host extracted from the public
  address configured for your Teleport Proxy Service.

The JWT-SVID can be useful in scenarios where X509-SVIDs are not suitable.
For example, when the workload needs to authenticate to another workload which
is behind a TLS-terminating load balancer.

## OIDC Compatibility

The JWT SVIDs issued by Teleport Workload Identity are compatible with the
specification for OIDC ID Tokens. This means that they can be used by workloads
to authenticate to services that accept OIDC ID tokens as a form of
authentication.

The OIDC compatibility is powered by two endpoints exposed by the Teleport
Proxy Service:

- `/workload-identity/.well-known/openid-configuration`: This endpoint exposes
  the OIDC configuration for the Teleport Workload Identity CA. This includes
  the issuer URL and the supported signing algorithms.
- `/workload-identity/jwt-jwks.json`: This endpoint exposes the public signing
  keys for the Teleport Workload Identity CA.

In order for OIDC federation to function correctly, these two endpoints must be
accessible from the service that you intend to use the JWT SVIDs to
authenticate to.

Teleport Workload Identity uses the publicly configured address for your
Teleport Proxy service as the issuer URL for OIDC configuration.

We have tested Teleport Workload Identity issued JWT-SVIDs with the following
platforms:

- AWS
- [Google Cloud Platform](./gcp-workload-identity-federation-jwt.mdx)
- Azure
