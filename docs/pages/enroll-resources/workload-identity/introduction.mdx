(!/docs/pages/includes/workload-id-preview.mdx!)

Teleport Workload Identity securely issues flexible, short-lived cryptographic 
identities to workloads.

The flexible nature of Teleport Workload Identity means it can be leveraged for
a wide range of use-cases, including:

- Replacing long-lived shared secrets for authentication to third-party APIs
  (e.g AWS, GCP, Azure etc.), regardless of which platform the workload is
  running on.
- Issuing X.509 certificates and distributing certificate authorities to enable
  secure mTLS between services within your infrastructure as part of a wider
  zero-trust implementation.



The identities and API implement the open-source
[Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) standard](./spiffe.mdx),
allowing interoperability for authentication between workloads using different
workload identity implementations and enabling the use of a number of
off-the-shelf SPIFFE-compatible tools and SDKs.

Teleport Workload Identity brings a number of Teleport features you are
already familiar with, such as:

- Auditing of the issuance of workload identities.
- Powerful RBAC for controlling the issuance of workload identities.
- Rotation and management of the workload identity CA, including support for
  HSMs.

## Teleport Workload Identity vs Machine ID

Teleport Machine ID issues short-lived credentials to workloads to enable them
to access resources secured by the Teleport cluster. The credentials issued are
only compatible with Teleport itself, and access to resources must be through
the Teleport Proxy.

Teleport Workload Identity issues cryptographic identities that are compatible
with the popular SPIFFE standard for interoperable workload identity. These 
identities are flexible enough to be used for a range of purposes. The 
Teleport Proxy is not used for securing workload-to-workload communication.
