(!/docs/pages/includes/workload-id-preview.mdx!)

Teleport Workload Identity securely issues short-lived cryptographic identities
to workloads. It is a flexible foundation for workload identity across your 
infrastructure, creating a uniform way for your workloads to authenticate 
regardless of where they are running.

The flexible nature of Teleport Workload Identity enables it to be used for a
range of purposes, including:

- Workload authentication to third-party APIs on cloud platforms such as AWS, 
  GCP and Azure.
- Providing X.509 certificates for mutual TLS authentication between workloads
  within your infrastructure as part of a Zero Trust strategy.
- Workload authentication between services within your infrastructure. 

Teleport Workload Identity is compatible with the open-source
[Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE)](./spiffe.mdx)
standard. This enables interoperability between workload identity
implementations and also provides a wealth of off-the-shelf tools and SDKs to
simplify integration with your workloads. 

## How it works

## Teleport Workload Identity vs Machine ID

Teleport Machine ID issues short-lived credentials to workloads to enable them
to access resources secured by the Teleport cluster. The credentials issued are
only compatible with Teleport itself, and access to resources must be through
the Teleport Proxy.

Teleport Workload Identity issues cryptographic identities that are compatible
with the popular SPIFFE standard for interoperable workload identity. These 
identities are flexible enough to be used for a range of purposes. The 
Teleport Proxy is not used for securing workload-to-workload communication.
