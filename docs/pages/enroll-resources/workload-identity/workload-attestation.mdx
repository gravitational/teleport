(!/docs/pages/includes/workload-id-preview.mdx!)

Workload Attestation is the process completed by `tbot` to assert the identity
of a workload that has connected to the Workload API and requested certificates.
The information gathered during attestation is used to decide which, if any,
SPIFFE IDs should be encoded into an SVID and issued to the workload.

Workload Attestors are the individual components that perform this attestation.
They use the process ID of the workload to gather information about the workload
from platform-specific APIs. For example, the Kubernetes Workload Attestor
queries the local Kubelet API to determine which Kubernetes pod the process
belongs to.

The result of the attestation process is known as attestation metadata. This
attestation metadata is referred to by the rules you configured for `tbot`'s
Workload API service. For example, you may state that only workloads running in
a specific Kubernetes namespace should be issued a specific SPIFFE ID.

Additionally, this metadata is included in the log messages output by `tbot`
when it issues an SVID. This allows you to audit the issuance of SVIDs and
understand why a specific SPIFFE ID was issued to a workload.

## Unix

The Unix Workload Attestor is the most basic attestor and allows you to restrict
the issuance of SVIDs to specific Unix processes based on a range of criteria.

### Attestation Metadata

The following metadata is produced by the Unix Workload Attestor and is
available to be used when configuring rules for `tbot`'s Workload API service:

| Field             | Description                                                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unix.attested`   | Indicates that the workload has been attested by the Unix Workload Attestor. |
| `unix.pid`        | The process ID of the attested workload.                                     |
| `unix.uid`        | The effective user ID of the attested workload.                              |
| `unix.gid`        | The effective primary group ID of the attested workload.                     |

### Support for non-standard procfs mounting

To resolve information about a process from the PID, the Unix Workload Attestor
reads information from the procfs filesystem. By default, it expects procfs to
be mounted at `/proc`.

If procfs is mounted at a different location, you must configure the Unix
Workload Attestor to read from that alternative location by setting the
`HOST_PROC` environment variable.

This is a sensitive configuration option, and you should ensure that it is
set correctly or not set at all. If misconfigured, an attacker could provide
falsified information about processes, and this could lead to the issuance of
SVIDs to unauthorized workloads.

## Kubernetes

The Kubernetes Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of SVIDs
to specific Kubernetes workloads based on a range of criteria.

It works by first determining the pod ID for a given process ID and then by
querying the local kubelet API for details about that pod.

### Attestation Metadata

The following metadata is produced by the Kubernetes Workload Attestor and is
available to be used when configuring rules for `tbot`'s Workload API service:

| Field                        | Description                                                                        |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `kubernetes.attested`      | Indicates that the workload has been attested by the Kubernetes Workload Attestor. |
| `kubernetes.namespace`       | The namespace of the Kubernetes Pod.                                               |
| `kubernetes.service_account` | The service account of the Kubernetes Pod.                                         |
| `kubernetes.pod_name`        | The name of the Kubernetes Pod.                                                    |

### Deployment Guidance

To use Kubernetes Workload Attestation, `tbot` must be deployed as a daemon
set. This is because the unix domain socket can only be accessed by pods on the
same node as the agent. Additionally, the daemon set must have the `hostPID`
property set to `true` to allow the agent to access information about
processes within other containers.

The daemon set must also have a service account assigned that allows it to query
the Kubelet API. This is an example role with the required RBAC:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tbot
rules:
  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]
    apiGroups: [""]
    verbs: ["get"]
```

Mapping the Workload API Unix domain socket into the containers of workloads
can be done in two ways:

- Directly configuring a hostPath volume for the `tbot` daemonset and workloads
  which will need to connect to it.
- Using [spiffe-csi-driver](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe-csi).

Example manifests for required Kubernetes resources:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tbot
rules:
  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]
    apiGroups: [""]
    verbs: ["get"]
