title: Configuring Workload Identity and Azure Federated Credentials
description: Configuring Azure to accept Workload Identity JWTs as authentication using Azure Federated Credentials
---

(!/docs/pages/includes/workload-id-preview.mdx!)

Teleport Workload Identity issues flexible short-lived identities in JWT format.
Azure Federated Credentials allows you to use these JWTs to authenticate to
Azure services.

This can be useful in cases where a machine needs to securely authenticate with
Azure services without the use of a long-lived credential. This is because the
machine can authenticate with Teleport without using any shared secrets by
using one of our delegated join methods.

In this guide, we'll configure Teleport Workload Identity and Azure to allow our
workload to authenticate to the Azure Blob Storage and upload content to a
container.

## How it works

This implementation differs from using the Teleport Application Service to
protect Azure APIs in a few ways:

- Requests to Azure are not proxied through the Teleport Proxy Service, meaning
  reduced latency but also less visibility, as these requests will not be
  recorded in Teleport's audit log.
- Workload Identity works with any Azure client, including the command-line tool
  but also their SDKs.
- Using the Teleport Application Service to access Azure does not work with
  Machine ID and therefore cannot be used when a machine needs to authenticate
  with Azure.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the host where the
  workloads which need to access Teleport Workload Identity will run. For more
  information, see the [deployment
  guides](../machine-id/deployment/deployment.mdx).
- An Azure resource group and subscription you wish to grant the workload access
  to.

<Notice type="warning">
Issuing JWT SVIDs with Teleport Workload Identity requires at least Teleport
version 16.4.3.
</Notice>

### Deciding on a SPIFFE ID structure

Within Teleport Workload Identity, all identities are represented using a
SPIFFE ID. This is a URI that uniquely identifies the entity that the identity
represents. The scheme is always `spiffe://`, and the host will be the name of
your Teleport cluster. The structure of the path of this URI is up to you.

For the purposes of this guide, we will be granting access to Azure to the
`spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service` SPIFFE ID.

If you have already deployed Teleport Workload Identity, then you will already
have a SPIFFE ID structure in place. If you have not, then you will need to
decide on a structure for your SPIFFE IDs.

If you are only using Teleport Workload Identity with AWS OIDC Federation, you
may structure your SPIFFE IDs so that they explicitly specify the Azure
user-managed identity they are allowed to assume. However, it often makes more
sense to name the workload or person that will use the SPIFFE ID. See the
[best practices guide](./best-practices.mdx) for further advice.

## Step 1/4. Configure Azure

To configure Azure to accept Workload Identity JWT SVIDs as authentication,
you'll need to create an identity to represent that workload within Azure, 
configure that identity to accept JWT SVIDs issued by your Teleport Cluster as
a federated credential, and then grant that identity the necessary permissions
within Azure using a role assignment.

### Create a user-managed identity

First, you'll create a user-managed identity to represent the workload within
Azure.

1. Browse to the "Managed Identities" section of the Azure Portal.
1. Select "Create" to open the "Create User Assigned Managed Identity" form.
1. Select your resource group and subscription.
1. Enter a unique name for your identity that describes the workload it will
  represent. In our example, we will use "example-service".
1. Select "Review + create".

You now need to record some key information about the created user-managed
identity to be used in future steps.

Browse to the "Properties" section on the created user-managed identity and note
down the "Client Id" and "Tenant Id", these values will both be UUIDs.

### Create a federated credential

Next, you need to configure a federated credential for the user-managed
identity. This will configure Azure to accept JWT SVIDs issued by your Teleport
cluster as a form of authentication for this user-managed identity.

1. Browse to your user-managed identity in the Azure Portal and select the 
  "Federated credentials" page from the "Settings" section.
1. Select "Add Credential" to open the "Add Federated Credential" form.
1. Select "Other" for the "Federated credential scenario".
1. Enter the address of your Teleport Proxy service followed by
  `/workload-identity` for the "Issuer URL", for example
  `https://example.teleport.sh/workload-identity`.
1. Enter the SPIFFE ID you have decided on for the workload in the
  "Subject identifier" field. For example,
  `spiffe://example.teleport.sh/svc/example-service`. This will control which
  JWT SVIDs issued by Teleport Workload Identity will be accepted for this
  user-managed identity.
1. Enter a unique, identifiable name for the federated credential. For example,
   `example-teleport-sh-svc-example-service`.
1. Click "Add".

### Create a storage account and container

For the purposes of this guide, you'll create a storage account and container
for your workload to authenticate to. You can skip this step if you already have
resources you wish to grant the workload access to.

First, create a storage account:

1. Browse to the "Storage accounts" section of the Azure Portal and select the 
  "Create" button to open the "Create a storage account" form.
1. Select your resource group and subscription.
1. Enter a unique, identifiable name for the storage account. Record this as 
  you will need it later. In our examples we will use `examplestorageaccount`.
1. Select a region and select "Azure Blob Storage" for the "Primary Service"
  field.
1. Click "Create".

Now, you can create a storage container:

1. Browse to the "Storage accounts" section of the Azure Portal and select the
  storage account you created.
1. Browse to the "Containers" section beneath the "Data storage" section.
1. Select "Add container" to open the "New container" form.
1. Enter a unique, identifiable name for the container. Record this as you will
  need it later. In our examples we will use `examplecontainer`.

### Create a role assignment

Finally, you need to grant the user-managed identity the necessary permissions
for your workload to perform the actions it needs to within Azure.

When creating a role assignment in Azure, it can be scoped to different levels:

- Subscription (to grant access to any resource within the subscription)
- Resource Group (to grant access to any resource within the resource group)
- Resource (to grant access to a specific resource)

For the purposes of this guide, we will grant the user-managed identity the
`Storage Blob Data Owner` role with the scope of the storage account you have
created.

1. Browse to the "Storage accounts" section of the Azure Portal and select the
  storage account you created.
1. Browse to "Access control (IAM)" in the sidebar, then select "Add" and "Add
  role assignment".
1. Under "Role" select "Storage Blob Data Owner".
1. Under "Members", for "Assign access to" select "Managed identity" and then
  press "Select members".
1. For "Managed identity", select "User-assigned managed identity" and then 
  search for and select the user-managed identity you created earlier.
1. Click "Review + assign" and save your changes.

## Step 2/4. Configure Teleport RBAC

Now we need to configure Teleport to allow a JWT to be issued containing the
SPIFFE ID we have chosen.

Create `role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: my-workload-azure
spec:
  allow:
    spiffe:
      - path: /svc/example-service
```

Replace:

- `my-workload-azure` with a descriptive name for the role.
- `/svc/example-service` with the path part of the SPIFFE ID you have chosen.

Apply this role to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f role.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

You now need to assign this role to the bot:

```code
$ tctl bots update my-bot --add-roles my-workload-azure
```

## Step 3/4. Issue Workload Identity JWTs

You'll now configure `tbot` to issue and renew the short-lived JWT SVIDs for
your workload. It'll write the JWT as a file on disk, where you can then
configure Azure clients and SDKs to read it.

Take your already deployed `tbot` service and configure it to issue SPIFFE SVIDs
by adding the following to the `tbot` configuration file:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: spiffe-svid
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/workload-identity
    svid:
      path: /svc/example-service
    jwts:
      - audience: api://AzureADTokenExchange
        file_name: azure-jwt
```

Replace:

- /opt/workload-identity with the directory where you want the JWT to be
  written.
- /svc/example-service with the SPIFFE ID you have chosen.

Restart your `tbot` service to apply the new configuration. You should see a
file created at `/opt/workload-identity/azure-jwt` containing the JWT.

## Step 4/4. Configure the Azure CLIs and SDKs

You can now use the issued JWT SVID to authenticate to Azure. How this is
configured varies between the Azure CLI and Azure SDK.

### Configuring Azure CLI

To use the JWT SVID to authenticate with the Azure CLI, you perform
log-in specifying the JWT and the client and tenant ID of the user-managed 
identity you created. This performs an initial exchange of the JWT SVID for an
Azure access token, which is then cached by the CLI until the access token 
expires.

Run the following, inserting the client and tenant id you recorded in the first
step:

```code
$ az login \ 
  --federated-token $(cat /opt/workload-identity/azure-jwt) \
  --service-principal \
  -u <user-managed-identity-client-id> \
  -t <user-managed-identity-tenant-id>
```

You should see a message indicating that this has succeeded.

You can now test this has succeeded by uploading a file to the Azure Blob
Storage container:

```sh
$ echo "testing 1,2,3..." > test.txt
# Upload a test file. Replace the name of the account and container with those
# you selected earlier.
$ az storage blob upload \
  --auth login \
  --account-name examplestorageaccount \
  --container-name examplecontainer \
  --name test.txt \
  --file ./test.txt
# Check that the file has been uploaded. Replace the name of teh account and
# container with those you selected earlier.
$ az storage blob list \
  --auth login \
  --output table \
  --account-name examplestorageaccount \
  --container-name examplecontainer
```

### Configuring Azure SDKs

The Azure SDKs support a set of environment variables to configure them to use
the federated credential for authentication with the issued JWT SVID:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of the user-managed identity.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: The tenant ID of the user-managed identity.
- `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`: The path to the JWT SVID file, for example
  `/opt/workload-identity/azure-jwt`.

You can also explicitly configure the SDK to use the federated credential, this
will vary language-to-language.
