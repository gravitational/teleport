`teleport.yaml` fields related to desktop access:

```yaml
# Main service responsible for desktop access.
#
# You can have multiple Desktop Service instances in your cluster (but not in the
# same teleport.yaml), connected to the same or different Active Directory
# domains.
(!docs/pages/includes/config-reference/desktop-config.yaml!)
```

## Deployment

The Windows Desktop Service can be deployed in two modes.

### Direct mode

In *direct* mode, Windows Desktop Services registers directly with the Teleport
Auth Server, and listens for desktop connections from the Teleport Proxy. To
enable direct mode, set `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` in
`teleport.yaml`, and ensure that `teleport.auth_server` points directly at the
Auth Server.

Direct mode requires network connectivity both:

- from the Teleport Proxy to the Windows Desktop Service.
- from the Windows Desktop Service to the Auth Service.

For these reasons direct mode is not available in Teleport cloud, only
self-hosted Teleport clusters.

### IoT mode (reverse tunnel)

In *IoT mode*, Windows Desktop Service only needs to be able to make an outbound
connection to a Teleport Proxy. The Windows Desktop Service establishes a
reverse tunnel to the proxy, and both registration with the Auth Server and
desktop sessions are performed over this tunnel. To enable this mode, ensure
that `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` is *unset*, and point
`teleport.proxy_server` at a Teleport Proxy.
