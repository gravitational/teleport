title: Desktop Access with Active Directory
description: Integrate the Teleport Desktop Service with your Active Directory domain

This guide will help you configure Teleport and Active Directory in order to
provide secure, passwordless access to Windows desktops.

<Admonition title="Azure AD" type="warning">

Microsoft's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) offering does not support the
Kerberos authentication protocol, which is required for Teleport's
certificate-based authentication.

At this time, Teleport does not support integration with Azure AD, however
Teleport Enterprise customers can access Windows desktops (including those
joined to Azure AD) using local accounts via the process described in [Getting
Started with Desktop Access](./getting-started.mdx).

</Admonition>

<Details title="Compare Desktop Access to other RDP clients">

The Teleport Desktop Service is designed to be a secure access solution for Windows
environments. Teleport implements a minimal feature set of the RDP protocol with
security as a priority, and may not be as performant as standard RDP clients.
Consider the Desktop Service to manage access to your most sensitive Windows
environments, not as a drop-in replacement for other tools to provide general
access to Windows desktops.

</Details>

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A server or virtual machine running a Windows Server operating system.
  In this guide, we'll install Active Directory on this server in order
  to support passwordless logins with Teleport to the Windows desktops
  in the Active Directory domain.
- A Linux host where you will run the Teleport Desktop Service.
- An Active Directory domain, configured for LDAPS (Teleport requires an
  encrypted LDAP connection). Typically this means installing
  [AD CS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-cs/).

## Step 1/2. Run the discovery wizard

In this step, you will use the Teleport Web UI to download and run two scripts:

- An Active Directory installation script to run on your Windows Server host
- An installation script for the Teleport Desktop Service, which you will run on
  your Linux host

### Install Active Directory

In your web browser, access the Teleport Web UI at the address of your Proxy
Service host, e.g., `example.teleport.sh`. Go to the Desktops section, then
select **Add Desktop**. Select **Active Directory** resource to start the guided
enrollment from the **Enroll New Resource** section.

If you already have Active Directory installed on your Windows Server host, skip
to the next step. Otherwise, copy and paste the first command provided into a
Windows PowerShell window on your Windows Server host. If you aren't already
running AD Certificate services, copy and paste the second command after the
first one completes and the server restarts:

![Install Active Directory](../../img/desktop-access/install-active-directory.png)

Once the server is restarted from one or both command executions, click **NEXT**.

Copy and paste the provided command into a Windows PowerShell window to download
and run the "configure Active Directory" script:

![Configure Active Directory](../../img/desktop-access/configure-active-directory.png)

Click **NEXT**.

The PowerShell script will output a Teleport configuration block. Copy this
block to a temporary location. Click **Next**.

### Install the Teleport Desktop Service

On the Linux host where you will run the Teleport Desktop Service, create a file
called `/etc/teleport.yaml` and paste the configuration provided by the output
of the previous step.

<Notice type="tip">

If you would like to run the Teleport Desktop Service from a Teleport process
that is already running other services, copy and paste only the
`windows_desktop_service` section.

</Notice>

The configuration file will resemble the following:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  auth_token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443

auth_service:
  enabled: no
ssh_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no

windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  ldap:
    addr: '10.10.1.50:636'
    domain: 'windows.teleport.example.com'
    username: 'WIN\svc-teleport'
    server_name: 'windows-server-hostname'
    # insecure_skip_verify prevents teleport from authenticating the LDAP CA
    # against the systems trust store.
    insecure_skip_verify: false
    ldap_ca_cert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

      ...
      31qA4dO3if7RdikD9hVbiIF9jQ==
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----

  discovery:
    base_dn: '*'
  labels:
    teleport.internal/resource-id: 42d8859c-60d0-4d7f-9767-bdd66b63fce6
```

Install the Teleport Desktop Service on your Linux host.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

In the Teleport Web UI, click **Next**.

## Step 2/2. Start Teleport

Once you've saved `/etc/teleport.yaml`, start Teleport:

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport Desktop Service"!)

The access wizard will detect when the new Teleport instance has joined the
cluster, and you can then click **Next**.

Teleport will discover available Windows desktops in the domain, and list them
under **Desktops**. Click **Finish** then **BROWSE EXISTING RESOURCES** to see them:

[Troubleshooting documentation](./troubleshooting.mdx) for common problems and
solutions.
