title: Dynamic Windows Desktop Registration
description: Register/unregister Windows desktops without restarting Teleport.
---

Dynamic Windows desktop registration allows Teleport administrators to register
new Windows desktops (or update/unregister existing ones) without having to
update the static configuration files read by Teleport Windows Desktop Service
instances.

Windows Desktop Service instances watch for updates from the Teleport Auth
Service for `dynamic_windows_desktop` resources, each of which includes the
information that the Windows Desktop Service needs to connect to a Windows
desktop.

## Required permissions

In order to interact with dynamically registered Windows desktops, a user must have
a Teleport role with permissions to manage `dynamic_windows_desktop` resources.

In the following example, a role allows a user to perform all possible
operations against `dynamic_windows_desktop` resources:

```yaml
allow:
  rules:
    - resources: [dynamic_windows_desktop]
      verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
```

## Enabling dynamic registration

To enable dynamic registration, include a `resources` section in your Windows Desktop
Service configuration with a list of resource label selectors you'd like this
service to monitor for registering:

```yaml
windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

You can use a wildcard selector to register all dynamic Windows desktop resources in the cluster
on the Windows Desktop Service or provide a specific set of labels for a subset:

```yaml
resources:
- labels:
    "env": "prod"
- labels:
    "env": "test"
```

## Creating a dynamic_windows_desktop resource

Configure Teleport to register a Windows desktop dynamically by creating an `dynamic_windows_desktop`
resource. The following example configures Teleport for connecting to Windows desktop
called `example` at `host1.example.com:3089`.

```yaml
kind: dynamic_windows_desktop
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example
  description: "Example desktop"
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  addr: host1.example.com:3089
  # non_ad should be true for logging with local Windows user and false for Active Directory users
  non_ad: true
  # domain specifies domain used for AD-joined machines
  domain: ""

  # Optional - ensures that all sessions use the same screen size,
  # no matter what the size of the browser window is.
  # Leave blank to use the size of the browser window.
  screen_size:
    width: 1024
    height: 768
```

The user creating the dynamic Windows desktop needs to have a role with access
to the Windows desktop labels and the `dynamic_windows_desktop` resource. In
this example role the user can only create and maintain dynamic Windows desktops
labeled `env: test`.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  allow:
    windows_desktop_labels:
      env: test
    rules:
    - resources: [dynamic_windows_desktop]
      verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
```

To create a dynamic Windows desktop resource, run:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

        ```code
        # Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
        # You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
        # first.
        $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
        $ tctl create dynamic_windows_desktop.yaml
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise (Cloud)">

        ```code
        # Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
        $ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=myuser
        $ tctl create dynamic_windows_desktop.yaml
        ```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

After the resource has been created, it will appear among the list of available
Windows desktops (in the web UI) as long as at least one Windows Desktop Service
instance picks it up according to its label selectors.

To update an existing dynamic Windows desktop resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create -f dynamic_windows_desktop.yaml
```

If the updated resource's labels no longer match a particular Windows Desktop Service, it
will unregister and stop routing traffic to it.

To delete a dynamic Windows desktop resource, run:

```code
$ tctl rm dynamic_windows_desktop/example
```
