title: Troubleshooting Server Access
description: Describes common issues and solutions for access to servers.
---

This section describes common issues that you might encounter in managing access to servers
with Teleport and how to work around or resolve them.

## Starting SSH sessions fails

When you start a new SSH session, Teleport forks itself and the child process
runs as the OS user who is attempting to connect. If the file system permissions
on the `teleport` binary don't include execute permissions for this user, the
session fails to start.

This issue could be caused by systems that prevent newly installed software from
being executable by any user.

### Symptom

This issue results in a disconnected session and an error message similar to the following:

```text
Failed to launch: fork/exec /proc/self/exe: permission denied.
Process exited with status 255
```

### Solution

You should check the permission settings for the `teleport` binary.

To check the file system permissions on the `teleport` binary:

1. Open a terminal shell on the computer where you have installed the `teleport` service.

1. Determine the location and file system permission of the Teleport binary by running the following command:

   ```code
   ls -al $(which teleport)
   ```

   The command should return output similar to the following:

   ```text
   -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  531849504 Aug 30 18:32 /usr/local/bin/teleport
   ```

   If you don't see the permission that allows other users to read and execute (-rwxr-x**r-x**),
   you should update the permissions. For example:

   ```code
   sudo chmod go+rx $(which teleport)
   ```

1. Restart the `teleport` service.

## Missing logins for single sign-on users

If you use an external identity provider to enable single sign-on for users, you should be sure
to assign logins for those users.

### Symptom

Users who have access to Teleport through an authentication connector for an external identity
provider don't see any of the logins they need to access remote resources.

### Solution

To fix this issue, you should check that the configuration of your auth connectors assigns logins to
your single sign-on users or modify the traits in the Teleport roles assigned to users through their
group membership in the external identity provider.
For more information about using traits in roles, see [Role Templates](../../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx).

## Offline servers are included in the server list

In some cases,  running `tsh ls` or `tctl nodes ls` commands might include servers that are offline.
For example, a server that has stopped sending a heartbeat to the Teleport Proxy Service
might continue to be listed as available in the output of `tsh ls` or `tctl nodes ls` commands for
10 minutes or more.

### Symptom

An unresponsive server is listed as available in the output of `tsh ls` or `tctl nodes ls` commands.
For example, you might run either of these commands and see output similar to the following for
servers that have previously sent a heartbeat signal to the Teleport Proxy Service even if
one of these servers subsequently went offline:

```
Node Name      Address        Labels
-------------- -------------- -----------------------
ip-172-3-1-242 127.0.0.1:3022 hostname=ip-172-3-1-242
ip-172-3-1-75  ⟵ Tunnel       hostname=ip-172-3-1-75
ip-172-3-2-177 ⟵ Tunnel       hostname=ip-172-3-2-177
```

### Solution

To investigate whether a server that previously sent a heartbeat has become unresponsive, you can run the
`tsh ls` or `tctl nodes ls` command with the `--format json` command-line option to see additional
information, including an expiration time. For example:

```json
    "kind": "node",
    "version": "v2",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "c78612d9-dab4-497f-a4d8-59ddb7edc6e9",
      "labels": {
        "teleport.internal/resource-id": "3547a530-3b58-4f65-8335-c5cf99c7b374"
      },
      "expires": "2023-09-15T21:40:17.653190645Z",
      "id": 1694813417653574518
    },
```

If the server sends a regular heartbeat signal, the `expires` value should remain relatively consistent,
for example, eight to ten minutes from the current time. If the time to expire is less than the typical
expiration time—for example, within the next two or three minutes from the current time—it's likely that
the server has stopped sending the heartbeat.

## Unable to join a shared session

Teleport allows multiple users to observe or participate in active sessions. You can define rules and
configure role-based policies to control which users can join other users' sessions from `tsh` and the
Teleport Web UI. If you are unable to join a shared session, you should check your role assignments
and ensure you have a role that include the `join_session` permission.
For example:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: auditor
version: v6
spec:
  allow:
    join_sessions:
      - name: Join prod sessions
        roles : ['prod-access']
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator', 'observer']
```

For more information about moderated sessions and session sharing, see
[Joining Sessions](../../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/joining-sessions.mdx).

## Unable to connect to agentless OpenSSH server as root

You should check your sshd configuration in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for a setting like
`PermitRootLogin no` or `PermitRootLogin forced-commands-only` - either of these
settings will prevent login as root.
If you wish to log in as root to an OpenSSH server via Teleport, we recommend
changing this setting to `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`.

You will need to restart sshd for the change to take effect:
```code
$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
