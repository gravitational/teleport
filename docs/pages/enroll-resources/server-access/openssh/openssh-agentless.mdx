In this guide, we will show you how to configure Teleport in agentless mode and
have the OpenSSH server `sshd` join a Teleport cluster. Existing fleets of
OpenSSH servers can be configured to accept SSH certificates dynamically issued
by a Teleport CA.

Using Teleport and OpenSSH has the advantage of getting you up
and running, but in the long run, we would recommend replacing `sshd` with `teleport`.
`teleport` SSH servers have support for multiple features that are incompatible with OpenSSH:

- RBAC and resource filtering based on [dynamically updated labels](../../../admin-guides/management/admin/labels.mdx)
- [Session recording without SSH connection termination](../guides/recording-proxy-mode.mdx)
- [Session sharing](../../../connect-your-client/tsh.mdx)
- [Advanced session recording](../guides/bpf-session-recording.mdx)

## How it works

Teleport supports OpenSSH by proxying SSH connections through the Proxy Service. When a Teleport user requests to connect to an OpenSSH node, the Proxy Service checks the user's Teleport roles.

If the RBAC checks succeed, the Proxy Service authenticates to the OpenSSH node with a dynamically generated certificate signed by a Teleport CA. This allows the
Proxy Service to record and audit connections to OpenSSH nodes.

The Proxy Service prevents Teleport users from bypassing auditing by requiring
a certificate signed by a Teleport CA that only the Auth Service possesses.

In this setup, the Teleport SSH Service performs RBAC checks as well as audits and records sessions on its host, which eliminates the need for connection termination when recording SSH sessions.

  Registering an OpenSSH node with Teleport involves copying the `teleport` binary
  onto your `sshd` host. The `teleport` binary will handle registering the node
  with your cluster, generating certificates, modifying your OpenSSH `sshd` config,
  and more. If copying the `teleport` binary onto your `sshd` and running it isn't
  an option, you can [register your node manually instead](openssh-manual-install.mdx).

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- OpenSSH version 6.9 or above on your local machine. View your OpenSSH version
  with the command:

  ```code
  $ ssh -V
  ```

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux host with the OpenSSH server `sshd` version 7.4 or above installed,
  but not Teleport. The SSH port on this host must be open to traffic from the
  Teleport Proxy Service host.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

### Upgrading to v14 from legacy OpenSSH nodes

  If you have previously configured OpenSSH nodes to trust a Teleport CA without
  registering them and you upgrade your Teleport cluster to Teleport 14, you won't
  be able to connect to them anymore by default. This is because open dialing to
  OpenSSH servers not registered with the cluster is no longer allowed in Teleport 14.
  To ensure that you will retain access to your OpenSSH nodes you will need to follow
  this guide to register every OpenSSH node with Teleport that you previously
  configured. This must be done *before* your Teleport cluster is upgraded to Teleport 14.

  If you are having issues registering OpenSSH nodes or need to upgrade your
  Teleport cluster to Teleport 14 before registering all of your OpenSSH nodes, you can
  pass the `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_UNLISTED_AGENT_DIALING` environment variable to your
  Proxy Service and set it to `yes`. This will allow connections to unregistered
  OpenSSH nodes but will be removed in Teleport v15.

## Step 1/3. Configure `sshd`

Teleport only allows access to resources in your infrastructure via Teleport
processes that that have joined the cluster.

To register the OpenSSH node, you must have a valid auth token to connect to the cluster.
You can generate the token by running the following command against your Teleport Auth Service:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=node --format=text
(=presets.tokens.first=)
```

Copy the `teleport` binary to your `sshd` host. Configure `sshd` and create a node
resource on your cluster with the following command:

```code
$ sudo teleport join openssh \
  --address <Var name="server1.example.com:22" /> \
  --proxy-server <Var name="teleport.example.com:443" /> \
  --join-method token \
  --token <Var name="(=presets.tokens.first=)" /> \
  --labels env=dev
```

Change the command-line options to assign the following values:
- <Var name="server1.example.com:22" /> Set to the address and port of the node that will join your Teleport cluster.
- <Var name="teleport.example.com:443" /> Set to the address and port of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- <Var name="(=presets.tokens.first=)" /> Set to the join token value.

Check that your new node is listed with `tsh ls` or in the Web UI.

You can edit the node with `tctl edit nodes/<hostname>` or
`tctl edit nodes/<UUID>`. The node's UUID can be found in the output of
`tctl nodes ls -v`. Be careful when changing the node's hostname, as the
hostname is a principal embedded in the host certificate that was generated
with `teleport join openssh`. If you want to modify the node's hostname,
you should either change the hostname of the instance and re-run
`teleport join openssh`, or manually issue a new host certificate with
`tctl auth sign --format=openssh`.

After you've confirmed the node was registered successfully you can delete the
copied `teleport` binary.

## Step 2/3. Generate an SSH client configuration

The next step is to configure your OpenSSH client to connect to your `sshd` host
using credentials managed by Teleport. This configuration will use your user's
Teleport-issued certificate to authenticate to the `sshd` host. It will also
authenticate the `sshd` host using the host certificate you generated earlier.

First, make sure you have logged in to your Teleport cluster:

On your local machine, run the following `tsh` command. This will print a
configuration block that tells your SSH client to use credentials managed by
Teleport to connect to hosts in your cluster.

```code
$ tsh config > ssh_config_teleport
```

This command creates an SSH configuration file at a nonstandard location in
order to make it easier to clean up, but you can append the output of
`tsh config` to the default SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`) if you wish.


<details>
<summary>How does the config work?</summary>

Teleport implements an SSH server that includes several **subsystems**, or
predefined commands that are run when the server handles a connection. The Proxy
Service implements a `proxy` subsystem that forwards SSH traffic to remote hosts
and trusted clusters.

Here is a brief explanation of the configuration that `tsh config` generates:

```
# Common flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts
Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} {{ .ProxyHost }}
    UserKnownHostsFile "{{ .KnownHostsPath }}"
    IdentityFile "{{ .IdentityFilePath }}"
    CertificateFile "{{ .CertificateFilePath }}"
```

If the host you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster (i.e., its
address is a subdomain of your cluster's domain), use a Teleport-managed known
hosts file, private key, and certificate that are stored in the `.tsh`
directory.

```
# Flags for all {{ .ClusterName }} hosts except the proxy
Host *.{{ .ClusterName }} !{{ .ProxyHost }}
    Port 3022
    ProxyCommand "{{ .TSHPath }}" proxy ssh --cluster={{ .ClusterName }} --proxy={{ .ProxyHost }} %r@%h:%p
```

If the host that you are `ssh`ing into belongs to your Teleport cluster, the
OpenSSH client will first execute a command, the `ProxyCommand`, that
establishes an SSH connection to the Proxy Service. This command,
`tsh proxy ssh`, requests the `proxy` subsystem in order to forward SSH traffic
through the Proxy Service to your chosen host (including a host in a Trusted
Cluster).

The `tsh proxy ssh` command requests the `proxy` subsystem through a command
similar to the following, which assumes you are logging in to a node called
`mynode` as `root` with a cluster called `teleport.example.com`:

```code
$ /usr/bin/ssh -l root -A -o UserKnownHostsFile=/root/.tsh/known_hosts -p 11105 teleport.example.com -s proxy:mynode:3022@teleport.example.com
```

Notice that the `known_hosts` file used by the command is managed by `tsh`.
Since the `sshd` host's information is listed in this file, your SSH client can
authenticate the host via the certificate we generated earlier.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using PowerShell on Windows?</summary>

  If using PowerShell on Windows, note that normal shell redirection may write
  the file with the incorrect encoding. To ensure it's written properly, try the
  following:

  ```code
  $ tsh.exe config | out-file .ssh\config -encoding utf8 -append
  ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Dialing uppercase hostnames with OpenSSH</summary>
Routing in Teleport clusters is case-sensitive by default, but OpenSSH always lowercases hostnames. If you
are using an OpenSSH client and have hosts with uppercase letters in their hostnames, you may need to set
`case_insensitive_routing: true` in either the `auth_service` block of your Teleport config, or in the
`cluster_networking_config` resource.
</details>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Multiple Clusters"
>

  If you switch between multiple Teleport Proxy Servers, you'll need to re-run
  `tsh config` for each to generate the cluster-specific configuration.

  Similarly, if trusted clusters are added or removed, be sure to re-run
  `tsh config` and replace the previous configuration.

</Admonition>

## Step 3/3. Connect to your `sshd` host

Once you have appended the new text to your OpenSSH client configuration file,
you can log in to your `sshd` host using the configuration we generated earlier.

First, define environment variables for the address of your Teleport cluster,
the username you will use to log in to your `sshd` host, and the port on your
`sshd` host you are using for SSH traffic:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=teleport.example.com
$ PORT=22
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```code
# See the available logins you can use to access your sshd host
$ tsh status | grep Logins
Logins:             ubuntu, root
$ USER=ubuntu
$ CLUSTER=mytenant.teleport.sh
$ PORT=22
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, SSH in to your remote host:

```code
$ ssh -p ${PORT?} -F ssh_config_teleport "${USER?}@${ADDR?}.${CLUSTER?}"
```

This name does not need to be resolvable via DNS as the connection will be
routed through your Teleport Proxy Service.

<details>
<summary>Why are we overriding the port here?</summary>

By default, the OpenSSH client configuration generated by `tsh config` directs
the Teleport Proxy Service to dial port 3022 of a node in your Teleport cluster.
This works if the node's SSH Service is listening on port 3022, and means that
you can connect to the Teleport SSH Service via your OpenSSH client.

 When you join a Teleport node to a cluster, the node creates a reverse tunnel
 to the cluster's Proxy Service. When you run an `ssh` command to access a host
 in your Teleport cluster using the configuration we generated, the Teleport
 Proxy Service will attempt to connect to the host via this reverse tunnel and,
 if that fails, try directly dialing the address.

In our case, the `sshd` host is not running Teleport, so no reverse tunnel will
exist. Instead, the Proxy Service will establish a direct connection on the
host's SSH port.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using trusted clusters?</summary>

You can log in to a host in a trusted leaf cluster by placing the name of
the leaf cluster between the name of the node and the name of the root cluster:

```code
$ ssh -F ssh_config_teleport ${USER?}@node2.leafcluster.${CLUSTER}
```

</details>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Note"
>

  Teleport uses OpenSSH certificates instead of keys. When you connect to a
  remote host, OpenSSH verifies that the address of the host is listed under the
  `Principals` section of the OpenSSH certificate. Usually, this is a fully
  qualified domain name, rather than an IP address.
