With a Restricted Session, Teleport allows the administrator to specify a policy to
apply to SSH sessions. This policy can restrict access to certain resources. Currently
Teleport supports network restrictions with more types coming in the future.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Deprecation Warning">
Restricted Sessions for SSH were deprecated in Teleport 14 and will be removed
in Teleport 15.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- Linux kernel 5.8 (or above).

  You can check your kernel version using the `uname` command. The output should look
  something like the following.

  ```code
  $ uname -r
  # 5.8.17
  ```

### Linux distributions and supported kernels

<table>
<thead>
  <tr><td>Distro name</td><td>Distro version</td><td>Kernel version</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td>Ubuntu "Groovy Gorilla"</td><td>20.10</td><td>5.8+</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Fedora</td><td>33</td><td>5.8+</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Archlinux</td><td>2020.09.01</td><td>5.8.5+</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Flatcar</td><td>2765.2.2</td><td>5.10.25+</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Network restrictions

Network restrictions work similarly to a firewall but with several differences:

- Firewall rules apply to the entire machine whereas network restrictions are applied
   only to SSH sessions.
- Whereas firewall typically blocks ingress (inbound) connections, network restrictions
   block egress (outbound) connections.
- Firewall rules are typically static but Teleport provides an API for
   Restricted Sessions that allows the rules to be dynamically updated across
   the entire fleet.

## Step 1/4. Install and configure a Teleport Node

Set up your Teleport Node with the following content in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

<Notice type="warning">

  Restricted Sessions require Enhanced Recording to be enabled. This
  requirement will be removed in the future.

</Notice>

```yaml
# Example config to be saved as /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  nodename: graviton-node
  auth_token: exampletoken
  # Replace with the address of the Teleport Auth Server.
  auth_server: 127.0.0.1:3025
  data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
auth_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  enhanced_recording:
    # Must be enabled for Restricted Sessions to work.
    enabled: true
    # Optional: Controls where cgroupv2 hierarchy is mounted. Default value:
    # /cgroup2.
    cgroup_path: /cgroup2

  restricted_session:
    enabled: true
```

## Step 2/4. Define a network restrictions policy

Create a file called `netpolicy.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: network_restrictions
version: v4
metadata:
  name: network-restrictions
spec:
  # When Restricted Sessions are enabled, the network policy becomes
  # "deny-all". Must add back the ranges to allow
  allow:
    # Allow LAN access
    - cidr: 10.0.0.0/8
    - cidr: 172.16.0.0/12
    - cidr: 192.168.0.0/16

    # Allow link-local
    - cidr: 169.254.0.0/16
    - cidr: fe80::/10

    # Allow localhost
    - cidr: 127.0.0.0/8
    - cidr: ::1/128

  # Override "allow" list with exceptions
  deny:
    # Finance database
    - cidr: 10.1.2.4
```

Install the policy using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f netpolicy.yaml
# network restrictions have been updated
```

If Restricted Sessions are not enabled in `teleport.yaml`, all network
operations will be allowed. When Restricted Sessions are enabled but a
`network_restrictions` object has not been created via `tctl` or the API, the
default policy stays allow-all.

However when the `network_restrictions` object is created, the default policy
switches to deny-all. If you expect network operations to target certain
IP ranges, be sure to state these within the `allow` section.

## Step 3/4. Test Restricted Sessions

```code
$ curl -v https://google.com
# *   Trying 2607:f8b0:4005:809::200e:80...
# * TCP_NODELAY set
# * Immediate connect fail for 2607:f8b0:4005:809::200e: Operation not permitted
# *   Trying 172.217.6.78:80...
# * TCP_NODELAY set
# * Immediate connect fail for 172.217.6.78: Operation not permitted
# * Closing connection 0
# curl: (7) Couldn't connect to server
```

## Step 4/4. Inspect logs

The Teleport audit log will contain an entry with a `session.network` event (there may be
more entries present for the same `curl` command):

```json
{
  "ei": 173,
  "event": "session.network",
  "uid": "dda39eb4-13e1-45fd-a039-35b4dca1fa51",
  "code": "T4002I",
  "time": "2021-07-22T22:24:14.984Z",
  "cluster_name": "teleport-quickstart",
  "user": "demo",
  "login": "demo",
  "sid": "c8e0b0d5-3994-4221-b701-c1ae17d871f1",
  "namespace": "default",
  "server_id": "4951c001-8dad-4e21-abb6-c03f69b72d2e",
  "pid": 319267,
  "cgroup_id": 10863,
  "program": "curl",
  "src_addr": "0.0.0.0",
  "dst_addr": "216.58.194.206",
  "dst_port": 80,
  "version": 4,
  "operation": 0,
  "action": 1
}
```

This is the same event that is issued by Enhanced Recording. You can differentiate them by the `action` field.
Enhanced Recording sets the `action` to `0` (`OBSERVED`) while a Restricted Session sets this value to `1` (`DENIED`).

<Admonition type="tip">
  To quickly check the status of the audit log, you can simply tail the logs with
  `tail -f /var/lib/teleport/log/events.log`, the resulting capture from Teleport will
  be a JSON log for each command and network request.
