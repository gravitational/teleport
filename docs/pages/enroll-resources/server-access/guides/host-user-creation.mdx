title: Configure Teleport to Create Host Users
description: How to configure Teleport to automatically create transient host users.
---

Teleport's SSH Service can be configured to automatically create local Unix users
upon login.

This saves you from having to manually create users for each member of an
organization and provides more fine-grained control of permissions on a given
host. Host users created by Teleport are transient and will be deleted at the
end of an SSH session.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A running Linux server registered with Teleport. See the [Server Access
  Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.mdx) for how to add a server to your
  Teleport cluster. We recommend enrolling a server that runs in a demo
  environment for the purpose of this guide until you are familiar with the
  instructions.
- The following utilities should be available in the PATH for the Teleport SSH
  Service, since it must execute these commands in order to create transient
  users:
  - `useradd`
  - `userdel`
  - `usermod`
  - `groupadd`
  - `getent`
  - `visudo`
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Automatic host users

In this section, you will configure Teleport to create local users when a
Teleport user starts an SSH session.

### Step 1/4. Configure RBAC

When a Teleport user accesses an SSH Service instance, Teleport checks each of
the user's roles that match the instance. If at least one role matches the
instance but does not set `create_host_user_mode`, automatic user creation will
be disabled. Roles that do not match the server will not be checked.

To enable host user creation, you will:

- Label your server so you can match it with a Teleport role that enables host
  user creation.
- Create a role that enables host user creation for servers with the label you
  added.
- For the purpose of this guide, create a Teleport user with only the role you
  created.

#### Label your server

1. Access the server you enrolled with Teleport before beginning this guide and
   open the Teleport configuration file, which is `/etc/teleport.yaml` by
   default.

1. Make the following change to the configuration file:

   ```diff
     labels:
   +   app: "nginx"
   ```

1. Restart Teleport on the server.

#### Define a Teleport role

The following role specification allows users to log in as `nginxrestarter` on
any matching server. Add this content to a file called `auto-users.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: auto-users
spec:
  options:
    # Allow automatic creation of users.
    create_host_user_mode: keep
    create_host_user_default_shell: /bin/bash
  allow:
    logins: [ "nginxrestarter" ]
    # List of host groups the created user will be added to. Any that don't already exist are created.
    host_groups: [ubuntu, nginx, other]
    # List of entries to include in a temporary sudoers file created in /etc/sudoers.d
    host_sudoers: [
       # This line will allow the `nginxrestarter` user to run
       # `systemctl restart nginx.service` as
       # root without requiring a password.
       # The sudoers entries will be prefixed with `nginxrestarter` in this case.
       # sudoers file reference documentation: https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/1.8.17/sudoers.man/
       "ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx.service"
    ]
    node_labels:
      "app": "nginx"
```

The `create_host_user_mode` field enables host user creation when the value is
`keep`.  When a user with the `auto-users` role logs in to a server that matches
the `app:nginx` label, the Teleport SSH Service creates a host user, adds it to
the groups listed in `host_groups`, and gives it the sudoer permissions
specified in the `host_sudoers` field. In this case, the new user receives
permission to restart the Nginx service as root. In Teleport 16.4.0 and later,
the default shell for a created user can be configured with `create_host_user_default_shell`. 
Otherwise the host's default shell will be used.

{/*TODO (ptgott): We should move the information below into a reference guide*/}
<Details title="Customizing host user creation">

Each value of the `logins` field must conform to the username requirements of
the Linux distribution being used. See [User/Group Name
Syntax](https://systemd.io/USER_NAMES/) for requirements in common
distributions.

When multiple roles contain `host_sudoers` entries, the sudoers file
will have the entries written to it ordered by role name

If a role includes a `deny` rule that sets `host_sudoers` to `'*'`, the user will
have all sudoers entries removed when accessing matching Nodes, otherwise `deny`
rules are matched literally when filtering:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: auto-users
spec:
  options:
    create_host_user_mode: keep
  deny:
    host_sudoers: [
       "*" # ensure that users in this role never have sudoers files created on matching Nodes
       "ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" # host_sudoers entries matching this are filtered out
    ]
    node_labels:
      "app": "nginx"
```

If a server must never allow the automatic creation of transient Unix users you
can set `disable_create_host_user` to `true` in the Node's configuration:

```yaml
# teleport.yaml
teleport:
  nodename: node
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
  # Disable automatic host user creation on this Node, regardless of role permissions.
  disable_create_host_user: true
```

In low-security environments, you can also set `create_host_user_mode` to
`insecure-drop`, which deletes users once the session ends. However, in this
mode it is possible for a created user to get the same UID as a previously
deleted user, which would give the new user access to all of the old user's
files if they are not deleted. Use `keep` mode unless you really need users to
be removed.

</Details>

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f auto-users.yaml
# role 'auto-users' has been created
```

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

#### Create a Teleport user

1. Run the following command to create a Teleport user with the `auto-users`
   role:

   ```code
   $ tctl users add demo-user --roles=auto-users --logins=nginxrestarter
   ```

1. Follow the instructions in your terminal to visit the Teleport Web UI and
   create the user.

### Step 2/4. [Optional] Configure the UID and GID for the created users

If the user has the `host_user_uid` and `host_user_gid` traits
specified, when the host user is being created the UID and GID will be
set to those values.

These values can either be set manually when creating or updating the
user through `tctl`, or it can be set via SSO attributes of the same
name.

If a group with the specified GID does not already exist, a group will
be created with the same login name as the user being created.

```yaml
kind: user
metadata:
  name: demo-user
spec:
  ...
  traits:
    logins:
    - nginxrestarter
    host_user_gid:
    # gid and uid values must be quoted.
    - "1234"
    host_user_uid:
    - "5678"
```

<Admonition type="warning">

If multiple entries are specified in the `host_user_uid` or `host_user_gid` only the first entry will be used.

</Admonition>

For Teleport users that don't have a `host_user_uid` trait, starting from Teleport 17.3, it's possible to configure the cluster to assign the same UID for any given username for automatically created host users across all Teleport SSH instances.

Edit your cluster authentication preference using the following command:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_auth_preference
```

In your editor, ensure that your `cluster_auth_preference` includes a `stable_unix_user_config` field similar to the following:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
version: v2
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  # ...
  stable_unix_user_config:
    enabled: true
    first_uid: 90000
    last_uid: 95000
```

The range of UIDs between `first_uid` and `last_uid` (inclusive) will be used by Teleport to assign UIDs for new users, and you should make sure it's not a range of UIDs already in use by other services or workloads across your fleet of servers. While UID allocations in Linux can vary, we recommend sticking to one of the available ranges listed in the [systemd documentation for "Users, Groups, UIDs and GIDs on systemd Systems"](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/docs/UIDS-GIDS.md).

Once enabled, all Teleport SSH instances (of version 17.3 and newer) will use the UID provided by the control plane when automatically creating a new host user, if no other UID is specified by the user trait and if the `create_host_user_mode` is `keep` (and not `insecure-drop`).

You can inspect the list of assigned UIDs with the following command:

```code
$ tctl stable-unix-users ls
```

### Step 3/4. Configure sudoers on your Linux servers

Teleport host user creation leverages the `sudoers.d` directory for new users. 
For CentOS builds, ensure that the following line is present in your sudoers file. Ignore for any other Linux distros:

```bash
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
```

In the sudoers file, the `#` symbol is typically used to indicate comments. However, 
in this context, `#includedir` is a directive and not a comment.

For Debian-based systems, you might encounter `@includedir /etc/sudoers.d`, 
which serves a similar purpose. Ensure that the correct directive is used based on your operating system.

### Step 4/4 Test host user creation

When you connect to a remote Node via `tsh`, and host user creation is enabled, the
Teleport SSH Service will automatically create a user on the host:

```code
$ tsh login
$ tsh ssh nginxrestarter@develnode
$ grep "nginxrestarter" /etc/passwd
# nginxrestarter:x:1001:1003::/home/nginxrestarter:/bin/bash
$ grep "other" /etc/group
# other:x:1002:nginxrestarter
$ exit
$ tsh ssh admin@develnode # checking the user was deleted after logout
$ grep "nginxrestarter" /etc/passwd
$ echo $?
# 1
```

When the user above logs in, the `nginxrestarter` user and any groups that do
not already exist are created on the host. The `nginxrestarter` user is added to
the `ubuntu`, `nginx`, and `other` groups, as specified in the `host_groups`
field.

## Static host users

In this section, you will configure Teleport to create local users independently
of an SSH session. Static host users require Teleport version >=16.3.0 on auth
servers, SSH services, and `tctl`.

### Step 1/3. Configure RBAC

#### Label your server

1. Access the server you enrolled with Teleport before beginning this guide and
   open the Teleport configuration file, which is `/etc/teleport.yaml` by
   default.

1. Make the following change to the configuration file:

   ```diff
     labels:
   +   app: "nginx"
   ```

1. Restart Teleport on the server.

#### Define a Teleport role

The following role specification allows users to log in as `nginxrestarter` on
any matching server. Add this content to a file called `auto-users.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: auto-users
spec:
  allow:
    logins: ["nginxrestarter"]
    node_labels:
      "app": "nginx"
```

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f auto-users.yaml
# role 'auto-users' has been created
```

#### Create a Teleport user

1. Run the following command to create a Teleport user with the `auto-users`
   role:

   ```code
   $ tctl users add demo-user --roles=auto-users --logins=nginxrestarter
   ```

1. Follow the instructions in your terminal to visit the Teleport Web UI and
   create the user.

### Step 2/3. Create the static host user

Add this content to a file called `nginxrestarter.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: static_host_user
metadata:
  name: nginxrestarter
spec:
  matchers:
    # Use either node_labels or node_labels_expression to select which servers
    # to create the host user on. Only one is required.
    - node_labels:
      - name: app
        values: ["nginx"]
      node_labels_expression: 'labels["app"] == "nginx"'
      # List of host groups the created user will be added to. Any that don't already exist are created.
      groups: [ubuntu, nginx, other]
      # List of entries to include in a temporary sudoers file created in /etc/sudoers.d
      sudoers: [
        # This line will allow the `nginxrestarter` user to run
        # `systemctl restart nginx.service` as
        # root without requiring a password.
        # The sudoers entries will be prefixed with `nginxrestarter` in this case.
        # sudoers file reference documentation: https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/1.8.17/sudoers.man/
        "ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx.service"
      ]
      # UID of the host user. Optional.
      # uid: 1234
      # GID of the host user. Optional.
      # gid: 1234
      # Default shell for the created user. Optional.
      # default_shell: /bin/bash
      # Whether or not static host user provisioning should automatically take ownership of existing users
      # created outside of Teleport. Optional.
      # take_ownership_if_user_exists: true

    # Add additional matchers if needed to configure nginxrestarter differently
    # on different servers.
    # - node_labels:
      # ...
```

The name of the static host user resource must match the login of the user to
be created. A server will only provision the user if a single defined matcher is
satisfied. If there are multiple matches for a single static host user resource,
or if the user already exists and `take_ownership_if_user_exists` is not set to
`true`, then the server will refuse to provision the user. 

Create the static host user:

```code
$ tctl create -f nginxrestarter.yaml
# static_host_user 'nginxrestarter' has been created
```

<Admonition type="note">

Deleting the static host user resource does not remove the host user from any
servers it has been applied to.

</Admonition>

### Step 3/3. Test

Connect to the remote Node via `tsh` to verify that the host user was created:

```code
$ tsh login
$ tsh ssh nginxrestarter@develnode
$ grep "nginxrestarter" /etc/passwd
# nginxrestarter:x:1001:1003::/home/nginxrestarter:/bin/bash
$ grep "other" /etc/group
# other:x:1002:nginxrestarter
```

## Under the hood

The Teleport SSH Service executes `useradd` to create new users on the host, and
returns an error if it cannot find the `useradd` binary. The `useradd` command
adds the user to the groups specified in the Teleport user's roles, and Teleport
separately creates a new home directory with the name of the new host user.

The SSH Service executes
`useradd --no-create-home --home-dir <home> <username> --groups <groups> --uid <uid> --gid <gid>`
when adding a user, with all other options using system defaults. For example, it associates the user with the
default login shell for the host, which you can specify by setting the `SHELL`
field in `/etc/default/useradd`. See the `useradd` manual for your system for a
full description of the default behavior.

The Teleport SSH Service also creates a file in `/etc/sudoers.d` with the
contents of the `host_sudoers` file written with one entry per line, each
prefixed with the username of the user that has logged in.

The session can then proceed as usual. When the SSH session ends, the user
and their home directory will be kept on the machine. It is possible to remove automatic host users
by setting `create_host_user_mode` to `insecure-drop` in the role definition. However,
the potential for a user id to be reused on the system opens up a number of potential security risks,
so we recommend using `keep` mode unless you have a specific need and understand
the potential impacts.

Should a Teleport SSH instance be restarted while a session is in progress, the user
will be cleaned up at the next Teleport restart.

## Migrating unmanaged users

### `keep` mode users from previous versions of Teleport
Automatic host users created with `create_host_user_mode: keep` prior to `v14.3.24`, `v15.4.16`, and `v16.1.8`
will not be managed by later versions of Teleport. In order to migrate these users automatically on their next
session, you can add `teleport-keep` to your role's `host_groups`. Host users can also be migrated manually by adding
them to the `teleport-keep` group directly on the hosts you wish to migrate.

### Static host users
By default, static host user provisioning will not take ownership of any existing users created outside of Teleport.
In order to configure Teleport to automatically take ownership of any unmanaged users that collide with a static host
user, the `take_ownership_if_user_exists` flag can be set to `true` on the static host user resource. This will bring
the existing user under Teleport's management and override the groups assigned to that user. Similar to migrating
`teleport-keep` users, it is possible to migrate users manually by adding them to the `teleport-static` group directly
on the hosts.

## Next steps

- Configure automatic user provisioning for [Database Access](../../database-access/auto-user-provisioning/auto-user-provisioning.mdx).
- Configure automatic user provisioning for [desktop access](../../../reference/agent-services/desktop-access-reference/user-creation.mdx).
- Configure automatic user provisioning with [Terraform](../../../reference/terraform-provider/resources/role.mdx).
Note when using the terraform provider that some values may be different than described in this guide.
