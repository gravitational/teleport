## Prerequisites

- (!docs/pages/enroll-resources/server-access/guides/encrypted-session-recordings/encrypted-session-recordings.mdx!)

Although Manual Key Management leaves key rotation entirely up to the
administrator, the `manual_key_management` configuration can be leveraged to help facilitate rotations.

As an example, we will assume an existing Teleport Auth Service configured to
use a PKCS#11 compatible HSM with an active key identified by the label
`session_recording_001`:

<Admonition type="note">
All configuration examples are reduced to the `encryption` configuration block
for brevity since the available options are identical between the Teleport Auth
Service configuration file and the dynamic `session_recording_config` resource.
</Admonition>

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: yes
  manual_key_management:
    enabled: yes
    active_keys:
      - type: pkcs11
        label: 'session_recordings_001'
```

## Step 1/2. Add the new key

A new key can be added to the the list of active keys:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: yes
  manual_key_management:
    enabled: yes
    active_keys:
      - type: pkcs11
        label: 'session_recordings_002'
      - type: pkcs11
        label: 'session_recordings_001'
```

This configuration expects a second key to be accessible using the
`session_recordings_002` label. Teleport maintains a cache of references to
accessible keys that is periodically updated, but it is best practice to ensure
the key exists prior to updating the `manual_key_management` configuration.

## Step 2/2. Rotate the old key

The old key can be moved out of the active set of encryption keys and into the
set of rotated keys:

```yaml
encryption:
  enabled: yes
  manual_key_management:
    enabled: yes
    active_keys:
      - type: pkcs11
        label: 'session_recordings_002'
    rotated_keys:
      - type: pkcs11
        label: 'session_recordings_001'
```

All new recordings will now be encrypted using the key labeled by
`session_recordings_002`, and historical recordings encrypted using
`session_recordings_001` will remain replayable.
