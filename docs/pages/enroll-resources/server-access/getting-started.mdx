You can protect a server with Teleport by running the Teleport SSH Service on
the server and enrolling it in your Teleport cluster. 

This guides shows you how to:

- Enroll a server in your Teleport cluster.
- SSH into a server using Teleport.
- Inspect server resources in the cluster using Teleport commands.

## How it works

The Teleport SSH Service opens a reverse SSH tunnel to the Teleport Proxy
Service, and SSH client traffic uses this tunnel to connect to a server. This
setup is similar to the [bastion
pattern](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-bastion-host/).

Once a server has joined your cluster, the Teleport RBAC system enforces
secure access to the server, and administrators can identify security threats
using the Teleport audit log.

You can use Teleport to enable secure access to a Kubernetes node. To do so,
modify your node's machine image to install and run the Teleport SSH Service as
per the instructions in this guide. Do not run the SSH Service as a Kubernetes
pod, as there is no guarantee that the SSH Service pod is running on a server
that a user intends to access.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- One host running a Linux environment (such as Ubuntu 20.04, CentOS 8.0, or
  Debian 10). This will serve as a Teleport Node.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/permission-warning.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Install Teleport on your Linux host

1. Your Linux host will be a private resource. Open port 22 so you can initially
   access, configure, and provision your instance.

   We'll configure and launch our instance, then demonstrate how to use the
   `tsh` tool and Teleport in SSH mode.

1. On the host where you will run the Teleport SSH Service, follow the instructions
   for your environment to install Teleport.

   (!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

   Next, we'll create a **join token** so you can start the Teleport SSH Service
   and add it to your cluster.

## Step 2/4. Add a server to the cluster

### Create a join token

On your local workstation, create a join token so you can add the server to your
Teleport cluster:

```code
Let's save the token to a file
$ tctl tokens add --type=node --format=text > token.file
```

`--type=node` specifies that the Teleport process will act and join as an SSH
server.

`> token.file` indicates that you'd like to save the output to a file name `token.file`.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tip">
This helps to minimize the direct sharing of tokens even when they are dynamically generated.
</Admonition>

### Join your server to the cluster

On your server, save `token.file` to an appropriate, secure, directory you have
the rights and access to read. Next, generate a configuration file enabling
Teleport's SSH Service.

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

Change `tele.example.com` to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service. Assign
the `--token` flag to the path where you saved `token.file`.

```code
# Generate config
$ sudo teleport node configure \
   --output=file:///etc/teleport.yaml \
   --token=/path/to/token.file \
   --proxy=tele.example.com:443
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

 Change `mytenant.teleport.sh` to your Teleport Cloud tenant address. Assign the
 `--token` flag to the path where you saved `token.file`.

```code
# Generate config
$ sudo teleport node configure \
   --output=file:///etc/teleport.yaml \
   --token=/path/to/token.file \
   --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh:443
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

The `teleport node configure` command above placed a configuration file at
`/etc/teleport.yaml`. The last step is to start Teleport, pointing it at this
configuration:

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport SSH Service"!)

### Access the Web UI

Run the following command to create a local user that can access the Teleport
Web UI:

```code
$ tctl users add myuser --roles=editor,access --logins=root,ubuntu,ec2-user
```

This will generate an initial login link where you can create a password and set
up multi-factor authentication for `myuser`.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
We've only given `myuser` the roles `editor` and `access` according to the
Principle of Least Privilege.
</Admonition>

You should now be able to view your server in the Teleport Web UI after
logging in as `myuser`:

![Both servers in the Web UI](../../../img/server-access/teleport_ui.png)

## Step 3/4. SSH into the server

Now that we've got our cluster up and running, let's see how easy it is to
connect to our server.

We can use `tsh` to SSH into the cluster:

### Log in to the cluster

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

On your local machine, log in to your cluster through `tsh`, assigning the
`--proxy` flag to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```code
# Log in through tsh
$ tsh login --proxy=tele.example.com --user=myuser
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

On your local machine, log in to your cluster through `tsh`, assigning the
`--proxy` flag to the address of your Teleport Cloud tenant:

```code
# Log in through tsh
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh:443 --user=myuser
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

You'll be prompted to supply the password and authentication factor we set up
previously.

`myuser` will now see something similar to:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

```txt
> Profile URL:      https://tele.example.com:443
Logged in as:       myuser
Cluster:            tele.example.com
Roles:              access, editor
Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
Kubernetes:         disabled
Valid until:        2021-04-30 06:39:13 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

In this example, `myuser` is now logged into the `tele.example.com` cluster
through Teleport SSH.

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```txt
> Profile URL:        https://mytenant.teleport.sh:443
Logged in as:       myuser
Cluster:            mytenant.teleport.sh
Roles:              access, editor
Logins:             root, ubuntu, ec2-user
Kubernetes:         disabled
Valid until:        2021-04-30 06:39:13 -0500 CDT [valid for 12h0m0s]
Extensions:         permit-agent-forwarding, permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty
```

In this example, `myuser` is now logged into the `mytenant.teleport.sh`
cluster through Teleport SSH.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Display cluster resources

`myuser` can now execute the following to find the cluster's server names,
which are used for establishing SSH connections:

   ```code
   # Display cluster resources
   $ tsh ls
   ```

   In this example, the bastion host is located on the bottom line below:

   ```txt
   Node Name        Address        Labels
   ---------------- -------------- --------------------------------------
   ip-172-31-35-170 ⟵ Tunnel
   ip-172-31-41-144 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example, hostname=ip-172-31-41-144
   ```

### Connect to a server

`myuser` can SSH into the bastion host server by running the following command locally:

```code
# Use tsh to ssh into a server
$ tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-41-144
```

Now, they can:

- Connect to other servers in the cluster by using the appropriate IP address in
  the `tsh ssh` command.
- Traverse the Linux file system.
- Execute desired commands.

All commands executed by `myuser` are recorded and can be replayed in the
Teleport Web UI.

The `tsh ssh` command allows users to do anything they could if they were to SSH
into a server using a third-party tool. Compare the two equivalent commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="tsh">

    ```code
    $ tsh ssh root@ip-172-31-41-144
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="ssh">

  To use the `ssh` client generate a SSH configuration file and postfix
  the cluster name after the node name.

    ```code
    $ tsh config > ssh_config_teleport
    $ ssh -F ssh_config_teleport root@ip-172-31-41-144.example.teleport.sh
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 4/4. Use tsh and the unified resource catalog to introspect the cluster

Now, `myuser` has the ability to SSH into other servers within the cluster,
traverse the Linux file system, and execute commands.

- They have visibility into all resources within the cluster due to their
  defined and assigned roles.
- They can also quickly view any server or grouping of servers that have been
  assigned a particular label.

### Display the unified resource catalog

Execute the following command within your bastion host console:

```code
# List servers
$ tctl nodes ls
```

This displays the unified resource catalog with all queried resources in one
view:

```txt
Nodename         UUID                                 Address        Labels
---------------- ------------------------------------ -------------- -------------------------------------
ip-172-31-35-170 4980899c-d260-414f-9aea-874feef71747
ip-172-31-41-144 f3d2a65f-3fa7-451d-b516-68d189ff9ae5 127.0.0.1:3022 env=example,hostname=ip-172-31-41-144
```

Note the "Labels" column on the farthest side. `myuser` can query all
resources with a shared label using the command:

```code
# Query all servers with a label
$ tsh ls env=example
```

Customized labels can be defined in your `teleport.yaml` configuration file or
during server creation.

This is a convenient feature that allows for more advanced queries. If an IP
address changes, for example, an admin can quickly find the current server with
that label since it remains unchanged.

### Run commands on all servers with a label

`myuser` can also execute commands on all servers that share a label, vastly
simplifying repeated operations. For example, the following command will execute
the `ls` command on each server and display the results in your terminal:

```code
# Run the ls command on all servers with a label
$ tsh ssh root@env=example ls
```

## Optional: Harden your server

We previously configured our Linux instance to leave port `22` open to easily
configure and install Teleport. Feel free to compare Teleport SSH to your usual
`ssh` commands.

To harden your Teleport server:

- Close port `22` on your private Linux instance now that your Teleport server is
  configured and running.
- For self-hosted deployments, optionally close port `22` on your Proxy Service
  host.
- You'll be able to fully connect to the private instance and, for self-hosted
  deployments, the Proxy Service host, using `tsh ssh`.

## Conclusion

To recap, this guide described:

- How to set up and add an SSH server to a cluster.
- Connect to the cluster using `tsh` to manage and introspect resources.

Feel free to shut down, clean up, and delete your resources, or use them in
further Getting Started exercises.

## Next steps

- While this guide shows you how to create a local user in order to access a
  server, you can also enable Teleport users to authenticate through a single
  sign-on provider. Read the
  [documentation](../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/sso.mdx) to learn more.
- Learn more about Teleport `tsh` through the [reference documentation](../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-ssh).
- For a complete list of ports used by Teleport, read the [Networking Guide](../../reference/networking.mdx).
