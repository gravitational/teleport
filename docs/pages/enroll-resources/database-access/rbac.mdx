These guides cover configuring access control policies for database users.

Read the [RBAC](./rbac/configuring-access.mdx) guide to get a general understanding
of how to configure Teleport roles to grant or deny access to your database users.

The [Automatic User Provisioning](./auto-user-provisioning.mdx) guides explain
how to get Teleport to create database user accounts on demand for MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and more.
