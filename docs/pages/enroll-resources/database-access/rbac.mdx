description: Role-based access control (RBAC) for Teleport database access.
---

**Database Access Controls** is a Teleport feature that lets you configure
role-based access controls for databases and the data within them. With Database
Access Controls, you can ensure that users only have permissions to manage the
data they need.

Access Controls encompasses two levels of granularity:

- **Database servers:** database resources enrolled with your Teleport cluster.
- **Database objects:** tables, views, or stored procedures. 

For both database servers and database objects, Database Access Controls grants
or denies access based on Teleport labels. When you enroll a database with
Teleport, you can configure the labels associated with the database. For database
objects, you can define import rules that instruct the Teleport Database Service
to apply labels to database objects imported from databases that match labels
configured within the import rule.

When a user connects to a database, the Database Service selectively grants
permissions by checking labels against the user's Teleport roles.

The Database Service grants object-level permissions for the duration of a
connection and revokes them automatically when the connection ends.

For a more general description of Teleport roles and examples see
[RBAC](../../admin-guides/access-controls/access-controls.mdx), as this section focuses on
configuring RBAC for database access.

<Notice type="warning">

Database Access Controls for database objects only supports PostgreSQL
databases.

## Role configuration

Teleport's role resource provides the following instruments for restricting
database access:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    # Label selectors for database instances this role has access to.
    #
    # These will be matched against the static/dynamic labels set on the
    # database service.
    db_labels:
      environment: ["dev", "stage"]

    # Database account names this role can connect as.
    db_users: ["viewer", "editor"]

    # Database names this role will be able to connect to.
    #
    # Note, this is not the same as the "name" field in "db_service", this is
    # the database names within a particular database instance.
    #
    # Also note, this setting has effect only for PostgreSQL. It does not
    # currently have any effect on MySQL databases/schemas.
    db_names: ["main", "metrics", "postgres"]
```

It is possible to use wildcards to match any database names/users.

For example, the following role permits access to any database/user within a
production database except for the internal "postgres" database/user:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: developer
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      environment: ["prod"]
    db_users: ["*"]
    db_names: ["*"]
  deny:
    db_users: ["postgres"]
    db_names: ["postgres"]
```

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="Deny Rules"
>
  Deny rules will match greedily. In the example above, a database connection
  attempting to use "postgres" database account (regardless of database instance
  or database name) or "postgres" database name (regardless of database instance
  or database account) will be rejected.
</Admonition>

### Database names

There's a distinction in how different database servers handle logical databases
which leads to a difference in how `db_names` role field is applied to a connection
attempt.

PostgreSQL supports multiple logical databases, and each logical database can
contain multiple schemas. In order to change to a different database, a user
disconnects from the current one and establishes a new connection. During a
PostgreSQL connection attempt, `db_names` field is checked against the name
of the logical database that the user is connecting to.

In MySQL a logical "database" and a "schema" are synonyms for each other, and
the scope of permissions a user has once connected is determined by the permission
grants set on the account within the database. As such, `db_names` role field
is not currently enforced on MySQL connection attempts.

### Template variables

Similar to other role fields, `db_*` fields support templating variables.

The `external.xyz` traits are replaced with values from external [single
sign-on](../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso.mdx) providers. For OIDC, they will be
replaced with the value of an "xyz" claim. For SAML, they are replaced 
with an "xyz" assertion value. 

For full details on how traits work in Teleport roles, see
the [Teleport Access Controls
Reference](../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).

For example, here is what a role may look like if you want to assign allowed
database names from the user's Okta `databases` assertion:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    db_names: ["{{external.databases}}"]
```

The `{{internal.db_users}}` and `{{internal.db_names}}` variables permit sharing
allowed database accounts and names with remote clusters. They will be replaced
with the respective properties of a remote user connecting from a root cluster.

For example, suppose a user in the root cluster has the following role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    db_users: ["postgres"]
    db_names: ["postgres"]
```

The role on the leaf cluster can be set up to use the user's allowed database
accounts and names:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    db_users: ["{{internal.db_users}}"]
    db_names: ["{{internal.db_names}}"]
```

## Database object import rules

A database object import rule in Teleport is a resource that defines the labels
to be applied to database objects imported into Teleport. If a specific object
does not match any of the rules, it will not be imported.

### Default import rule

By default, if no import rules are present (e.g. you create a fresh cluster or
delete all your rules), Teleport will automatically create the
`import_all_objects` rule on startup:

```yaml
kind: db_object_import_rule
metadata:
  name: import_all_objects
spec:
  # Priority determines how important the rule is, with lower number indicating lower priority.
  # In case of conflicts, when the same label is applied by two rules,
  # the label applied by rule with higher priority wins.
  priority: 0
  # database_labels is a filter specifying which database resources are in scope of this rule.
  database_labels:
  - name: '*'
    values:
    - '*'
  # Each mapping, if matched, introduces a set of labels applied to database object.
  # Database objects without labels are not imported.
  mappings:
  - add_labels:
      database: '{{obj.database}}'
      object_kind: '{{obj.object_kind}}'
      name: '{{obj.name}}'
      protocol: '{{obj.protocol}}'
      schema: '{{obj.schema}}'
      database_service_name: '{{obj.database_service_name}}'
    # match adds objects to be imported; it cannot be empty.
    match:
      # list of all table names
      table_names:
      - '*'
  # Additional mappings can be added here.
  # - add_labels: ...
version: v1
```

This rule will import all objects and label them by their inherent properties using the template syntax.

### Customizing the default import rule

You can modify the default `db_object_import_rule` as you would any other
Teleport resource.

For instance, consider the following rule designed to designate particular
tables as accessible to developers, either in a read-only or read-write
capacity:

```yaml
kind: db_object_import_rule
metadata:
  name: ownership_nonprod
spec:
  priority: 100
  database_labels:
  # Affect `dev` and `staging` environments.
  # Prod environment may have a different rule.
  - name: 'env'
    values:
    - 'staging'
    - 'dev'
    - 'prod'
  mappings:
  # Apply project label
  - add_labels:
      project: horizon
    # match section is mandatory and must contain at least one non-empty subsection
    match:
      table_names:
      - '*'
    # scope is the optional section which enables further filtering of objects by database and schema names. When omitted, this filtering is disabled.
    scope:
      database_names:
      - 'horizon'
      - 'horizon_v2'
      schema_names:
      - 'application'
      - 'data_import'
  # Add `dept: hr` label for respective tables.
  - add_labels:
      dept: hr
    match:
      table_names:
      - '*'
    scope:
      schema_names:
      - 'recruitment'
      - 'salaries'
      - 'pto'
      - 'hr_scratchpad'
version: v1
```

### Database admin user

A database admin user is responsible for granting permissions to end users. You
must specify a database admin user before using database object import rules. To
specify a database admin user, add the following to a dynamic database resource
or configuration file for an agent running the Teleport Database Service:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Dynamic Resource">

```yaml
kind: db
version: v3
metadata:
  # ...
spec:
  # ...
  admin_user: "teleport-admin"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Static Agent Configuration" >

```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  databases:
  - name: "example"
    # ...
    admin_user:
      name: "teleport-admin"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this case, the Teleport Database Service expects to activate a user called
`teleport-admin` in order to execute object import rules.  Ensure that the admin
user possesses the necessary permissions to manage users in your database,
otherwise object import rules might fail, depending on how you have configured
the database:

```code
$ tsh db connect postgres-db --db-name postgres --db-user teleport-user
psql: error: connection to server at "localhost" (::1), port 50800 failed: Connection refused
	Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
connection to server at "localhost" (127.0.0.1), port 50800 failed: your Teleport role requires automatic database user provisioning but an attempt to activate database user "teleport-user" failed due to the following error: ERROR: permission denied for table pg_subscription (SQLSTATE 42501)
ERROR: exit status 2
```

### Executing database object permission rules

The Teleport Database Service checks the roles associated with a user before
allowing that user to connect to a database.

To grant database object permissions during a database connection, the user must
be associated with a role that meets specific criteria:
- `spec.allow.db_labels` must match the database labels of particular database.
- Database user auto-provisioning must be enabled
  (`spec.options.create_db_user_mode` not set to `off` or
  `spec.options.create_db_user: true`).
- The label key/value pairs in `spec.allow.db_permissions.match` must correspond
  to the labels on the specific database object.

A user can maintain multiple simultaneous connections to the same database. All
connections must possess identical permissions; otherwise, a new connection will
be rejected. Upon the termination of the last active connection, all user
permissions are automatically revoked.

The labels on the table must be matched with an appropriate role. Here's an
example of a role that utilizes the `dept` label, applied by the
`ownership_nonprod` rule, granting read-only access to HR records in the
database. The `hr_scratchpad` table is further made editable. On the other hand,
any objects labeled `dept: sales` are made unavailable by removing all
permissions a user may have received for them. The wildcard permissions are only
allowed in the `deny` part of the spec (`spec.deny.db_permissions`):

```yaml
version: v7
kind: role
metadata:
  name: dept_hr_permissions
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    db_names:
    - '*'
    db_permissions:
    # default permission: read-only
    - match:
        object_kind: table
        dept: hr
      permissions:
      - SELECT
    # extra permissions for select tables
    - match:
        object_kind: table
        dept: hr
        name: hr_scratchpad
      permissions:
      - SELECT
      - UPDATE
      - DELETE
      - INSERT
  deny:
    db_permissions:
    # explicitly disallow any interaction with `dept: sales` tables.
    - match:
        dept: sales
      permissions:
      - '*'
  options:
    create_db_user_mode: keep
```

### Troubleshooting object import rules

To diagnose issues with importing database objects, refer to the Teleport
Database Service logs. These indicate the number of objects fetched from the
database, the number of imported objects (the difference comprising objects not
matched by any import rule), and the number of objects for which the user has
been granted permissions:
