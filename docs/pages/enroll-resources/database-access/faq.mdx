description: Frequently asked questions about Teleport database access.

This page provides the answers to common questions about enrolling databases
with Teleport. For a list of frequently asked questions about Teleport in
general, see [Frequently Asked Questions](../../faq.mdx).

## Which database protocols does Teleport the Database Service support?

The Teleport Database Service currently supports the following protocols:

- Cassandra
- ClickHouse
- CockroachDB
- DynamoDB
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Oracle
- OpenSearch
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Snowflake

For PostgreSQL, Oracle and MySQL, the following Cloud-hosted versions are supported in addition to self-hosted deployments:

- Amazon RDS
- Amazon Aurora (except for Amazon Aurora Serverless, which doesn't support IAM authentication)
- Amazon Redshift
- Google Cloud SQL
- Azure Database
- Oracle Exadata

See the available [guides](guides/guides.mdx) for all supported configurations.

## Which PostgreSQL protocol features are not supported?

The following PostgreSQL protocol features aren't currently supported:

- Any [authentication methods](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html)
  except for client certificate authentication and IAM authentication for cloud
  databases.


## Are database sessions listed under recorded sessions?

## Can database clients use a public address different from the web public address?

<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

When configuring the Teleport Proxy Service, administrators can set the
`postgres_public_addr` and `mysql_public_addr` configuration fields to public
addresses over which respective database clients should connect. See
[Proxy Configuration](../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/configuration.mdx) for
more details.

This is useful when the Teleport Web UI is running behind an L7 load balancer
(e.g. ALB in AWS), in which case the PostgreSQL/MySQL proxy needs to be exposed
on a plain TCP load balancer (e.g. NLB in AWS).

Using [TLS routing](../../reference/architecture/tls-routing.mdx) for the Teleport Proxy Service allows for all 
database connections with the web public address.

In Teleport Enterprise (Cloud), database connections use the web public address
since [TLS routing](../../reference/architecture/tls-routing.mdx) is applied.

## Do you support X database client?

Teleport relies on client certificates for authentication, so any database
client that supports this method of authentication and uses modern TLS (1.2+)
should work.

Standard command-line clients such as `psql`, `mysql`, `mongo` or `mongosh` are
supported. There are also instructions for configuring select
[graphical clients](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).

## When will you support X database?

We plan to support more databases in the future based on customer demand.

See if the database you're interested in has already been requested among
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/labels/database-access)
or open a [new issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new/choose)
to register your interest.

## Can I provide a custom CA certificate?

Yes, you can pass custom CA certificate by using a
[configuration file](../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/configuration.mdx)
(look at `ca_cert_file`).

## Can I provide a custom DNS name for Teleport generated CA?

Yes, use `server_name` under the `tls` section in your Teleport configuration
file. Please look on our reference
[configuration file](../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/configuration.mdx)
for more details.

## Can I disable CA verification when connecting to a database?

Yes, although it is not recommended. Certificate verification prevents
person-in-the-middle attacks and makes sure that you
are connected to the database that you intended to. 

Teleport also allows you to edit your
[configuration file](../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/configuration.mdx)
to provide a custom CA certificate (`ca_cert_file`) or custom DNS name
(`server_name`), which is more secure. 

If none of the above options work for you and you still want to disable the CA
check, you can use `mode` under the `tls` option in the Teleport configuration file.

For more details please refer to the reference
[configuration file](../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/configuration.mdx).

## Can I disable read-only and custom endpoints from auto-discovered databases?

Yes, you can use the Teleport generated label `endpoint-type` on your `aws`
matcher to filter the endpoints. For example, to disable read-only and custom
endpoints for RDS auto-discovery, you can specify other endpoint types to
match:
```
  aws:
  - types: ["rds"]
    regions: ["us-west-1"]
    tags:
      "env": "dev"
      "endpoint-type":
        - "primary"
        - "instance"
```

See [labels reference](../../reference/agent-services/database-access-reference/labels.mdx) for a full list of Teleport
generated labels and values.
