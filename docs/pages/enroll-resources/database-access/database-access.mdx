Teleport can provide secure connections to your databases while improving both
access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with database access:

- Enable users to retrieve short-lived database certificates using a Single Sign-On
  flow, thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [Access Request](../../admin-guides/access-controls/access-requests/access-requests.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database activity in the Teleport audit log.

Teleport protects databases through the Teleport Database Service, which is a
Teleport Agent service. For more information on agent services, read [Teleport
Agent Architecture](../../reference/architecture/agents.mdx). You can also learn how to
deploy a [pool of Teleport Agents](../agents/introduction.mdx) to run multiple
agent services.
