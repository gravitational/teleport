## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster v14.1.3 or higher with a configured [Amazon
  Redshift](../enroll-aws-databases/postgres-redshift.mdx) database.
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

Automatic user provisioning is not compatible with Redshift Serverless.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

Teleport uses the same authentication mechanism (IAM authentication) when
connecting as an admin user as for regular user connections.

The admin user must have privileges within the database to create users and
grant them privileges. The admin user must also have privileges to monitor user
processes and role assignments:
```
CREATE USER "teleport-admin" WITH PASSWORD DISABLE;
GRANT ROLE "sys:superuser" TO "teleport-admin";
```

Users created by Teleport will be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role in the
database, which will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Step 2/3. Configure a Teleport role

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/common-teleport-role.mdx!)

Users created within the database will:

- Have the same username as the authenticated Teleport user.
- Be assigned the `teleport-auto-user` role.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

## Troubleshooting

### Use your mapped remote username error

## Next steps

- Connect using your [GUI database client](../../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).
- Learn about [role templating](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx).
- Read automatic user provisioning [RFD](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/rfd/0113-automatic-database-users.md).
