## Prerequisites

- Teleport cluster v14.3 or above.
- A self-hosted MongoDB database enrolled with your Teleport cluster. Follow
  the [Teleport documentation](../enroll-self-hosted-databases/mongodb-self-hosted.mdx) to learn how
  to enroll your database.
  <Admonition type="warning" title="MongoDB Role-Based Access Control">
  Your MongoDB database must have Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enabled by
  setting
  [`security.authorization`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-security.authorization)
  to `enabled` in the configuration file.
  </Admonition>
- Ability to connect to and create user accounts in the target database.

<Admonition type="note" title="Supported services">
Automatic user provisioning is not compatible with MongoDB Atlas.

## Step 1/3. Configure database admin

Teleport uses the same authentication mechanism (X.509) when connecting as an
admin user as for regular user connections.

The admin user must have privileges within the database to create users and
grant them privileges. The admin user must also have privileges to monitor user
connections.

First create a role on `admin` database with the following privileges:

```code
db.getSiblingDB("admin").runCommand({
    createRole: "teleport-admin-role",
    privileges: [
        { resource: { cluster: true }, actions: [ "inprog" ] },
        { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "grantRole", "revokeRole" ] },
        { resource: { db: "$external", "collection": "" }, actions: [ "createUser", "updateUser", "dropUser", "viewUser", "setAuthenticationRestriction", "changeCustomData"] },
    ],
    roles: [],
})
```

<Details title="Limit the grantRole action to specific databases">
In the above example, the `grantRole` privilege is granted to the admin user
for all databases in order for the admin user to assign roles from all
databases, including the `admin` database.

To enforce the principle of least privilege, you can limit the `grantRole` to
only the databases that own the roles to be assigned to the auto-provisioned
users:

```code
db.getSiblingDB("admin").runCommand({
    createRole: "teleport-admin-role",
    privileges: [
        { resource: { cluster: true }, actions: [ "inprog" ] },
        { resource: { db: "", collection: "" }, actions: [ "revokeRole" ] },
        { resource: { db: "$external", "collection": "" }, actions: [ "createUser", "updateUser", "dropUser", "viewUser", "setAuthenticationRestriction", "changeCustomData"] },
        { resource: { db: "<db1>", collection: "" }, actions: [ "grantRole" ] },
        { resource: { db: "<db2>", collection: "" }, actions: [ "grantRole" ] },
        ...
    ],
    roles: [],
})
```
</Details>

Now create the admin user with this role:

```code
db.getSiblingDB("$external").runCommand({
  createUser: "CN=teleport-admin",
  roles: [ { role: 'teleport-admin-role', db: 'admin' } ],
})
```

## Step 2/3. Configure a Teleport role

To specify the database roles a user should be assigned within the database,
use the `db_roles` role option:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: auto-db-users
spec:
  options:
    # create_db_user_mode enables automatic user provisioning for matching databases
    create_db_user_mode: keep
  allow:
    db_labels:
      "*": "*"
    db_names:
    - "*"
    # db_roles is a list of roles the database user will be assigned
    db_roles:
    - "readAnyDatabase@admin"
    - "readWrite@db1"
    - "myCustomRole@db2"
    - "{{internal.db_roles}}"
    - "{{external.db_roles}}"
```

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/db_users_ignored.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/auto-user-provisioning/modes.mdx!)

Users created within the database will:

- Have the same username as the authenticated Teleport user.
- Have `teleport-auto-user` set to `true` in the user's `customData`.
- Be assigned all roles from the Teleport user's role set that match the database.
  The role names must be valid and exist in the database.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the database

## Troubleshooting

### Use your mapped remote username error
