## Prerequisites

- AWS OpenSearch domain.
- [Enabled AWS OpenSearch Service fine-grained access
  control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/fgac.html#fgac-enabling)
- IAM permissions to create IAM roles.
- [opensearchsql](https://github.com/opensearch-project/sql-cli)  Command Line
  Interface (CLI) tool installed in `$PATH`.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A host, e.g., an EC2 instance, where you will run the Teleport Database Service.
  This guide assumes an EC2 instance when creating and applying IAM roles, and
  must be adjusted accordingly for custom configurations.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

<Admonition type="note" title="Example Access Control">
This guide provides an example configuration of IAM access roles as a model,
and uses an EC2 instance to serve the Teleport Database Service. The level of
access provided may not suit your needs, or may not fit your organization's
access conventions. You should adjust the AWS IAM permissions to fit your needs.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/4. Create IAM roles for OpenSearch Managed Cluster access

The setup described in this guide requires two IAM roles:
- One associated with the EC2 instance running the Teleport Database Service,
  which lets it assume additional roles granted to the user.
- One that can be assumed by the EC2 instance role and grants access to OpenSearch
  manage cluster to users.

### EC2 instance role

Visit the [IAM > Roles page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/roles) of
the AWS Console, then press "Create Role". Under **Trusted entity type** select
"AWS service". Under **Use case** select "EC2", then click **Next**.

![Create Role to Identify EC2 Instance](../../../../img/database-access/guides/aws-opensearch/create-ec2-role.png)

On the "Add Permissions" page, you can simply click **Next** since this role
does not require any permissions. In this guide, we will use the example name
`TeleportDatabaseService` for this role. Once you have chosen a name, click
**Create Role** to complete the process.

### OpenSearch Service cluster access role

Navigate back to the Roles page and create a new role. Select the "AWS account"
option, which creates a default trust policy to allow other entities in this
account to assume this role:

![Create Role Step 1](../../../../img/database-access/guides/aws-opensearch/create-role-1.png)

Click **Next**. On the next page, enter a role name. In this guide we'll use
the example name `ExampleTeleportOpenSearchRole` for this role.

Under "Select trusted entities", update the JSON to allow the `TeleportDatabaseService`
role to assume this role:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::(=aws.aws_access_key=):role/TeleportDatabaseService"
                ]
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Condition": {}
        }
    ]
}
```

Finally, click **Create Role**.

### Configure Cluster Fine-grained access control IAM Role mapping in Amazon OpenSearch Managed Custer

Teleport AWS OpenSearch service integration leverages the [OpenSearch Fine-grained
access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/fgac.html)
where the IAM role or user is mapped to the OpenSearch role.

In order to configure Role Mapping log into OpenSearch Domain Dashboard using
the master user and go to the `Security` settings:

![Select Get Started](../../../../img/database-access/guides/aws-opensearch/01-opensearch_get_started.png)

Create a new role with least privilege permissions, or select an existing one.
For the purpose of this example the `readall` OpenSearch role will be used.
Select the OpenSearch role and go to the `Mapped users` tab:

![Mapped User](../../../../img/database-access/guides/aws-opensearch/02-opensearch_mapped_users.png)

Add mapping between the OpenSearch role and AWS IAM `ExampleTeleportOpenSearchRole`
role created in the previous step.

![IAM Role mapping](../../../../img/database-access/guides/aws-opensearch/03-opensearch_iam_role_mapping.png)

Finally, click the **Map** button to apply the settings.

## Step 2/4. Configure the Teleport IAM role mapping

The next step is to give your Teleport users permissions to assume AWS IAM roles
when accessing AWS resources through your Teleport cluster.

You can do this by creating a Teleport role with the `db_users` field
listing the IAM role ARN created in the previous step. Create a file called
`aws-opensearch-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: aws-opensearch-access
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      'env': 'dev'
    db_users:
    - 'ExampleTeleportOpenSearchRole'
```

Create the new role:

```code
$ tctl create -f aws-opensearch-access.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="aws-opensearch-access"!)

## Step 3/4. Install the Teleport Database Service

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl-token.mdx serviceName="Database" tokenType="db" tokenFile="/tmp/token"!)

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/alternative-methods-join.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/aws-create-db-configuration.mdx type="OpenSearch" matcher="opensearch" protocol="opensearch" example="my-opensearch-instance-xxxxxx.us-west-1.es.amazonaws.com" !)

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Database Service"!)

## Step 4/4. Connect

Once the Database Service has started and joined the cluster, you can start accessing AWS OpenSearch API:

Create a proxy tunnel:

```code
$ tsh proxy db --tunnel --port=8000 --db-user=ExampleTeleportOpenSearchRole example-opensearch
Started authenticated tunnel for the OpenSearch database "example-opensearch" in cluster "teleport.example.com" on 127.0.0.1:8000.

Use one of the following commands to connect to the database or to the address above using other database GUI/CLI clients:

  * start interactive session with opensearchsql:

  $ opensearchsql http://localhost:8000

  * run request with opensearch-cli:

  $ opensearch-cli --profile teleport --config /Users/alice/.tsh/teleport.example.dev/example-opensearch/opensearch-cli/8a5ce249.yml curl get --path /

  * run request with curl:

  $ curl http://localhost:8000/
```

You can now interact with AWS OpenSearch API via local tunnel created by the `tsh proxy db` command:

```code
$ curl http://localhost:8000/movies/_search \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
   -d '{ "query": { "match_all": {} } }'

{"took":170,"timed_out":false,"_shards":{"total":5,"successful":5,"skipped":0,"failed":0},"hits":{"total":{"value":1,"relation":"eq"},"max_score":1.0,"hits":[{"_index":"movies","_id":"1","_score":1.0,"_source":{"director": "Burton, Tim", "genre": ["Comedy","Sci-Fi"], "year": 1996, "actor": ["Jack Nicholson","Pierce Brosnan","Sarah Jessica Parker"], "title": "Mars Attacks!"}}]}}
```

Interactive session can be started using the `tsh db connect` command, which invokes the `opensearchsql` binary with interactive mode under the hood:

```code
$ tsh db connect example-opensearch --db-user=ExampleTeleportOpenSearchRole
#   ____                  _____                      __
