title: Dynamic Database Registration
description: Register/unregister databases without restarting Teleport.
---

Dynamic database registration allows Teleport administrators to register new
databases (or update/unregister existing ones) without having to update the
static configuration and restart Teleport Database Service instances. 

Dynamic registration also enables administrators to deploy multiple Database
Service instances for [high availability](./ha.mdx) by configuring Database
Service replicas to watch for the same database resources.

To enable dynamic registration, include a `resources` section in your Teleport
Database Service configuration with a list of resource label selectors you'd like this
service to monitor for registering:

```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

You can use a wildcard selector to register all dynamic app resources in the cluster
on the Database Service or provide a specific set of labels for a subset:

```yaml
resources:
- labels:
    "env": "prod"
    "engine": "postgres"
- labels:
    "env": "test"
    "engine": "mysql"
  aws:
    # Optional AWS role that the Database Service will assume to access
    # this database.
    assume_role_arn: ""
    # Optional AWS external ID that the Database Service will use to assume
    # a role in an external AWS account.
    external_id: ""
```

By default, the Database Service authenticates with the database servers using
the IAM identity assigned to the host running it or the `assume_role_arn` field
defined in the dynamic resources.

You can use `aws.assume_role_arn` to overwrite the IAM identity. If the role
requires an external ID, use `aws.external_id`. The IAM identity assigned to
the host must be able to assume the specified role.

Next define a database resource:

```yaml
kind: db
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
  description: "Example database"
  labels:
    env: prod
    engine: postgres
spec:
  protocol: "postgres"
  uri: "localhost:5432"
```

The user creating the dynamic registration needs to have a role with access to the 
database labels and the `db` resource.  In this example role the user can only
create and maintain databases labeled `env: prod` and `engine: postgres`.
```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: dynamicregexample
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      engine: postgres
      env: prod
    rules:
    - resources:
      - db
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
version: v5
```

See the full database resource spec [reference](../reference/configuration.mdx#database-resource).

To create a database resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create database.yaml
```

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

After the resource has been created, it will appear among the list of available
databases (in `tsh db ls` or UI) as long as at least one Database Service
instance picks it up according to its label selectors.

To update an existing database resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create -f database.yaml
```

If the updated resource's labels no longer match a particular database, it
will unregister and stop proxying it.

To delete a database resource, run:

```code
$ tctl rm db/example
```

Aside from `tctl`, dynamic resources can also be added by:
- [AWS Discovery](./aws-discovery.mdx)
- [Terraform Provider](../../../management/dynamic-resources/terraform-provider.mdx)
- [Kubernetes Operator](../../../management/dynamic-resources/teleport-operator.mdx)
- [Teleport API](../../../api/introduction.mdx)

See [Using Dynamic Resources](../../../management/dynamic-resources.mdx) to learn
more about managing Teleport's dynamic resources in general.
