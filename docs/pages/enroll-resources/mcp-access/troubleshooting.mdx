title: Troubleshooting MCP Access
description: Describes common issues and solutions for access to MCP servers protected by Teleport.

This section describes common issues that you might encounter in managing access
to MCP servers with Teleport and how to work around or resolve them.

## No tools available from the MCP server

By default, no MCP tools are allowed by your Teleport roles.

If a user is assigned the `access` preset role, by default the available MCP
tools are controlled by the `{{internal.mcp_tools}}` source in the role
definition. This value can be populated through user traits:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: access
spec:
  allow:
    mcp:
      tools:
      - "{{internal.mcp_tools}}"
```

You can configure this user trait with `tctl`:
```code
$ tctl users update <Var name="my_user" /> --set-mcp-tools "*"
```

Alternatively you can define a custom role that explicitly specifies the allowed
MCP tools and assigns them to users. See [RBAC](./rbac.mdx) for more details.
