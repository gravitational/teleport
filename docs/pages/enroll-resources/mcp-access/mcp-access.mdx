Teleport protects MCP servers through the Teleport Application Service, which is
a Teleport Agent service. For more information on agent services, read [Teleport
Agent Architecture](../../reference/architecture/agents.mdx). You can also learn
how to deploy a [pool of Teleport Agents](../agents/agents.mdx) to run multiple
agent services.
