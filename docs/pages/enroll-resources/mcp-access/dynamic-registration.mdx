Dynamic MCP server registration allows Teleport administrators to register new
MCP servers (or update/unregister existing ones) without having to update the
static configuration files read by Teleport Application Service instances.

The MCP server resources are registered as `app` resources in the Teleport
backend. Application Service instances periodically query the Teleport Auth
Service for `app` resources, each of which includes the information that the
Application Service needs to proxy an application.

## Required permissions

## Enabling dynamic registration

(!docs/pages/includes/application-access/dynamic-app-config.mdx!)

## Creating a MCP server

The following example configures Teleport to proxy the "Everything" MCP server
by launching it through docker:
```yaml
kind: app
version: v3
metadata:
  name: everything
  description: The Everything MCP server
  labels:
    env: dev
spec:
  mcp:
    # Command to launch stdio-based MCP servers.
    command: "docker"
    # Args to execute with the command.
    args: ["run", "-i", "--rm", "mcp/everything"]
    # Name of the host user account under which the command will be
    # executed. Required for stdio-based MCP servers.
    run_as_host_user: "docker"
```

See the full resource spec [reference](../../reference/agent-services/mcp-access.mdx).

To create the resource, run:

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
$ tctl create mcp_server.yaml
```

After the resource has been created, it will appear among the list of available
MCP servers (in `tsh mcp ls` or UI) as long as at least one Application Service
instance picks it up according to its label selectors.

To update an existing application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create -f mcp_server.yaml
```

If the updated resource's labels no longer match a particular app agent, it
will unregister and stop proxying it.

To delete the resource, run:

```code
$ tctl rm app/everything
```
