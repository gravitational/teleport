In some cases, you will want to register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport
manually, rather than letting Teleport [discover the cluster
automatically](../../auto-discovery/kubernetes/kubernetes.mdx). There are a few ways to do
this:

- [Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes
  Service with IAM Joining](iam-joining.mdx) on your cluster of
  choice.
- Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes Service outside your Kubernetes cluster (e.g.,
  directly  on a virtual machine) and [give it access to a
  kubeconfig](static-kubeconfig.mdx).
- Deploy the Teleport Kubernetes Service outside of Kubernetes  and [use dynamic
  configuration resources](dynamic-registration.mdx) to
  register your clusters.
