title: Dynamic Kubernetes Cluster Registration
description: Register and unregister Kubernetes clusters without restarting a Teleport Kubernetes Service instance.
---

With dynamic Kubernetes cluster registration, you can manage the Kubernetes
clusters connected to your Teleport cluster without needing to modify the
configuration file of an individual Kubernetes Service instance. 

Dynamic Kubernetes cluster registration is useful when you have deployed
multiple Kubernetes Service instances or need to regularly reconfigure access to
Kubernetes clusters in your infrastructure.

In this guide, we will show you how to set up dynamic Kubernetes cluster
registration, then create, list, update, and delete Kubernetes clusters via
`tctl`.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Linux host where you will install the Teleport Kubernetes Service.

  <Notice type="tip">

  Our `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart does not support dynamic Kubernetes
  cluster registration.

  </Notice>

- A Kubernetes cluster to join to your Teleport cluster. You must have
  permissions to create namespaces, secrets, service accounts, cluster roles,
  and cluster role bindings in the cluster.

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Set up the Teleport Kubernetes Service

The Teleport Kubernetes Service proxies traffic from Teleport users to a
Kubernetes API server so you can take advantage of passwordless authentication,
role-based access controls, audit logging, and other Teleport features in order
to manage access to Kubernetes. 

In this step, you will install the Teleport Kubernetes Service on a Linux host
and configure it to access any Kubernetes cluster you register with your
Teleport cluster. 

### Get a join token

Establish trust between your Teleport cluster and your new Kubernetes Service
instance by creating a join token:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=kube --ttl=1h --format=text
(=presets.tokens.first=)
```

Copy the token and keep it somewhere safe so you can use it when running the
Teleport Kubernetes Service.

### Install the Teleport Kubernetes Service

Install the Teleport Kubernetes Service on your Linux host:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Configure the Teleport Kubernetes Service

On the host where you will run the Teleport Kubernetes Service, run the
following command to create a base configuration for your Teleport instance,
assigning `PROXY_SERVICE` to the host and port of your Teleport Proxy Service or
Teleport Cloud tenant and `TOKEN` to the join token we created earlier:

```code
# e.g., teleport.example.com:443
$ PROXY_SERVICE=<Var name="proxy-addr"/>
# e.g., (=presets.tokens.first=);
$ TOKEN=<Var name="join-token"/>;
$ sudo teleport configure \
--proxy=${PROXY_SERVICE?} \
--roles=kube \
--token=${TOKEN?} \
-o file
```

Edit your configuration file at `/etc/teleport.yaml` to include the following:

```yaml
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

This configuration enables your Kubernetes Service instance to connect to any
Kubernetes clusters you register with your Teleport cluster. This is because the
`resources[0].labels` field includes the wildcard pattern (`"*": "*"`), which
allows this Kubernetes Service instance to connect to Kubernetes cluster
resources with any label key or value.

<Details title="Selectively watching Kubernetes clusters">

You can configure a Kubernetes Service instance to watch for a subset of
Kubernetes clusters by including specific label keys and values instead of
wildcard characters:

```yaml
resources:
- labels:
    "env": "prod"
    "region": "us-east-2"
- labels:
    "env": "test"
    "region": "us-west-1"
```

For the Kubernetes Service to register a cluster, *any* of the items in
`resources` must match the cluster's labels. For an item in `resources` to
match, *all* of the `labels` entries within that item must match the cluster's
labels.

For example, a cluster with the labels `env:prod` and `region:us-west-1` would
not match the configuration above, since it only matches the `env:prod` label in
the first `resources` item and the `region:us-west-1` label in the second
`resources` item.

However, a cluster with `env:test` and `region:us-west-1` would match, since it
matches both labels given in the second `resources` item.

When you create dynamic Kubernetes cluster resources later in this guide, you
can assign them labels to ensure that only specific Kubernetes Service instances
will watch for them.

</Details>

### Run the Teleport Kubernetes Service

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport Kubernetes Service"!)

## Step 2/3. Authorize your user 

To enable dynamic Kubernetes cluster registration in Teleport, you will need to
authorize your user to access the Kubernetes clusters you want to register with
Teleport. We will configure this access in this step, both in Teleport and on
your Kubernetes cluster.

### Allow access to your Kubernetes cluster

Ensure that you are in the correct Kubernetes context for the cluster you would
like to enable access to.

Retrieve all available contexts:

```code
$ kubectl config get-contexts
```

Switch to your context, replacing `CONTEXT_NAME` with the name of your chosen
context:

```code
$ kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME
Switched to context CONTEXT_NAME
```

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/rbac.mdx!)

### Authorize your user to manage Kubernetes clusters

Teleport tracks Kubernetes clusters in your infrastructure via dynamic
`kube_cluster` resources. To manage access to Kubernetes clusters with Teleport,
your user will need permissions to manage these resources. 

In the previous section, you authorized your user to access all Kubernetes
clusters registered in your Teleport cluster. Now that you can access these
clusters, create a role that enables you to manage them.

Create a role definition called `kube-manager.yaml` with the following content: 

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: kube-manager
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      - kube_cluster
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
version: v5
```

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f kube-manager.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="kube-manager"!)

## Step 3/3. Manage dynamic Kubernetes cluster resources

Now that your Teleport user has permissions to manage Kubernetes cluster
resources, we will show you how to create, list, update, and delete them. 

### Create a kubeconfig

In this section, you will create a Kubernetes `Config` resource, or kubeconfig,
that your Teleport cluster will use to authenticate to your Kubernetes cluster.

When you signed into Teleport earlier in this guide, `tsh` may have changed your
Kubernetes context to one based on your Teleport cluster, so make sure you
update your Kubernetes context to match the cluster you would like to connect to
Teleport: 

```code
$ kubectl config get-contexts
# Assign CONTEXT_NAME to your chosen context
$ kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME
```

On your workstation, download Teleport's `get-kubeconfig.sh` script, which you
will use to generate the kubeconfig:

```code
$ curl -OL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/v(=teleport.version=)/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh
```

The script creates a service account for the Teleport Kubernetes Service that
can get Kubernetes pods as well as impersonate users, groups, and other service
accounts. The Teleport Kubernetes Service uses this service account to manage
access to resources in your Kubernetes cluster. The script also ensures that
there is a Kubernetes `Secret` in your cluster to store service account
credentials. 

`get-kubeconfig.sh` creates a namespace called `teleport` for the resources it
deploys, though you can choose a different name by assigning the
`TELEPORT_NAMESPACE` environment variable in the shell where you run the script. 

After creating resources, `get-kubeconfig.sh` writes a new kubeconfig to a file
called `kubeconfig` in the directory where you run the script.

Run the `get-kubeconfig.sh` script:

```code
$ bash get-kubeconfig.sh
```

The script is successful if you see this message:

```text
Done!
```

Ignore the script's instructions to copy the generated kubeconfig file to the
Teleport Proxy Service. In the next section, we will show you how to use the
kubeconfig file when creating a dynamic `kube_cluster` resource.

### Create a Kubernetes cluster resource

Define a `kube_cluster` resource with the following content in a file called
`kube_cluster.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: kube_cluster
version: v3
metadata:
  name: mycluster
spec:
  kubeconfig: |
```

The `spec.kubeconfig` field in the snippet above begins a multi-line string.
Below, you will include the contents of the kubeconfig file as its value.

Since `spec.kubeconfig` must be a base64-encoded string, convert the kubeconfig
file to base64, then indent it and add it to the `kube_cluster.yaml` resource
definition using the following command:

```code
$ printf "    %s" $(cat kubeconfig | base64) >> kube_cluster.yaml
```

<Details title="Add labels to your kube_cluster">

You can add labels to the `kube_cluster` resource, allowing you to manage access
to specific clusters from your Teleport roles or Kubernetes Service instances.

Labels can either be static or dynamic. Static labels are key/value pairs. This
example defines the `env=prod` and `team=dev` labels:

```yaml
kind: kube_cluster
version: v3
metadata:
  name: mycluster
  labels:
    env: prod
    team: dev
spec:
  kubeconfig: KUBECONFIG
```

You can also add dynamic labels, which define shell commands that a Kubernetes
Service instance will execute in order to generate labels. To do so, edit the
`spec.dynamic_labels` field of a `kube_cluster` resource. 

This example runs the `python3 get_region.py` command to fetch the region in
which the Kubernetes Service is deployed and assign the result to the `region`
key:

```yaml
kind: kube_cluster
version: v3
metadata:
  name: mycluster
spec:
  kubeconfig: KUBECONFIG
  dynamic_labels:
    region:
      period: "24h"
      command: ["python3", "get_region.py"]
```

When defining a dynamic label, the key within the `spec.dynamic_labels` field
behaves the same as keys within the `metadata.labels` field, indicating the key
of the label. 

The Kubernetes Service obtains a value for that key by running the
command given in `command` every `period`. `command` is an array of strings,
where the first element indicates the command to execute and each subsequent
element indicates an argument. 

`period` is a Go duration string, which includes a number and a unit of time.
Supported units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, and `h`. The example
above configures the Kubernetes Service to run the command every day.

</Details>

To create the `kube_cluster` resource, run the following command:

```code
$ tctl create kube_cluster.yaml
kubernetes cluster "mycluster" has been created
```

### Access your new Kubernetes cluster

Instances of the Teleport Kubernetes Service watch for newly created or updated
`kube_cluster` resources. When you create the `kube_cluster` resource, any
Kubernetes Service instances you have configured to track that cluster's labels
will register that cluster and enable access to it via Teleport.

As a result, you should now see the cluster you registered above when you run
`tsh kube ls`: 

```code
$ tsh kube ls
 Kube Cluster Name Labels                      Selected
 ----------------- --------------------------- --------
 mycluster         teleport.dev/origin=dynamic
```

The `teleport.dev/origin=dynamic` label indicates that the cluster was
registered dynamically.

You can also log in to the cluster you just registered:

```code
$ tsh kube login mycluster
Logged into kubernetes cluster "mycluster". Try 'kubectl version' to test the
connection.
```

### List Kubernetes cluster resources

You can list `kube_cluster` resources with the following command:

```code
$ tctl get kube_clusters
```

### Update a Kubernetes cluster resource

To update the `kube_cluster` resource you created earlier, execute the following
command to retrieve the resource as it exists on the Auth Service's backend:

```code
$ tctl get kube_clusters/mycluster > kube_cluster.yaml
```

Edit the `kube_cluster.yaml` file to add a label to your `kube_cluster`:

```diff
  kind: kube_cluster
  metadata:
    id: 9999999999999999999
    labels:
      teleport.dev/origin: dynamic
+     env: test
    name: mycluster
  spec:
    aws: {}
    azure: {}
    kubeconfig: KUBECONFIG
  version: v3
```

Update the resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f kube_cluster.yaml
kubernetes cluster "mycluster" has been updated
```

You should now see the updated labels:

```code
$ tsh kube ls
 Kube Cluster Name Labels                               Selected
 ----------------- ------------------------------------ --------
 mycluster         env=test teleport.dev/origin=dynamic *
```

<Notice type="warning">

If the updated `kube_cluster` resource's labels no longer match the ones a Teleport
Kubernetes Service instance is configured to watch, the instance will unregister
and stop proxying the Kubernetes cluster.  

</Notice>

### Delete Kubernetes cluster resources

To delete the `kube_cluster` resource you created earlier, run the following
command:

```code
$ tctl rm kube_clusters/mycluster
kubernetes cluster "mycluster" has been deleted
```

This will unregister the Kubernetes cluster from Teleport:

```code
$ tsh kube ls
Kube Cluster Name Labels Selected
----------------- ------ --------
```
