title: Register a Kubernetes Cluster with a Static kubeconfig
description: Connecting standalone Teleport installations to Kubernetes clusters.
---

While you can register a Kubernetes cluster with Teleport by running the
Teleport Kubernetes Service [on that cluster](../getting-started.mdx), you can
also run the Teleport Kubernetes Service on a Linux host outside the cluster.
This is useful if you want to decouple your Teleport deployment from the
Kubernetes clusters you want to manage access to.

In this setup, the Teleport Kubernetes Service uses a `kubeconfig` file to
authenticate to the API server of your chosen Kubernetes cluster.

(!docs/pages/includes/permission-warning.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Kubernetes cluster you would like to access.
- A Linux host deployed on your own infrastructure to run the Teleport
  Kubernetes Service. This can run outside of your Kubernetes cluster. 
- The [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) command line
  tool installed on your workstation.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Generate a kubeconfig file

The Teleport Kubernetes Service uses a `kubeconfig` file to authenticate to your
Kubernetes cluster. In this section, we will generate a `kubeconfig` file so we
can configure the Teleport Kubernetes Service to use it later in this guide.

### Ensure your context is correct

First, configure your local `kubectl` command to point at the Kubernetes cluster
you want to register. You can use the following command to verify that
the correct cluster is selected:

```code
$ kubectl config get-contexts
```

Use this command to switch to the cluster assigned to 
<Var name="context-name"/>:

```code
# e.g., my-context
$ kubectl config use-context <Var name="context-name" />}
```

### Run the script

On your workstation, download Teleport's `get-kubeconfig.sh` script, which you
will use to generate the `kubeconfig` file:

```code
$ curl -OL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/teleport/v(=teleport.version=)/examples/k8s-auth/get-kubeconfig.sh
```

`get-kubeconfig.sh` creates a service account for the Teleport Kubernetes
Service that can get Kubernetes pods as well as impersonate users, groups, and
other service accounts. The Teleport Kubernetes Service uses this service
account to manage access to resources in your Kubernetes cluster. The script
also ensures that there is a Kubernetes `Secret` in your cluster to store
service account credentials. 

`get-kubeconfig.sh` also creates a namespace called `teleport` for the
resources it deploys, though you can choose a different name by assigning the
`TELEPORT_NAMESPACE` environment variable in the shell where you run the
script. 

After creating resources, `get-kubeconfig.sh` writes a new `kubeconfig` file
called `kubeconfig` in the directory where you run the script.

Run the `get-kubeconfig.sh` script:

```code
$ bash get-kubeconfig.sh
```

The script is successful if you see this message:

```text
Done!
```

Move the `kubeconfig` file to the host you are using to run the Teleport
Kubernetes Service. We will assume that the `kubeconfig` file exists at
`/var/lib/teleport/kubeconfig`.

<details>
<summary>Connecting multiple Kubernetes clusters?</summary>

You can connect multiple Kubernetes clusters to Teleport from one `kubeconfig`
file if it contains multiple entries. Use
[merge-kubeconfigs.sh](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/examples/k8s-auth/merge-kubeconfigs.sh)
to combine multiple `kubeconfig` files generated by `get-kubeconfig.sh`.

</details>

## Step 2/4. Set up the Teleport Kubernetes Service

In this step, you will install the Teleport Kubernetes Service and configure it
to use the `kubeconfig` file you generated to access a Kubernetes cluster.

### Get a join token

Establish trust between your Teleport cluster and your new Kubernetes Service
instance by creating a join token:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=kube --format=text --ttl=1h
(=presets.tokens.first=)
```

Assign <Var name="join-token" /> to your join token. On the host where you are
running the Teleport Kubernetes Service, create a file called `/tmp/token` that
consists only of your token:

```code
$ echo <Var name="join-token" /> | sudo tee /tmp/token
```

### Install the Teleport Kubernetes Service

Run the following commands on the host where you will install the Teleport
Kubernetes Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Configure the Teleport Kubernetes Service

Assign <Var name="teleport.example.com:443" /> with the host and port of your
Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Cloud tenant, e.g.,
`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`. On the host where you will run the Teleport
Kubernetes Service, create a file at `/etc/teleport.yaml` with the following
content:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: <Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  kubeconfig_file: "/var/lib/teleport/kubeconfig"
  labels:
    "region": "us-east1"
```


<Admonition type="warning" title="Warning" >

When using `kubeconfig_file`, Amazon EKS users may need to replace illegal
characters in the `context` names. Supported characters are alphanumeric
characters, `.`, `_`, and `-`. EKS typically includes `:` and `@` in their
`kubeconfig` files, which are not allowed in Teleport.

</Admonition>

### Start the Teleport Kubernetes Service

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport Kubernetes Service"!)

## Step 3/4. Grant access to your Teleport user

Enable your Teleport user to access resources in your Kubernetes cluster so you
can connect to the cluster later in this guide.

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/rbac.mdx!)

## Step 4/4. Access your Kubernetes cluster

After Teleport starts with the above config, you should be able to see all new
clusters:

```code
$ tsh kube ls
Kube Cluster Name                       Labels           Selected
--------------------------------------- ------           --------
my-cluster                              region=us-east-1
```

To access your cluster, run the following command, replacing `my-cluster` with
the name of the cluster you would like to access:

```code
$ tsh kube login my-cluster
Logged into kubernetes cluster "my-cluster". Try 'kubectl version' to test the connection.
```
