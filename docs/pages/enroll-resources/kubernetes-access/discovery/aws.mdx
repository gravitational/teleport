title: Teleport EKS Auto-Discovery
description: How to configure auto-discovery of AWS EKS clusters in Teleport.
---

EKS Auto-Discovery can automatically
discover any EKS cluster and enroll it in Teleport if its tags match the
configured labels.

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-discovery/step-description.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An AWS account with permissions to create and attach IAM policies.
- An AWS account with `system:masters` RBAC access to EKS clusters.
- A host to run the Teleport Discovery and Kubernetes services.
- One or more EKS clusters running.

## Known limitations

Due to the authorization method that AWS has chosen for EKS clusters, it is not
possible for the Teleport process to configure the necessary permissions to forward
requests to EKS clusters.
This limitation exists because the authorization method on EKS clusters requires that the IAM role -
used for authentication - exists in the
[`aws-auth`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html) `ConfigMap`.

In this `ConfigMap`, IAM roles are mapped to Kubernetes RBAC users or groups that are then
used by Kubernetes RBAC to grant access permissions. If the mapping does not exist, it results in
unauthorized requests. Therefore, Teleport cannot edit the `ConfigMap`
without first having access to the cluster.

If Teleport is not running with the same IAM identity that creates all clusters,
please ensure you configure the required permissions as described in Step 2.

<Admonition type="note">

The AWS EKS team is working on a feature request to introduce an external API to manage access to the cluster without manually editing the Configmap ([aws/containers-roadmap#185](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/185)).

Hopefully, once the feature is available, Teleport can leverage it to configure its access to the cluster.

</Admonition>

## Step 1/3. Set up AWS IAM credentials

For Teleport to discover EKS clusters, the instance
running the Discovery Service requires an IAM policy that allows Teleport to list and
describe EKS clusters:

```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "eks:DescribeCluster",
                "eks:ListClusters"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 2/3. Configure EKS cluster authorization

When the Kubernetes Service uses an IAM role that is different from the one that
creates the clusters, you need to configure the mapping between the Teleport IAM
Role and the Kubernetes RBAC permissions by editing the `aws-auth` `Configmap` on
each of the discovered clusters.

To forward requests to the Kubernetes cluster, the Teleport Kubernetes Service
requires cluster-wide permissions to `Impersonate` RBAC users and groups, to
create `SelfSubjectAccessReviews` and `SelfSubjectRulesReviews`, and, finally,
read access to `Pods`.

If your Kubernetes cluster does not have an RBAC group with the required
permissions, you can create the `ClusterRole`, `ClusterRoleBinding`, and the
mapping by following the Creating RBAC group guide.
If your cluster already has an RBAC group that satisfies the required permissions,
you can reuse it and map it into the IAM Role used by the Teleport Kubernetes
Service. For simplicity, it is also possible to map the Teleport IAM role onto
a built-in Kubernetes RBAC group like `system:masters`, but not recommended in
production.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Creating RBAC group" >

Connect to your target cluster with your credentials and create the following
resources using `kubectl`.

### ClusterRole

Create the `ClusterRole` RBAC definition with the required permissions for Teleport
Kubernetes Service to forward requests to the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: teleport
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - users
  - groups
  - serviceaccounts
  verbs:
  - impersonate
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - pods
  verbs:
  - get
- apiGroups:
  - "authorization.k8s.io"
  resources:
  - selfsubjectaccessreviews
  - selfsubjectrulesreviews
  verbs:
  - create
```

### ClusterRoleBinding

Link the previously created `ClusterRole` into a `teleport` RBAC group.

```yaml
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: teleport
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: teleport
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: teleport
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### IAM mapping

Finally, edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append
the following to `mapRoles`. Replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the
appropriate IAM role that Teleport Kubernetes Service will use.
This step will link the Teleport IAM role into the Kubernetes RBAC group `teleport`,
allowing Teleport Kubernetes Service to forward requests into the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  mapRoles: |
    - groups:
      - teleport
      rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
      username: teleport
```

At this point, the Teleport IAM role already has the minimum permissions
to forward requests to the cluster.

  </TabItem>
<TabItem label="Reuse an existing RBAC Group" >

To associate the Teleport IAM role with an existing Kubernetes RBAC group,
edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append
the following to `mapRoles`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  mapRoles: |
  ...
    - groups:
      - {rbac_group}
      rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
      username: teleport
```

Please replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the appropriate IAM role that
Teleport Kubernetes Service is using and `{rbac_group}` with the existing Kubernetes
RBAC Group that satisfies the required permissions.

At this point, the Teleport IAM role already has the minimum permissions
to forward requests to the cluster.

  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="Use system:masters" >

    <Notice type="warning">
Granting the `system:masters` group to the IAM role associated with the Teleport
service means granting administrator-level permissions on the Kubernetes cluster.
To follow least privilege principle we do not recommend using this method in production.
  </Notice>

To associate the Teleport IAM role with the `system:masters` RBAC group,
edit the `configmap/aws-auth` in the `kube-system` namespace and append
the following to `mapRoles`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  mapRoles: |
  ...
    - groups:
      - system:masters
      rolearn: {teleport_aws_iam_role} # e.g. arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/teleport-role
      username: teleport
```

Please replace `{teleport_aws_iam_role}` with the appropriate IAM role that
Teleport Kubernetes Service is using.

At this point, the Teleport IAM role already has the minimum permissions
to forward requests to the cluster.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Notice type="tip">
If you provision your EKS clusters using tools such as `terraform`, `eksctl` or
`Cloudformation`, you can use them to automatically configure the `aws-auth` `Configmap`
and create the `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` resources during cluster provisioning.
</Notice>

## Step 3/3. Configure Teleport to discover EKS clusters

### Get a join token

Teleport EKS Auto-Discovery requires a valid Teleport auth token for the Discovery and
Kubernetes services to join the cluster. Generate one by running the following
command against your Teleport Auth Service and save it in `/tmp/token` on the
machine that will run Kubernetes Discovery:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery,kube
```

### Configure the Teleport Kubernetes and Discovery Services

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-discovery/discovery-group.mdx!)

Enabling EKS Auto-Discovery requires that the `discovery_service.aws` section
include at least one entry and that `discovery_service.aws.types` include `eks`.
It also requires configuring the `kubernetes_service.resources.tags` to use the same
labels configured at `discovery_service.aws.tags` or a subset of them to make
the Kubernetes Service listen to the dynamic resources created by the Discovery
Service.

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: <Var name="teleport.example.com" />:443
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  discovery_group: "aws-prod"
  aws:
   - types: ["eks"]
     regions: ["*"]
     tags:
       "env": "prod" # Match EKS cluster tags where tag:env=prod
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "env": "prod" # Match Kubernetes Cluster labels specified earlier
```

### Start the Kubernetes and Discovery Services

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx service="the Kubernetes and Discovery Services"!)

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Kubernetes and Discovery Services"!)

Once the Kubernetes and Discovery Services start, EKS clusters matching the tags
and regions specified in the AWS section will be added to the Teleport cluster
automatically.
