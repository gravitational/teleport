Teleport Kubernetes Auto-Discovery involves two components.

The first, the Discovery Service, is responsible for watching your cloud
provider and checking if there are any new clusters or if there have been any
modifications to previously discovered clusters. The second, the Kubernetes
Service, monitors the clusters created by the Discovery Service. It proxies
communications between users and the API servers of these clusters.

<Admonition type="tip">

This guide presents the Discovery Service and Kubernetes Service running in the
same process, however both can run independently and on different machines. 

For example, you can run an instance of the Kubernetes Service in each
Kubernetes cluster you want to register with Teleport, and an instance of the
Discovery Service in any network you wish.
