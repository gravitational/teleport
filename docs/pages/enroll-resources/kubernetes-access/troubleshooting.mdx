## An agent failed to join a cluster due to "no authorities for hostname"

### Symptoms

The agent can't rejoin the Teleport cluster after restart and reports an error
similar to:

```text
ssh: handshake failed: ssh: no authorities for hostname
```

### Explanation

Teleport uses certificate authorities (CAs) to sign certificates for each
component. When the component joins the cluster for the first time, it
receives a certificate signed by the cluster's CA and stores it in its
state directory. When the component restarts, it uses the certificate stored in
its state directory to join the cluster again.

This error occurs when the component tries to rejoin the Teleport cluster, but the
cluster's CA has changed and the component's certificate is no longer valid.

It can happen when the cluster's CA is rotated or when the cluster is recreated
or renamed.

### Resolution

The agent's state needs to be reset, so it can request a new certificate and join
the cluster again.

The process for deleting the agent's state depends on whether the agent is
running inside or outside of Kubernetes.

#### Agents running outside of Kubernetes (standalone)

If the agent is running outside of Kubernetes, the state directory is located
at `/var/lib/teleport/proc` by default. You can delete the state directory with
the following command:

```code
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/teleport/proc
```

And then restart the agent:

```code
sudo systemctl restart teleport
```

#### Agents running in Kubernetes (`teleport-kube-agent`)

Starting in Teleport 11, the `teleport-kube-agent` pod's state is stored in a
Kubernetes Secret - name:`{pod-name}-state` - existing in the installation namespace.
To delete the state, follow the steps below:

```code
# Get the secrets for the teleport-kube-agent pods
$ kubectl get secret -o name -n teleport-agent | grep "state"
teleport-agent-0-state
teleport-agent-1-state

# Delete the secrets
$ kubectl delete secret -n teleport-agent teleport-agent-0-state teleport-agent-1-state
```

If you're mounting `/var/lib/teleport` into the container, please clean the
contents of `/var/lib/teleport/proc` inside the container and then restart
the container.

Once the state is deleted, restart each agent pod.

## Unable to connect to GKE Autopilot clusters

```text
GKE Warden authz [denied by user-impersonation-limitation]: impersonating system identities are not allowed
```

### Symptoms

After configuring a GKE Autopilot cluster in Teleport, all attempts to retrieve
Kubernetes Objects fail with an error similar to:

Or the following:

```text
GKE Autopilot denies requests that impersonate "system:masters" group
```

<Admonition type="note">
This issue only affects GKE Autopilot clusters. If you're using a standard GKE
cluster, this issue doesn't apply to you.
</Admonition>

### Explanation

Unlike the standard Kubernetes cluster, Autopilot clusters forbid requests to
impersonate system identities. This is a security feature that prevents users
from gaining access to the cluster's control plane and performing administrative
actions if they can impersonate users or groups.
[Learn more about GKE Autopilot security](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-security#built-in-security).

Teleport uses impersonation to retrieve Kubernetes objects
on behalf of the user. This is done by sending a request to the Kubernetes API server
with the user's identity in the `Impersonate-User` header and all the Kubernetes
Groups they can use in the `Impersonate-Group` header.

Since `system:masters` is a built-in Kubernetes group in all clusters, it's usual
for administrators to use it to gain administrative access to the cluster's control
plane. However, Autopilot clusters forbid impersonating this group and require that
another group is used instead.

### Resolution

Per the description above, the solution is to configure a different group for
impersonation in Teleport. This can be done by setting the role's
`kubernetes_group` parameter to a Group that the Autopilot cluster allows to
impersonate.

The `teleport-kube-agent` chart configures a Kubernetes Group with the same access
levels as the `system:masters` group when it detects the target cluster is a GKE
cluster.
This group is named, by default, `cluster-admin`, but the name can be changed
by setting the `adminClusterRoleBinding.name` parameter.

The Kubernetes Group isn't created automatically when installing the chart on
non-GKE clusters, so don't change the `kubernetes_groups` parameter to
`cluster-admin` unless you created the group manually or installed the chart with
`adminClusterRoleBinding.create` parameter set to `true`.

It's important to note that the group must be configured in the cluster before
it can be used for impersonation. If the group is not configured, the impersonation
request will fail with a `403 Forbidden` error and the user will not be able to
access the cluster.

When you opt to continue using the `system:masters` group for impersonation in
non-Autopilot clusters, you must ensure that the Teleport roles that grant
`system:masters` access can't be used to access GKE Autopilot clusters.

As an example, a user with the following role can impersonate the `system:masters`
group in any Kubernetes cluster:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: k8s-admin
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_groups: ["system:masters"]
```

The wildcard `*` in `kubernetes_labels` allows the user to access any Kubernetes
cluster in the Teleport cluster. To prevent the user from accessing GKE Autopilot
clusters with that role, you can install the `teleport-kube-agent` chart with
a label that identifies the cluster as an Autopilot cluster. For example:

```code
$ PROXY_ADDR=teleport.example.com:443
$ CLUSTER=cookie
# Create the values.yaml file
$ cat > values.yaml << EOF
authToken: "${TOKEN}"
proxyAddr: "${PROXY_ADDR}"
roles: "kube,app,discovery"
joinParams:
  method: "token"
  tokenName: "${TOKEN}"
kubeClusterName: "${CLUSTER}"
labels:
  "type" : "autopilot"
EOF
# Install the helm chart with the values.yaml setting
$ helm install teleport-agent teleport/teleport-kube-agent \
  -f values.yaml \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace=teleport-agent \
  --version (=teleport.version=)
```

Make sure that the Teleport Agent pod is running. You should see one Teleport
agent pod pod with a single ready container:

```code
$ kubectl -n teleport-agent get pods
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
teleport-agent-0   1/1     Running   0          32s
```

Now that the cluster is labeled, you can split the `k8s-admin` role into two
roles: one that allows access to all non-Autopilot clusters and another that only
allows access to Autopilot clusters.

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: k8s-admin-non-gke-autopilot
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels_expression: 'labels["type"] != "autopilot"'
    kubernetes_groups: ["system:masters"]
---
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: k8s-admin-gke-autopilot
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels_expression: 'labels["type"] == "autopilot"'
    kubernetes_groups: ["cluster-admin"]
```

Once the roles are created, you can assign them to users as usual, but
to be effective immediately, they must logout and login again.

## Unable to exec into a Pod with kubectl 1.30+

```text
pods "<pod_name>" is forbidden: User "<user>" cannot get resource "pods/exec" in API group "" in the namespace "<namespace>"
```

### Symptoms

After upgrading `kubectl` to version 1.30 or later, attempts to exec into a Pod
fail with an error similar to:

```text
pods "<pod_name>" is forbidden: User "<user>" cannot get resource "pods/exec" in API group "" in the namespace "<namespace>"
```

### Explanation

Starting with Kubernetes 1.30, the `kubectl exec` command switched from using
the SPDY protocol to the WebSocket protocol for communicating with the Kubernetes
API server. This change was made to enhance the performance and reliability of
the `kubectl exec` command, as the SPDY protocol was deprecated.

Although WebSocket was intended to be a drop-in replacement for SPDY, it introduced
a breaking change for Kubernetes clusters where RBAC was configured to restrict
access to the `pods/exec` resource using only the `create` verb. Previously,
the SPDY protocol allowed creating a connection using either
`GET` (mapped to `get` in Kubernetes RBAC) or
`POST` (mapped to `create` in Kubernetes RBAC).

With the WebSocket protocol, the `kubectl exec` command always uses the `GET`
method to create a connection. This means that if the RBAC policy permits only
the `create` verb, the connection will be denied.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, update the RBAC policy to allow the `get` verb for
the `pods/exec` (sub)resource. This can be done by modifying the `ClusterRole`
or `Role` that grants access to the user.

For example, if you have a `ClusterRole` that grants access to the `pods/exec`
resource with the `create` verb, update it to allow the `get` verb as well:

```yaml
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/exec"]
  verbs: ["create", "get"]
```

Once the `ClusterRole` is updated, you should be able to exec into Pods using
`kubectl` version 1.30 or later.
