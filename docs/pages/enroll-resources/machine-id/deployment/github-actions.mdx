title: Deploying Machine ID on GitHub Actions
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on GitHub Actions
---

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that works as a part of the larger
GitHub ecosystem. Teleport Machine ID allows GitHub Actions to securely interact
with Teleport protected resources without the need for long-lived credentials.

Teleport supports secure joining on both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted GitHub
Actions runners as well as GitHub Enterprise Server.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- Your user should have the privileges to create token resources.
- A GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled. This guide uses the example
  `gravitational/example` repo, however this value should be replaced with
  your own unique repo.

## Step 1/3. Create a Bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 2/3. Create a join token for GitHub Actions

In order to allow your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with your
Teleport cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out
criteria by which the Auth Service decides whether to allow a bot or node
to join.

In this example, you will create a join token that grants access to any
GitHub Actions run within a specific GitHub repository. In production, you may
wish to further restrict these rules to ensure that access can only occur
when CI is running against a specific branch. You can find a full list of the
available rules on the
[GitHub Actions reference page.](../../../reference/machine-id/github-actions.mdx)

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  # The Bot role indicates that this token grants access to a bot user, rather
  # than allowing a node to join. This role is built in to Teleport.
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: github
  # The bot_name indicates which bot user this token grants access to. This
  # should match the name of the bot that you created in the previous step.
  bot_name: example
  github:
    # allow specifies rules that control which GitHub Actions runs will be
    # granted access. Those not matching any allow rule will be denied.
    allow:
    # repository should include the name of the owner of the repository.
    - repository: gravitational/example
```

Replace `gravitational/example` with the name of the repository that `tbot`
will run within. You may also choose to change the name of the bot and token
to more accurately describe your use-case.

<Admonition type="note" title="Using GitHub Enterprise?">
**Enterprise Server**

If you are using self-hosted Teleport Enterprise you are able to permit
workflows within GitHub Enterprise Server instances to authenticate using the
GitHub join method.

The Teleport Auth Server must be able to connect to the GitHub Enterprise
Server.

To configure this, set `spec.github.enterprise_server_host` to the hostname of
the GHES instance.

For example:
```yaml
spec:
  github:
    enterprise_server_host: ghes.example.com
```

**Enterprise Cloud**

If you have enabled `include_enterprise_slug` in your GitHub Enterprise
Cloud configuration, you will need to set `spec.github.enterprise_slug` to
the slug of your GitHub Enterprise organization.

For example:
```yaml
spec:
  github:
    enterprise_slug: my-enterprise
```

Read more about `include_enterprise_slug` on the GitHub guide to
[customizing the issuer value for an enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#customizing-the-issuer-value-for-an-enterprise).
</Admonition>

Once the resource file has been written, create the token with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

Check that token `example-bot` has been created with the following
command:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token       Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
----------- ---- ------ ----------------------------------------------
example-bot Bot         01 Jan 00 00:00 UTC (2562047h47m16.854775807s)
```

## Step 3/3. Configure a GitHub Actions Workflow

Now that the bot has been successfully created, you now need to configure your
GitHub Action's workflow to authenticate as this bot and then use the
credentials produced by `tbot`. To help with this, Teleport publishes
several easy-to-use GitHub Actions that can be used within your workflow.

It is also possible to manually configure `tbot` rather than using one of the
Teleport GitHub Actions. This involves more configuration but allows for
precise control of `tbot` and allows for implementations that are not possible
with the actions.

What follows is examples demonstrating two of the GitHub Actions available as
well as showing how to manually configure `tbot` for use with GitHub Actions.

### Example: `teleport-actions/auth`

The `teleport-actions/auth` action generates a versatile identity output that
can be used for SSH and for administrative actions against a Teleport cluster.
Environment variables are configured by this action and these automatically
configure `tsh` and `tctl` to use this identity.

This example shows using the credentials to:

- List the SSH nodes available using `tsh`
- List the SSH nodes available using `tctl`
- Connect to an SSH node using `tsh`
- Connect to an SSH node using OpenSSH's `ssh`

First, you'll need to adjust the role you assigned to the bot to grant it access
to SSH. This example grants access to root on all nodes. In a production setup,
it would be a good idea to restrict this to only the nodes that the bot would
need.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    # Allow login to the Linux user 'root'.
    logins: ['root']
    # Allow connection to any node. Adjust these labels to match only nodes
    # that ansible needs to access.
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

With that privileges granted, you can now create the GitHub Actions workflow.
Create `.github/workflows/example.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or Machine ID will not be
      # able to authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    # The name of the workflow, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the
    # required steps.
    name: example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: (=teleport.version=)
    - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
      id: auth
      uses: teleport-actions/auth@v2
      with:
        # Use the address of the auth/proxy server for your own cluster.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
        # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
        token: example-bot
        # Specify the length of time that the generated credentials should be
        # valid for. This is optional and defaults to "1h"
        certificate-ttl: 1h
        # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This
        # helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this
        # by omitting this.
        anonymous-telemetry: 1
    - name: List nodes (tsh)
      # Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ls" using Machine
      # ID credentials to list remote SSH nodes.
      run: tsh ls
    - name: List nodes (tctl)
      run: tctl nodes ls
    - name: Run hostname via SSH (tsh)
      # Ensure that `root` matches the username of a remote SSH username, and
      # that hostname matches an SSH host name that is a part of the Teleport
      # cluster configured for access.
      run: tsh ssh root@example-node hostname
    - name: Run hostname via SSH (OpenSSH)
      run: ssh -F ${{ steps.auth.outputs.ssh-config }} root@example-node.example.teleport.sh hostname
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or cloud
  tenant.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in a previous step.
- `example-node` with the name of a Teleport SSH node that you wish to connect
  to.
- `root` with the name of a user on the node that you are connecting to and that
  you have granted the bot access to.

Add, commit, and push your changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `example` job. The GitHub Actions workflow may take some time
to complete, and will resemble the following once successful.

![GitHub Actions](../../../../img/machine-id/github-actions.png)

Expand the **List nodes** step of the action, and the output will
list all nodes in the cluster, from the perspective of the
Machine ID bot using the command `tsh ls`.

### Example: `teleport-actions/auth-k8s`

The `teleport-actions/auth-k8s` action generates a Kubernetes output that
contains the necessary credentials and config for a Kubernetes client to connect
to a Kubernetes cluster enrolled in Teleport. The action emits the necessary
environment variable to automatically configure these clients.

In this example, the `teleport-actions/auth-k8s` action will be used to list
all the pods contained within the cluster, but this could just as easily be
modified to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl` or `helm`.

First, you'll need to adjust the role you assigned to the bot to grant it access
to the Kubernetes cluster. This example will grant the bot access to all
clusters with the group `editor`. For more detailed instructions on setting
up Kubernetes RBAC, see the Kubernetes access guide.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following rule to the Teleport role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_resources:
    - kind: pod
      namespace: "*"
      name: "*"
    kubernetes_groups:
    - editor
```

<Admonition type="note">
This example assumes the role is version `v6`. If you are using a `v7`+ role
you will need to include `verbs: ["get", "list"]` for the `kind: pod` section
in `kubernetes_resources`. Otherwise the example `kubectl get pods -A` execution
will be denied.
</Admonition>

With that privileges granted, you can now create the GitHub Actions workflow.
Create `.github/workflows/example.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started, modify it for your needs.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or Machine ID will not be
      # able to authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    name: example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch kubectl
      uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: (=teleport.version=)
    - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
      uses: teleport-actions/auth-k8s@v2
      with:
        # Use the address of the auth/proxy server for your own cluster.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
        # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
        token: example-bot
        # Use the name of your Kubernetes cluster
        kubernetes-cluster: my-kubernetes-cluster
        # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This helps us
        # shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
        # omitting this.
        anonymous-telemetry: 1
    - name: List pods
      run: kubectl get pods -A
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or cloud
  tenant.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in a previous step.
- `my-kubernetes-cluster` with the name of your Kubernetes cluster.

The `auth-k8s` action sets the `KUBECONFIG` for future steps to the credentials
it has fetched from Teleport. This means that most existing tooling for
Kubernetes (e.g `kubectl` and `helm`) can use your cluster with no additional
configuration.

Add, commit, and push this new workflow file to the default branch of your
repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `example` job.

Expand the **List pods** step of the action, where you can then confirm that the
output shows a list of all the pods within your Kubernetes cluster.

### Example: Manual configuration

To configure `tbot` manually, a YAML file will be used. In this example we'll
commit this to the repository, but this could be generated or created by the
CI pipeline itself.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: github
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the first step.

Now you can define a GitHub Actions workflow that will start `tbot` with this
configuration.

Create `.github/workflows/example-action.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or Machine ID will not be
      # able to authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    # The name of the workflow, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the
    # required steps.
    name: guide-demo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: (=teleport.version=)
    - name: Execute Machine ID
      env:
        # TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY enables the submission of anonymous
        # usage telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of
        # tbot. You can disable this by omitting this.
        TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY: 1
      run: tbot start -c ./tbot.yaml --oneshot
```

Add, commit, and push these two files to the repository. Check the GitHub
Actions UI to ensure that the workflow has succeeded.

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/configure-outputs.mdx!)

## A note on security implications and risk

Once `teleport-actions/auth` has been used in a workflow job, all successive
steps in that job will have access to the credentials which grant access to your
Teleport cluster as the bot. Where possible, run as few steps as necessary after
this action has been used. It may be a good idea to break your workflow up into
multiple jobs in order to segregate these credentials from other code running in
your CI/CD pipeline.

Most importantly, ensure that the role you assign to your GitHub Actions bot has
access to only the resources in your Teleport cluster that your CI/CD needs to
interact with.
