title: Deploying Machine ID on Azure
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on an Azure VM
---

In this guide, you will install Machine ID's agent, `tbot` on an Azure VM. The
bot will be configured to use the `azure` delegated joining method to
authenticate to your Teleport cluster. This eliminates the need for long-lived
secrets.

On the Azure platform, virtual machines can be assigned a managed identity. The
Azure platform will then make available to the virtual machine an attested
data document and JWT that allows the virtual machine to act as this identity.
This identity can be validated by a third party by attempting to use this token
to fetch it's own identity from the Azure identity service.

The `azure` join method instructs the bot to use this attested data document and
JWT to prove its identity to the Teleport Auth Server. This allows joining to
occur without the use of a long-lived secret.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- An Azure managed identity with a role granting the
  `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read` permission. You will need to know
  the UID of this identity.
- An Azure VM you wish to install Machine ID onto with the managed identity
  configured as a user-assigned managed identity.

## Step 1/5. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the Azure VM.**

First, `tbot` needs to be installed on the VM that you wish to use Machine ID
on.

Download and install the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/5. Create a Bot

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/5. Create a join token

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

Create `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name should match the name of the bot created earlier in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: azure
  azure:
    allow:
      # subscription should be the UID of an Azure subscription. Only VMs within
      # this subscription will be able to join.
    - subscription: 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
      # resource_groups allows joining to be restricted to VMs in a specific
      # resource group. It can be omitted to allow joining from any VM within
      # a subscription.
      resource_groups: ["group1"]
```

Replace:

- `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` with the UID of your Azure subscription
- `example` with the name of the bot you created in the second step
- `group1` with the name of the resource group that the VM resides within or
  omit this entirely to allow joining from any VM within the subscription

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 4/5. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the Azure VM.**

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: azure
  token: example-bot
  azure :
    client_id: 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222` with the ID of the Azure managed
  identity that has been assigned to the VM.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step.

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
