title: Deploying Machine ID on GitLab CI
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on GitLab CI
---

In this guide, you will use Teleport Machine ID to allow a GitLab pipeline to
securely connect to a Teleport SSH node without the need for long-lived secrets.

Machine ID for GitLab works with GitLab's cloud-hosted option and with
self-hosted GitLab installations. **The minimum supported GitLab version is
15.7**.

This mitigates the risk of long-lived secrets such as passwords or SSH private
keys being exfiltrated from your GitLab organization and provides many of
the other benefits of Teleport such as auditing and finely-grained access
control.

## Prerequisites

Machine ID for GitLab is available starting from Teleport `v12.2`.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A GitLab project to connect to Teleport. This can either be on GitLab's
cloud-hosted offering (gitlab.com) or on a self-hosted GitLab instance. **When
using a self-hosted GitLab instance, your Teleport Auth Server must be able to
connect to your GitLab instance and your GitLab instance must be configured with
a valid TLS certificate.**

## Step 1/4. Create a Bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 2/4. Create a join token

To allow GitLab CI to authenticate to your Teleport cluster, you'll first need
to create a join token. A GitLab join token contains allow rules that describe
which pipelines can use that token in order to join the Teleport cluster. A rule
can contain multiple fields, and any pipeline that matches all the fields
within a single rule is granted access.

In this example, you will create a token with a rule that grants access to any
GitLab CI job within a specific GitLab project. Determine the fully qualified
path of your GitLab project. This will include your username (or group) and the
name of your project, e.g `my-user/my-project`.

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`. Ensure you substitute any values as
suggested by the comments in this example:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  # The Bot role indicates that this token grants access to a bot user, rather
  # than allowing a node to join. This role is built in to Teleport.
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: gitlab
  # The bot_name indicates which bot user this token grants access to. This
  # should match the name of the bot that you created in step 1.
  bot_name: example
  gitlab:
    # domain should be the domain of your GitLab instance. If you are using
    # GitLab's cloud hosted offering, omit this field entirely.
    domain: gitlab.example.com
    # allow specifies rules that control which GitLab tokens will be accepted
    # by Teleport. Tokens not matching any allow rule will be denied.
    allow:
        # project_path should be the fully qualified path of your GitLab
        # project that you determined earlier. This will grant access to any
        # GitLab CI run in that project.
      - project_path: my-user/my-project
```

You can find a full list of the token configuration options for GitLab joining
on the
[GitLab CI reference page.](../reference/gitlab.mdx#gitlab-join-token)

Apply this to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 3/4. Configure a GitLab Pipeline

With the bot and join token created, you can now configure a GitLab pipeline
that sets up `tbot` to use these.

To configure `tbot`, a YAML file will be used. In this example we'll store this
within the repository itself, but this could be generated or created by the
CI pipeline itself.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: gitlab
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step

Now, the GitLab CI pipeline can be defined. Before the pipeline can use `tbot`,
it must be available within the environment. For this example, we'll show
downloading `tbot` as part of the CI step, but in a production implementation
you may wish to build a docker image that contains this binary to avoid
depending on the Teleport CDN.

Create `.gitlab-ci.yml`  within your repository:

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  # id_tokens configures ID Tokens that GitLab will automatically inject into
  # the environment of your GitLab run.
  #
  # See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html
  # for further explanation of the id_tokens configuration in GitLab.
  id_tokens:
    TBOT_GITLAB_JWT:
      # aud for TBOT_GITLAB_JWT must be configured with the name of your
      # Teleport cluster. This is not necessarily the address of your Teleport
      # cluster and will not include a port or scheme (http/https)
      #
      # This helps the Teleport Auth Server know that the token is intended for
      # it, and not a different service or Teleport cluster.
      aud: teleport.example.com
  script:
    - cd /tmp
    - 'curl -O https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz'
    - tar -xvf teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
    - sudo ./teleport/install
    - 'TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1 tbot start -c tbot.yaml'
```

Replace `teleport.example.com` with the name of your Teleport cluster. This
is not necessarily the address of your Teleport cluster and will not include
a port or scheme (e.g. http/https).

`TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY` enables the submission of anonymous usage
telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable
this by omitting this.

Commit and push these two files to the repository.

Check your GitLab CI status, and examine the log results from the commit for
failure.
