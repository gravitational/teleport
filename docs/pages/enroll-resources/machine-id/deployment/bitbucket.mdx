title: Deploying Machine ID on Bitbucket Pipelines
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on Bitbucket Pipelines
---

In this guide, you will configure Machine ID's agent, `tbot`, to run within a
Bitbucket Pipelines workflow. The bot will be configured to use the `bitbucket`
delegated joining method to eliminate the need for long-lived secrets.

## How it works

The `bitbucket` join method is a secure way for Machine ID bots to authenticate
with the Teleport Auth Service without using any shared secrets. Instead, it
makes use of an OpenID Connect token that Bitbucket Pipelines injects into the
job environment.

This token is sent to the Teleport Auth Service, and assuming it has been
configured to trust Bitbucket's identity provider and all identity assertions
match, the authentication attempt will succeed.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A Bitbucket repository you can push to.

## Step 1/5. Determine Bitbucket configuration

Bitbucket joining requires a number of configuration parameters that can be
found in your repository settings. From the Bitbucket repository, navigate to
"Repository settings", then in the sidebar under "Pipelines" select "OpenID
Connect".

From this page, note the following values:
- Identity provider URL (<Var name="identity-provider-url" />)
- Audience (<Var name="audience" />)
- Workspace UUID, including the braces (<Var name="workspace-uuid" />)
- Repository UUID, including the braces (<Var name="repository-uuid" />)

## Step 2/5. Create the Machine ID bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/5. Create the join token for Bitbucket Pipelines

In order to allow your Pipelines workflow to authenticate with your Teleport
cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out criteria
by which the Auth Service decides whether or not to allow a bot or node to join.

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`, ensuring that you replace the
`identity_provider_url`, `audience`, `workspace_uuid`, and `repository_uuid`
with the values from Step 1.

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: bitbucket
  bot_name: example
  bitbucket:
    identity_provider_url: <Var name="identity-provider-url" />
    audience: <Var name="audience" />
    # allow specifies the rules by which the Auth Service determines if `tbot`
    # should be allowed to join.
    allow:
    - workspace_uuid: <Var name="workspace-uuid" />
      repository_uuid: <Var name="repository-uuid" />
```

Let's go over the token resource's fields in more detail:

- `metadata.name` defines the name of the token. Note that this value will need
  to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `spec.bot_name` is the name of the Machine ID bot that this token will grant
  access to. Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the
  configuration later.
- `spec.roles` defines which roles that this token will grant access to. The
  value of `[Bot]` states that this token grants access to a Machine ID bot.
- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since
  this guide only focuses on Bitbucket Pipelines, you will set this to to
  `bitbucket`.
- `spec.bitbucket.identity_provider_url` is the identity provider URL shown in
  the Bitbucket repository settings, under Pipelines and OpenID Connect.
- `spec.bitbucket.audience` is the audience value shown in the Bitbucket
  repository settings, under Pipelines and OpenID connect.
- `spec.bitbucket.allow` is used to set rules for what Bitbucket Pipelines runs
   will be able to authenticate by using the token.

Refer to the [token reference](../../../reference/join-methods.mdx#bitbucket-pipelines-bitbucket)
for a full list of valid fields.

Apply this to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 4/5. Configure a Bitbucket Pipelines workflow

With the bot and join token created, you can now configure a workflow that can
authenticate to Teleport.

To configure `tbot`, a YAML file will be used. In this example we'll store this
within the repository itself, but this could be generated or created by the
CI pipeline itself.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: bitbucket
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy. If
  connecting directly to an Auth Service, replace `proxy_server:` with
  `auth_server:`.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step

Next, define a Pipelines workflow that downloads the `tbot` binary and starts
it using the `tbot.yaml` configured above. This example workflow defines
a "custom" pipeline that can be triggered manually from "Pipelines" or
"Branches" views, but any type of workflow may be used:

```yaml
image: atlassian/default-image:3

pipelines:
  custom:
    run-tbot:
      - step:
          oidc: true
          script:
            # Download and extract Teleport
            - wget https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
            - tar -xvf teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz

            # Run `tbot` in identity mode for SSH access
            - ./teleport/tbot start -c tbot.yaml
```

Once run, tbot will start and authenticate to Teleport. Note that at this point,
no outputs will have been configured so it will not yet have credentials to
connect to any resources.

If you're adapting an existing workflow, note these steps:
1. Set `oidc: true` on the step properties so that step will be issued a token
1. Download and extract a `.tar.gz` Teleport build
1. Run `tbot start -c tbot.yaml` with the configuration file defined above

<Admonition type="warning" title="Sharing credentials between steps">
Note that in Bitbucket Pipelines, outputs cannot be securely shared between
steps as anything stored using `artifacts` will remain downloadable once the CI
run has completed.

Due to this limitation, all operations making use of Teleport credentials should
be performed as part of the same step. If necessary, you can duplicate the
script shown here to download and run `tbot` multiple times in a given run if
credentials are needed in multiple steps.

## Step 5/5. Configure outputs

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/configure-outputs.mdx!)

## Further steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides/access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../../../reference/machine-id/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
