title: Deploying Machine ID on Linux
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on a Linux host
---

This page explains how to deploy Machine ID on a Linux host.

The process in which `tbot` initially authenticates with the Teleport cluster is
known as joining. A join method is a specific technique for the bot to prove its
identity.

On platforms where there is no form of identity available to the machine, the
only available join method is `token`. The `token` join method is special as
it is the only join method that relies on a shared secret. In order to mitigate
the risks associated with this, the `token` join method is single use and it
is not possible to use the same token multiple times.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A Linux host that you wish to install Machine ID onto.
- A Linux user on that host that you wish Machine ID to run as. In the guide,
  we will use `teleport` for this.

## Step 1/4. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the Linux host.**

First, `tbot` needs to be installed on the VM that you wish to use Machine ID
on.

Download the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/4. Create a bot user

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

Create the bot:

```code
$ tctl bots add example
```

A join token will be included in the results of `tctl bots add`, record this
value as it will be needed when configuring `tbot`.

## Step 3/4. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the Linux host.**

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: token
  token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:
- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Service. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `(=presets.tokens.first=)` with the token that was returned by `tctl bots add`
  in the previous step.

<Admonition type="note">
The first time that `tbot` runs, this token will be exchanged for a certificate
that the bot uses for authentication. At this point, the token is invalidated.
This means you may remove the token from the configuration file after the first
run has completed, but there is no tangible security benefit to doing so.
</Admonition>

### Prepare the storage directory

When using the `token` join method, `tbot` must be able to persist its state
across restarts. The destination used to persist this state is known as the
bot's "storage destination". In this guide, the directory
`/var/lib/teleport/bot` will be used.

As this directory will store the bots sensitive credentials, it is important
to protect it. To do this, you will configure the directory to only be
accessible to the Linux user which `tbot` will run as.

Execute the following, replacing `teleport` with the Linux user that you will
run `tbot` as:

```code
# Make the bot directory and assign ownership to teleport user
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/teleport/bot
$ sudo chown teleport:teleport /var/lib/teleport/bot
```

### Create a systemd service

## Step 4/4. Configure outputs

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/configure-outputs.mdx!)

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides/access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../../../reference/machine-id/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
