title: Deploying Machine ID on GCP
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on a GCP VM
---

This guide explains how to deploy Machine ID on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) by
running the `tbot` binary and joining it to your Teleport cluster.

On GCP, virtual machines can be assigned a service account. These machines can
then request a signed JSON web token from GCP, which allows third parties to
verify information about them, including their service accounts, using the GCP
public key. The Teleport `gcp` join method instructs a Machine ID bot to use
this service account JWT to prove its identity to the Teleport Auth Service and
join your Teleport cluster without using long-lived secrets.

Whilst the guide on this page focuses explicitly on deploying Machine ID on a
GCP Virtual Machine, it is also possible to use the `gcp` join method with
workloads  running on Google Kubernetes Engine. To do so, you must configure
[GCP Workload
Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity)
for the cluster and the Kubernetes service account that will be used by the
`tbot` pod. See the [Kubernetes platform guide](kubernetes.mdx) for further
guidance on deploying Machine ID as a workload on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A GCP service account you wish to grant access to your Teleport cluster that
  is not the GCP compute default service account.
- A GCP Compute Engine VM that you wish to install Machine ID onto that has
  been configured with the GCP service account.

## Step 1/4. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the GCP VM.**

First, `tbot` needs to be installed on the VM that you wish to use Machine ID
on.

Download and install the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/4. Create a join token, role and bot user

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/blank-role.mdx!)

Create `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name will match the name of the bot created later in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: gcp
  gcp:
    # allow specifies the rules by which the Auth Server determines if `tbot`
    # should be allowed to join.
    allow:
    - project_ids:
        - my-project-123456
      service_accounts:
        # This should be the full "name" of a GCP service account. The default
        # compute service account is not supported.
        - my-service-account@my-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Replace:

- `my-project-123456` with the ID of your GCP project
- `my-service-account@my-project-123456.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with the email
  of the service account configured in the previous step. The default compute
  service account is not supported.

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

Create the bot, specifying the token and role that you have created:

```code
$ tctl bots add example --token example-bot --roles example-bot
```

## Step 3/4. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the GCP VM.**

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: gcp
  token: example-bot
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step.

## Step 4/4. Configure outputs

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/configure-outputs.mdx!)

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
