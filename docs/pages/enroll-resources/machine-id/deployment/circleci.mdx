title: Deploying Machine ID on CircleCI
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on CircleCI
---

In this guide, you will configure Machine ID's agent, `tbot`, to run within a
CircleCI workflow. The bot will be configured to use the `circleci` delegated
joining method to eliminate the need for long-lived secrets.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A CircleCI project connected to a Git repository you can push to.

## Step 1/5. Configure CircleCI

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/recover-circle-ci-claims.mdx!)

## Step 2/5. Create the Machine ID bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/5. Create the join token for CircleCI

In order to allow your CircleCI workflow to authenticate with your Teleport
cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out criteria
by which the Auth Server decides whether or not to allow a bot or node to join.

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`, ensuring that you replace
<Var name="organization-id" /> and <Var name="context-id" /> with the values from Step 1.

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: circleci
  bot_name: example
  circleci:
    organization_id: <Var name="organization-id" />
    # allow specifies the rules by which the Auth Server determines if `tbot`
    # should be allowed to join.
    allow:
    - context_id: <Var name="context-id" />
```

Let's go over the token resource's fields in more detail:

- `metadata.name` defines the name of the token. Note that this value will need
to be used in other parts of the configuration later.
- `metadata.expires` defines the date that the join token will expire. This
example is set to the year `2100`.
- `spec.bot_name` is the name of the Machine ID bot that this token will grant
access to. Note that this value will need to be used in other parts of the
configuration later.
- `spec.roles` defines which roles that this token will grant access to. The
value of `[Bot]` states that this token grants access to a Machine ID bot.
- `spec.join_method` defines the join method the token is applicable for. Since
this guide only focuses on CircleCI, you will set this to to `circleci`.
- `spec.circleci.allow` is used to set rules for what CircleCI runs will be able
to authenticate by using the token.

Apply this to your Teleport cluster using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 4/5. Configure a CircleCI workflow

With the bot and join token created, you can now configure a CircleCI
workflow that can connect to your Teleport cluster.

To configure `tbot`, a YAML file will be used. In this example we'll store this
within the repository itself, but this could be generated or created by the
CI pipeline itself.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: circleci
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step

Now, the CircleCI pipeline can be defined. Before the pipeline can use `tbot`,
it must be available within the environment. For this example, we'll show
downloading `tbot` as part of the CI step, but in a production implementation
you may wish to build a docker image that contains this binary to avoid
depending on the Teleport CDN.

Open your Git repository and create a directory called `.circleci`. Then open
a file called `config.yml` and insert the following configuration:

```yaml
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
version: 2.1
jobs:
  write-run-log:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: "Install Teleport"
          command: |
            cd /tmp
            curl -O https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
            tar -xvf teleport-v(=teleport.version=)-linux-amd64-bin.tar.gz
            sudo ./teleport/install
      - run:
          name: "Run Machine ID"
          command: |
            export TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1
            tbot start -c tbot.yaml
workflows:
  write-run-log:
    jobs:
      - write-run-log:
          context:
            - <Var name="teleport-access"/>
```

`TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY` enables the submission of anonymous usage
telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable
this by omitting this.

Add, commit, and push these two configuration files to your repository.

Open CircleCI and check the status of the job, wait for it to complete and
ensure that no errors are emitted.

### A note on security implications and risk

Once `tbot start` has been used in a job, all successive steps in that job will
have access to the credentials that have been produced by `tbot`. Break your
workflow down into multiple jobs to reduce the amount of steps that have access
to these credentials.

Ensure that the role you assign to your CircleCI bot has access to only the
resources in your Teleport cluster that your CI/CD needs to interact with.

## Further steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides/access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../../../reference/machine-id/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
- For more information about CircleCI itself, read
  [their documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/).
