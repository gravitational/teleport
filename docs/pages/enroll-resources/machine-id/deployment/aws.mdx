title: Deploying Machine ID on AWS
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on an AWS EC2 instance
---

This guide explains how to deploy Machine ID on Amazon Web Services by running
the `tbot` binary and joining it to your Teleport cluster.

On AWS, virtual machines can be assigned an IAM role, which they can assume in
order to request a signed document that includes information about the machine.
The Teleport `iam` join method instructs the Machine ID bot to request this
signed document from AWS using the assigned identity and send it to the Teleport
Auth Service for verification. This allows the bot to join the cluster without
the exchange of a long-lived secret.

While this guide focuses on deploying Machine ID on an EC2 instance, it is also
possible to use the `iam` join method with workloads running on an EKS
Kubernetes cluster. To do so, you must configure [IAM Roles for Service Accounts
(IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
for the cluster and the Kubernetes service account that will be used by the
`tbot` pod. See the [Kubernetes platform guide](kubernetes.mdx) for further
guidance on deploying Machine ID as a workload on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- An AWS IAM role that you wish to grant access to your Teleport cluster. This
  role must be granted `sts:GetCallerIdentity`. In this guide, this role will
  be named `teleport-bot-role`.
- An AWS EC2 virtual machine that you wish to install Machine ID onto configured
  with the IAM role attached.

## Step 1/4. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the AWS EC2 instance.**

First, `tbot` needs to be installed on the VM that you wish to use Machine ID
on.

Download and install the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/4. Create a role and bot user

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/blank-role.mdx!)

Create `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name will match the name of the bot created later in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: iam
  # Restrict the AWS account and (optionally) ARN that can use this token.
  # This information can be obtained from running the
  # "aws sts get-caller-identity" command from the CLI.
  allow:
    - aws_account: "111111111111"
      aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/teleport-bot-role/i-*"
```

Replace:

- `111111111111` with the ID of your AWS account.
- `teleport-bot-role` with the name of the AWS IAM role you created and assigned
  to the EC2 instance.
- `i-*` indicates that any instance with the specified role can use the join
  method. If you wish to restrict this to an individual instance, replace `i-*`
  with the full instance ID.

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

Create the bot, specifying the token and role that you have created:

```code
$ tctl bots add example --token example-bot --roles example-bot
```

## Step 3/4. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the AWS EC2 instance.**

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: iam
  token: example-bot
storage:
  type: memory
# outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
outputs: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or
  Auth Server. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step.

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/daemon-or-oneshot.mdx!)

## Step 4/4. Configure outputs

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/configure-outputs.mdx!)

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
