title: Deploying Machine ID on Kubernetes
description: How to install and configure Machine ID on Kubernetes
---

This guide shows you how to deploy the Machine ID daemon `tbot`, on a Kubernetes
cluster.

In the setup we demonstrate in this guide, `tbot` runs as a Kubernetes
deployment. It writes output credentials to a Kubernetes secret, which can then
be mounted in the pods that need to use the credentials. While `tbot` can also
run as a sidecar within the same pod as the service that needs to use the
credentials it generates, we recommend running `tbot` as a standalone deployment
due the limited support Kubernetes has for sidecars.

In this guide, we demonstrate the `kubernetes` join method, in which `tbot`
proves its identity to the Teleport Auth Service by presenting a JSON web token
(JWT) signed by the Kubernetes API server. This JWT contains identifies the
service account, the pod and the namespace in which `tbot` is running. The
Teleport Auth Service checks the signature of the JWT against the Kubernetes
cluster's public signing key.

<Details title="Using another join method">

When deploying `tbot` to a Teleport cluster, it is generally recommended to use
the `kubernetes` join method. This will work with most Kubernetes clusters.
The guide that follows will demonstrate configuring this join method.

However, when using certain cloud Kubernetes services, it is possible to use the
join method associated with that platform rather than the `kubernetes` join
method. This may be beneficial if you wish to manage the joining of `tbot`
within the Kubernetes clusters and on standard VMs on the same platform with
a single join token. These services are:

- Google Kubernetes Engine: Where
  [GCP Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity)
  is configured for the cluster, it is possible to use the `gcp` join method.
  See the [GCP Platform Guide](./gcp.mdx) for further information.
- AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service: Where
  [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html)
  is configured for the cluster, it is possible to use the `iam` join method.
  See the [AWS Platform Guide](./aws.mdx) for further information.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A Kubernetes cluster with support for Token Request Projection (which
  graduated to a generally available feature in Kubernetes 1.20).
- `kubectl` authenticated with the ability to create resources in the cluster
  you wish to deploy `tbot` into.

The examples in this guide will install a `tbot` deployment in the `default`
Namespace of the Kubernetes cluster. Adjust references to `default` to the
Namespace you wish to use.

## Step 1/5. Prepare Kubernetes RBAC

In order to prepare the Kubernetes cluster for Machine ID, several Kubernetes
RBAC resources must be created.

A ServiceAccount will be created and later assigned to the Pod that will run
`tbot`. This creates a static identity that we can allow access to join the
Teleport Cluster and also provides an identity to which we can assign Kubernetes
privileges.

A Role granting the ability to read and write to secrets in the Namespace will
be created and then assigned to the ServiceAccount using a RoleBinding. This
will allow the `tbot` Pod to read and write credentials to a Secret.

Create a file called `k8s-rbac.yaml`:

```yaml
# This ServiceAccount will be used to give the `tbot` pods a discrete identity
# which can be validated by the Teleport Auth Server.
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tbot
  namespace: default
---
# This role grants the ability to manage secrets within the namespace - this is
# necessary for the `kubernetes_secret` destination to work correctly.
#
# You may wish to add the `resourceNames` field to the role to further restrict
# this access in sensitive environments.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: secrets-admin
  namespace: default
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["*"]
---
# Bind the role to the service account created for tbot.
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tbot-secrets-admin
  namespace: default
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tbot
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name:  secrets-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply this file to your Kubernetes cluster:

```code
$ kubectl apply -f ./k8s-rbac.yaml
```

## Step 2/5. Create a Bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/5. Create a join token

Next, a join token needs to be configured. This will be used by `tbot` to join
the cluster. As the `kubernetes` join method will be used, the public key of the
Kubernetes cluster must first be determined. The public key used to sign JWTs
is exposed on the "JWKS" endpoint of the Kubernetes API server. This public key
can then be used by the Teleport Auth  to verify that the Service Account JWT
presented by `tbot` is signed legitimately by the Kubernetes cluster.

Run the following commands to determine the JWKS formatted public key:

```code
$ kubectl proxy -p 8080
$ curl http://localhost:8080/openid/v1/jwks
{"keys":[--snip--]}%
```

Create `bot-token.yaml`, ensuring you insert the value from the JWKS endpoint
in `spec.kubernetes.static_jwks.jwks`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name should match the name of the bot created earlier in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: kubernetes
  kubernetes:
    # static_jwks configures the Auth Server to validate the JWT presented by
    # `tbot` using the public key from a statically configured JWKS.
    type: static_jwks
    static_jwks:
      jwks: |
        # Place the data returned by the curl command here
        {"keys":[--snip--]}
    # allow specifies the rules by which the Auth Server determines if `tbot`
    # should be allowed to join.
    allow:
    - service_account: "default:tbot" # service_account
```

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 4/5. Create a `tbot` deployment

First, a ConfigMap will be created to contain the configuration file for `tbot`.
This will then be mounted into the Pod.

Create `k8s-deployment-config.yaml`, replacing the value of `token` with the
name of the token you created earlier and the value of `proxy_server` with the
address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tbot-config
  namespace: default
data:
  tbot.yaml: |
    version: v2
    onboarding:
      join_method: kubernetes
      # ensure token is set to the name of the join token you created earlier
      token: bot-kubernetes
    storage:
      # a memory destination is used for the bots own state since the kubernetes
      # join method does not require persistence.
      type: memory
    # ensure this is configured to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
    proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
    # outputs will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
    outputs: []
```

Apply this file to your Kubernetes cluster:

```code
$ kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment-config.yaml
```

With the ConfigMap created, you can now create the `tbot` deployment itself.

Create `k8s-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: tbot
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: tbot
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: tbot
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: tbot
          image: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/tbot-distroless:(=teleport.version=)
          args:
            - start
            - -c
            - /config/tbot.yaml
          env:
            # POD_NAMESPACE is required for the kubernetes_secret` destination
            # type to work correctly.
            - name: POD_NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
            # KUBERNETES_TOKEN_PATH specifies the path to the service account
            # JWT to use for joining.
            # This path is based on the configuration of the volume and
            # volumeMount.
            - name: KUBERNETES_TOKEN_PATH
              value: /var/run/secrets/tokens/join-sa-token
            # TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY enables the submission of anonymous
            # usage telemetry.  This helps us shape the future development of
            # `tbot`. You can disable this by omitting this.
            - name: TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY
              value: "1"
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /config
              name: config
            - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
              name: join-sa-token
      serviceAccountName: tbot
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: tbot-config
        - name: join-sa-token
          projected:
            sources:
              - serviceAccountToken:
                  path: join-sa-token
                  # 600 seconds is the minimum that Kubernetes supports. We
                  # recommend this value is used.
                  expirationSeconds: 600
                  # `example.teleport.sh` must be replaced with the name of
                  # your Teleport cluster.
                  audience: example.teleport.sh
```

Replace `example.teleport.sh` with the name of your Teleport cluster - this is
not necessarily the public address (the port should not be included).

This is an example manifest, consider modifying it to fit within the conventions
of deployments to your clusters (e.g customizing labels).

<Admonition type="warning" title="FIPS Compliance">
The default `tbot-distroless` image does not contain the FIPS-compliant
binaries. If you operate in an environment where FIPS compliance is required,
please use the `tbot-fips-distroless` image instead.
</Admonition>

Apply this file to your Kubernetes cluster:

```code
$ kubectl apply -f ./k8s-deployment.yaml
```

Use `kubectl` to verify that the deployment is healthy:

```code
$ kubectl describe deployment/tbot
$ kubectl logs deployment/tbot
```

With this complete, `tbot` is now successfully deployed to your cluster.
However, it is not yet producing any useful output.

## Step 5/5. Configure outputs

Follow one of the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to configure an output
that meets your access needs.

In order to adjust the access guides to work well with Kubernetes, use the
Kubernetes Secret destination type. This will write the generated artifacts
to a specified Kubernetes Secret, for example:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: identity
    destination:
      type: kubernetes_secret
      name: identity-output
```

The output can then be consumed by mounting this secret within another pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: tsh
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - name: tsh
      image: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless:(=teleport.version=)
      command:
        - tsh
      args:
       - -i
       - /identity-output/identity
       - --proxy
       - example.teleport.sh:443
       - ls
      volumeMounts:
        - name: identity-output
          mountPath: /identity-output
  volumes:
    - name: identity-output
      secret:
        secretName: identity-output
```

## Next steps

- Follow the [access guides](../access-guides.mdx) to finish configuring `tbot` for
  your environment.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
