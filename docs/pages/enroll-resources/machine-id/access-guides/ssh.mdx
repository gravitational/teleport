description: How to use Machine ID to access servers via SSH

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/v2-config-warning.mdx!)

Teleport protects and controls SSH access to servers. Machine ID
can be used to grant machines secure, short-lived access to these servers.

In this guide, you will configure `tbot` to produce credentials that can be
used to access a Linux server enrolled in Teleport. The guide
will cover access using the Teleport CLI `tsh` as well as the OpenSSH client.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- If you have not already connected your server to Teleport, follow
  the [Server Access Getting Started Guide](../../application-access/getting-started.mdx).
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the machine that will
  connect to Linux hosts with SSH. For more information, see the
  [deployment guides](../deployment.mdx).

## Step 1/3. Configure RBAC

First, Teleport must be configured to allow the credentials produced by the bot
to connect to SSH servers in your infrastructure. In this example, access will
be granted to all SSH nodes for the username `root`. This is done by creating a
role that grants the necessary permissions and then assigning this role to a
Bot.

Create a file called `role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    # Allow login to the Linux user 'root'.
    logins: ['root']
    # Allow connection to any node. Adjust these labels to match only nodes
    # that ansible needs to access.
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Replace `example-role` with a descriptive name related to your use case.

You may also wish to adjust this to grant access to a user other than `root`
depending on what commands will need to be executed with the credentials.

For production use, you should adjust `node_labels` to restrict this access to
only the hosts that the bot will need to access. This is known as the principle
of least privilege and limits the damage that exfiltrated credentials can do.

Use `tctl create -f ./role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and `example-role`
with the name of the role you just created:

```bash
$ tctl bots update example --add-roles example-role
```

## Step 2/3. Configure the `tbot` output

Now, `tbot` needs to be configured with an output that will produce an
SSH certificate and OpenSSH configuration. For this we use the `identity` output
type.

Outputs must be configured with a destination. In this example, the `directory`
destination will be used. This will write these credentials to a specified
directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can be written to by the Linux
user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by the Linux user that needs
to use SSH.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to use the credentials
produced by `tbot` to connect to nodes via SSH.

## Step 3/3. Using the output credentials

Once `tbot` has been run or restarted, you should now see several files under
`/opt/machine-id`:

- `identity`: this is a bundle of credentials that can be used by `tsh` to
  authenticate.
- `ssh_config`: this can be used with OpenSSH and other tools to configure them
  to use the Teleport Proxy Service with the correct credentials when making
  connections.
- `known_hosts`: this contains the Teleport SSH host CAs and allows the SSH
  client to validate a host's certificate.
- `key-cert.pub`: this is an SSH certificate signed by the Teleport SSH user
  CA.
- `key`: this is the private key needed to use the SSH certificate.

These credentials can be used with Teleport's CLI `tsh` or with OpenSSH client
tools like `ssh` and `sftp`.

### Connecting using `tsh`

To use `tsh` with a `tbot` identity output, the path to the `identity` file
must be specified using the `-i` flag. In addition, `--proxy` must be used to
specify the address of the Teleport Proxy Service that should be used when making
connections.

In this example, `tsh` is used to connect to a node called `my-host` via the
proxy `example.teleport.sh:443` and to execute the command `hostname`:

```code
$ tsh -i /opt/machine-id/identity --proxy example.teleport.sh:443 ssh root@my-host hostname
my-host
```

### Connecting using OpenSSH

To use OpenSSH with the identity output, the path to the `ssh_config` should be
provided to `ssh` with the `-F` flag.

With the generated `ssh_config` you must append the name of the Teleport cluster
to the name of the node - in this example, the command `hostname` is
executed as `root` on the node `my-host` belonging to the cluster
`example.teleport.sh`.

```code
$ ssh -F /opt/machine-id/ssh_config root@my-host.example.teleport.sh hostname
my-host
```

<Notice type="warning">
  The `ssh_config` for OpenSSH requires that `tsh` is installed. This is
  necessary as `tsh` is used to make the OpenSSH client compatible with
  Teleport's port multiplexing.
</Notice>

### Connecting using other tools

To integrate with other SSH tools, first determine whether the `ssh_config`
is compatible with them. This is the case for many tools such as Ansible and the
guidance provided under "Connecting using OpenSSH" should be sufficient.

If you wish to integrate with Ansible, check out the
[Ansible-specific guide](./ansible.mdx).

If your tool is not compatible with `ssh_config`, it may still be possible to
configure it to use the credentials produced by Machine ID. It must support
SSH client certificates and either ProxyCommand or ProxyJump functionality.
