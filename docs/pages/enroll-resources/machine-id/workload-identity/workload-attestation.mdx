<Admonition type="tip" title="Preview">
Teleport Workload Identity is currently in Preview. This means that some
features may be missing. We're actively looking for design partners to help us
shape the future of Workload Identity and would love to
[hear your feedback](mailto:product@goteleport.com).

Workload Attestation is the process of verifying the identity of a workload that
has connected to the Workload API. Workload attestors resolve the process ID
of the workload against platform-specific APIs to determine more information
(known as attestation metadata) about the workload. This information can then
be used to make decisions about which SPIFFE IDs should be issued to the
workload.

## Unix

The Unix Workload Attestor is the most basic attestor and allows you to restrict
the issuance of SVIDs to specific Unix processes based on a range of criteria.

### Attestation Metadata

- `unix.attestated`: indicates that the workload has been attested by the Unix
  Workload Attestor.
- `unix.pid`: the process ID of the attested workload.
- `unix.uid`: the effective user ID of the attested workload.
- `unix.gid`: the effective primary group ID of the attested workload.

## Kubernetes

The Kubernetes Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of SVIDs
to specific Kubernetes workloads based on a range of criteria.

It works by first determining the pod ID for a given process ID and then by
querying the local kubelet API for details about that pod.

### Attestation Metadata

- `kubernetes.attestated`: indicates that the workload has been attested by the
  Kubernetes Workload Attestor.
- `kubernetes.namespace`: the namespace of the Kubernetes Pod.
- `kubernetes.service_account`: the service account of the Kubernetes Pod.
- `kubernetes.pod_name`: the name of the Kubernetes Pod.

### Deployment Guidance

To use Kubernetes Workload Attestation, `tbot` must be deployed as a daemon
set. This is because the unix domain socket can only be accessed by pods on the
same node as the agent. Additionally, the daemon set must have the `hostPID`
property set to `true` to allow the agent to access information about
processes within other containers.

The daemon set must also have a service account assigned that allows it to query
the Kubelet API. This is an example role with the required RBAC:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tbot
rules:
  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]
    apiGroups: [""]
    verbs: ["get"]
```

Mapping the Workload API Unix domain socket into the containers of workloads
can be done in two ways:

- Directly configuring a hostPath volume for the `tbot` daemonset and workloads
  which will need to connect to it.
- Using [spiffe-csi-driver](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe-csi).

Example manifests for required Kubernetes resources:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: tbot
rules:
  - resources: ["pods","nodes","nodes/proxy"]
    apiGroups: [""]
    verbs: ["get"]
