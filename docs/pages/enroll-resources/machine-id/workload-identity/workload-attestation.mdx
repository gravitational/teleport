## Unix Workload Attestation

## Kubernetes Workload Attestation

The Kubernetes Workload Attestor allows you to restrict the issuance of SVIDs
to specific Kubernetes workloads based on a range of criteria. Workloads connect
to the Workload API using a Unix Domain Socket and the Kubernetes Workload
Attestor is able to identify the workload by resolving the process ID to an
individual Kubernetes Pod.

To use Kubernetes Workload Attestation, `tbot` is deployed as a

To function, the Kubernetes Workload Attestor depends on the ability:

- The ability to view the un-namespaced process ID of the workload. This is
typically achieved by setting `hostPID: true` in the PodSpec.
- The ability to query the Kubelet API to determine further information about
a Pod from its ID.
