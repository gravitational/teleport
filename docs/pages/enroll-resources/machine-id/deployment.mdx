The first step to set up Machine ID is to deploy the `tbot` binary and join a
Machine ID bot to your Teleport cluster. You can run the `tbot` binary on a
number of platforms, from AWS and GitHub Actions to a generic Linux server or
Kubernetes cluster. This guide shows you how to deploy Machine ID on your
infrastructure.

## Choosing a deployment method

There are two considerations to make when determining how to deploy Machine ID on
your infrastructure.

### Your infrastructure

The `tbot` binary runs as a container or on a Linux virtual machine. If you run
`tbot` on GitHub Actions, you can use one of the ready-made [Teleport GitHub
Actions workflows](https://github.com/teleport-actions).

### Join method

Machine ID joins your Teleport cluster by using one of the following
authentication methods:

- **Platform-signed document:** The platform that hosts `tbot`, such as a
  Kubernetes cluster or Amazon EC2 instance, provides a signed identity document
  that Teleport can verify using the platform's certificate authority. This is
  the recommended approach because it avoids the use of shared secrets.
- **Static join token:** Your Teleport client tool generates a string and stores
  it on the Teleport Auth Service. Machine ID provides this string when it first
  connects to your Teleport cluster, demonstrating to the Auth Service that it
  belongs in the cluster. From then on, Machine ID authenticates to your
  Teleport cluster with a renewable certificate.

## Deployment guides

The guides in this section show you how to deploy Machine ID and join it
to your cluster. Choose a guide based on the platform where you intend to run
Machine ID.

If a specific guide does not exist for your platform, the [Linux
guide](./deployment/linux.mdx) is compatible with most platforms. For
custom approaches, you can also read the [Machine ID Reference](./reference.mdx)
and [Architecture](./architecture.mdx) to plan your deployment.

### Self-hosted infrastructure

Read the following guides for how to deploy Machine ID on your cloud platform or
on-prem infrastructure.
