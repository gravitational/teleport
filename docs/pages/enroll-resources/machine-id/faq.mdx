## Can Machine ID be used within CI/CD jobs?

On CI/CD platforms where your workflow runs in an ephemeral environment (e.g
no persistent state exists between individual workflow runs), Machine ID works
best where a supported join method exists. These are:

- GitHub Actions
- CircleCI
- GitLab
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure
- Kubernetes
- Spacelift

On CI/CD platforms where you control the runner environment (e.g self-hosted
Jenkins runner), Machine ID can run as a daemon on the runner and the generated
credentials can be mounted into the environment of your individual workflow
runs.

## Can Machine ID be used with Trusted Clusters ?

From Teleport 12.2, you can use Machine ID for SSH Access in trusted leaf clusters.

We currently do not support access to applications, databases, or Kubernetes
clusters in leaf clusters.

## Should I define allowed logins as user traits or within roles?

When defining the logins that your bot will be allowed to use, there are two
options:

- Directly adding the login to the `logins` section of the role that your bot
  will impersonate.
- Adding the login to the logins trait of the bot user, and impersonating a role
  that includes the `{{ internal.logins }}` role variable. This is usually done
  by providing the `--logins` parameter when creating the bot.

For simpler scenarios — where you only expect the bot to use a single output
or role — you can add the login to the logins trait of the bot user. This
approach allows you to leverage default roles like `access`.

For situations where your bot is producing certificates for different roles in
different outputs, it is important to consider whether using a login trait
grants access to resources that you didn't intend. To prevent a login trait from
granting access you didn't intend, we recommend that you create bespoke roles
that explicitly specify the logins that should be included in the certificates.

## Can Machine ID be used with per-session MFA?

We do not currently support Machine ID and per-session MFA. Enabling per-session
MFA globally, or for roles impersonated by Machine ID, will prevent credentials
produced by Machine ID from being used to connect to resources.

As a work-around, ensure that per-session MFA is enforced on individual roles
rather than enforced globally, and that it is not enforced for roles that you
will impersonate using Machine ID.
