title: Synchronization with Okta and SCIM
description: Managing Okta resources in Teleport
---

The Okta integration imports and synchronizes resources from an Okta
organization. This guide details how those Okta resources are represented inside
a Teleport cluster.

## Synchronization & SCIM

Teleport uses two complimentary methods for synchronizing Teleport resources with
an upstream Okta Organization:
 - the Okta integration synchronization process
 - provisioning via SCIM

On the whole, it doesn't matter to the wider Teleport system which method was
used to import a user as both processes create identical resources inside
Teleport.

To complement user provisioning, Okta is also able to model Okta permissions as
Access Lists, which will effectively import Okta's application permissions into
Teleport.

## Users

### Importing users

During synchronization, the Okta integration will create Teleport user accounts 
for all eligible Okta users, and clean up the Teleport accounts of any Okta users
that have been deactivated. The list of "eligible Okta users" depends on the
integration configuration. 

If the Okta integration is configured to use a specific Okta application, then
the Okta integration will consider any Okta user assigned to that Okta 
application - either directly, or via group membership - as an "eligible user". 

If no Okta application is to use is supplied, all enabled Okta organization
users are considered "eligible".

<Admonition type="note">
All hosted Okta integrations are configured to restrict their pool of users to
a specific Okta application.

The integration [enrolment process](./hosted-guide.mdx) creates an Okta SAML
Application to use as the identity provider for a new
[SAML Authentication Connector](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/sso/okta.mdx). The enrolment
process automatically configures the Okta integration to use this same
application, giving the Okta administrator a single point of integration to
administer and secure.

### Okta Profile to Teleport User

The Teleport users created by the synchronization process or SCIM provisioning
all inherit their username from the upstream Okta organization, and are given a
default role of `okta-requester`. 

This Role allows the user to log into Teleport, but grants no default access to
Teleport resources. The Teleport admin can use Access Requests and Access Lists
to grant access to Teleport resources as they see fit, once the user is
imported.

### Traits

All non-empty values in the Okta User/AppUser profile are converted to Teleport
user traits. For example, an imported Okta user might look like this:

```yaml
kind: user
metadata:
  name: hiro@enzos-pizza.com
  labels:
    okta/org: https://enzos-pizza.okta.com
    teleport.dev/origin: okta
roles:
  - okta-requester
spec:
  traits:
    okta/email:
      - hiro@enzos-pizza.com
    okta/firstName:
      - Hiro
    okta/lastName:
      - Protagonist
    okta/login:
      - hiro@enzos-pizza.com
```

Teleport administrators can then use these traits as conditions in Access Lists
in order to grant (or deny) the Okta-derived Teleport users access to Teleport
resources.

### Deleting Users

In the case where
 1. the synchronization process detects that an Okta user has been deactivated
    or suspended, or 
 1. the Okta organization explicitly disables the account via SCIM, 
 
The Okta integration will immediately delete the corresponding Teleport
account and create a temporary Teleport user lock. The user lock will 
 - terminate any active Teleport sessions, and
 - prevent the disabled user from accessing any Teleport resources with
   credentials issued before their Teleport account was deleted.

The user lock will expire after the maximum possible credential lifetime, plus
a small safety margin.

<Admonition type="warning">
Suspended Okta users will not be locked by Teleport.

When a user is suspended in Okta, Okta does not communicate the suspension to
Teleport and so Teleport will not automatically lock and remove that user.

Be sure to either deactivate the user, or unassign them from the Okta SAML
Application in order to make sure their status is updated in Teleport.

## Access Lists

### Modeling Okta permissions within Teleport

Okta has its own permissions system that doesn't map cleanly into Teleport. This
includes permissions granted by Okta groups along with the assignment of users to individual
applications within Okta. To model this within Teleport, an administrator would typically need
to carefully craft a labeling system to attach to various Okta apps and groups and a set of
roles to go along with them.

With the new Access List synchronization feature in the Okta service, this work is performed
for you. We'll discuss the details of how this works.

### Synchronizing Access Lists from Okta groups and applications

The Okta Access List synchronizer will look for any Okta group with members or any Okta
application with individual assignments that matches configurable filters that you can
optionally supply. Access lists will not be created for groups or applications without
any assignments.

The synchronizer will create the following resources for each matched group or application:

- A role for members that grants access to the group/application.
- A role for owners that grants the ability to review access to the group/application.
- An Access List representing membership to the group/application.
- Members for the Access List.

It should be noted that the Access List sync waits until the Okta groups and Okta applications
has finished syncing as Teleport resources, so it may not start synchronizing immediately on startup.

#### Deletion of Access Lists

Access Lists synchronized from Okta will automatically be deleted when there are no members assigned to them in
Okta or when they are deleted in Okta.

<Admonition type="warning">
It is possible for an administrator to delete Access Lists, but this should only be done once
the Okta integration has been removed and Access List synchronization is disabled. This could
remove all users from the Okta group or application that's being targeted!
</Admonition>

### Working with synchronized Access Lists

When first synchronizing an Access List, the owners of the Access List will be set to the default owners configured during the initial Okta integration enrollment, and the initial review date
will be set 6 months from the configured date. These fields are modifiable, as well as the owner and
membership requirements. However, you will not be able to change grants, as these belong to
the Okta Access List synchronizer.

The owners of an Okta synchronized Access List will be preserved between runs.

<Admonition type="warning">
Removing members from an Okta synchronized Access List will remove the user from the Okta group
or Okta application in Okta unless there are other assignments that convey the assignment to the
user. In this way, Teleport becomes the source of truth for Okta membership. Please keep this in mind
when adding other automated workflows or integrations into your Okta environment.
