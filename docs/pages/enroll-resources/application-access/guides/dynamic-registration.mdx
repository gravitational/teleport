Dynamic app registration allows Teleport administrators to register new apps (or
update/unregister existing ones) without having to update the static
configuration files read by Teleport Application Service instances. 

Application Service instances periodically query the Teleport Auth Service for
`app` resources, each of which includes the information that the Application
Service needs to proxy an application. 

Dynamic registration is useful for managing pools of Application Service
instances. And behind the scenes, the Teleport Discovery Service uses dynamic
registration to [register Kubernetes
applications](../../auto-discovery/kubernetes-applications/kubernetes-applications.mdx).

## Creating an app resource

Configure Teleport to proxy an application dynamically by creating an `app`
resource. The following example configures Teleport to proxy the application
called `example` at `localhost:4321`, making it available at the public address
`test.example.com`:

```yaml
kind: app
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
  description: "Example app"
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  uri: http://localhost:4321
  public_addr: test.example.com
```

See the full app resource spec [reference](../../../reference/agent-services/application-access.mdx).

The user creating the dynamic registration needs to have a role with access to the 
application labels and the `app` resource.  In this example role the user can only
create and maintain application services labeled `env: test`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: dynamicappregexample
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:      
      env: test
    rules:
    - resources:
      - app
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
version: v5
```

To create an application resource, run:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
$ tctl create app.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```code
# Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=myuser
$ tctl create app.yaml
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

After the resource has been created, it will appear among the list of available
apps (in `tsh apps ls` or UI) as long as at least one Application Service
instance picks it up according to its label selectors.

To update an existing application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create -f app.yaml
```

If the updated resource's labels no longer match a particular app agent, it
will unregister and stop proxying it.

To delete an application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl rm app/example
```
