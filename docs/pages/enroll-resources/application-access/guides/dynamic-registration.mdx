title: Dynamic App Registration
description: Register/unregister apps without restarting Teleport.
---

Dynamic app registration allows Teleport administrators to register new apps (or
update/unregister existing ones) without having to update the static
configuration files read by Teleport Application Service instances. 

Application Service instances periodically query the Teleport Auth Service for
`app` resources, each of which includes the information that the Application
Service needs to proxy an application. 

Dynamic registration is useful for [managing pools of Application Service
instances](../../agents/deploy-agents-terraform.mdx). And behind the scenes, the
Teleport Discovery Service uses dynamic registration to [register Kubernetes
applications](../../auto-discovery/kubernetes-applications.mdx).

## Required permissions

In order to interact with dynamically registered applications, a user must have
a Teleport role with permissions to manage `app` resources. 

In the following example, a role allows a user to perform all possible
operations against `app` resources:

```yaml
allow:
  rules:
    - resources:
        - app
      verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
```

## Enabling dynamic registration

To enable dynamic registration, include a `resources` section in your Application
Service configuration with a list of resource label selectors you'd like this
service to monitor for registering:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

You can use a wildcard selector to register all dynamic app resources in the cluster
on the Application Service or provide a specific set of labels for a subset:

```yaml
resources:
- labels:
    "env": "prod"
- labels:
    "env": "test"
```

## Creating an app resource

Configure Teleport to proxy an application dynamically by creating an `app`
resource. The following example configures Teleport to proxy the application
called `example` at `localhost:4321`, making it available at the public address
`test.example.com`:

```yaml
kind: app
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
  description: "Example app"
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  uri: http://localhost:4321
  public_addr: test.example.com
```

See the full app resource spec [reference](../reference.mdx#application-resource).

The user creating the dynamic registration needs to have a role with access to the 
application labels and the `app` resource.  In this example role the user can only
create and maintain application services labeled `env: test`.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: dynamicappregexample
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:      
      env: test
    rules:
    - resources:
      - app
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
version: v5
```

To create an application resource, run:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

```code
# Log in to your cluster with tsh so you can use tctl from your local machine.
# You can also run tctl on your Auth Service host without running "tsh login"
# first.
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --user=myuser
$ tctl create app.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">

```code
# Log in to your Teleport cluster so you can use tctl remotely.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh --user=myuser
$ tctl create app.yaml
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

After the resource has been created, it will appear among the list of available
apps (in `tsh apps ls` or UI) as long as at least one Application Service
instance picks it up according to its label selectors.

To update an existing application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create -f app.yaml
```

If the updated resource's labels no longer match a particular app agent, it
will unregister and stop proxying it.

To delete an application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl rm app/example
```
