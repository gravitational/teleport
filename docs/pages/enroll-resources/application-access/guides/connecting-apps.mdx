title: Web Application Access
description: In this getting started guide, learn how to connect an application to your Teleport cluster by running the Teleport Application Service.
---

This guide shows you how to enroll a web application with your Teleport cluster
in order to set up role-based access controls, audit logging, and other Teleport
capabilities.

## How it works

To enroll a web application with your Teleport cluster, you deploy the Teleport
Application Service, which uses a join token to establish trust with the
Teleport Auth Service. Users visit Teleport-protected web applications through
the Teleport Web UI. The Teleport Proxy Service routes browser traffic to the
Teleport Application Service, which forwards HTTP requests to and from target
applications. 

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A web application that you want to protect with Teleport. The web application
  should be running in a private network. In this guide, we assume that the web
  application is available on `app.example.com:3000`.
- A Linux server where you will run the Teleport Application Service. Your
  network must enable the server to connect to your web application.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Deploy the Teleport Application Service

In this step, you will configure the Teleport Application Service to proxy a
target application, then deploy a Teleport Agent to run the service.

### Generate a token

A join token is required to authorize a Teleport Application Service to
join the cluster. 

1. Generate a short-lived join token. Make sure to change `app-name` to the name
   of your application and `app-uri` to the application's domain name and port:

   ```code
   $ tctl tokens add \
       --type=app \
       --app-name=my-app \
       --app-uri=app.example.com:3000 \
       --ttl=1h
   ```

   This command creates a join token with a TTL of 1 hour.

1. Copy the token and save it in `/tmp/token` on the Linux server that will run
   the Teleport Application Service.

### Install the Teleport Application Service

Follow the instructions below on the host where you will install the Teleport
Application Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Configure the Teleport Application Service

1. On the host where you will run the Teleport Application Service, create a
   file at `/etc/teleport.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: v3
   teleport:
     join_params:
       token_name: "/tmp/token"
       method: token
     proxy_server: "teleport.example.com:443"
   auth_service:
     enabled: off
   proxy_service:
     enabled: off
   ssh_service:
     enabled: off
   app_service:
     enabled: true
     apps:
     - name: my-app
       uri: "app.example.com:3000"
       labels:
         env: "demo"
   ```

1. Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` to replace `teleport.example.com:443` with the host
   and port of your Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Enterprise (Cloud)
   account, e.g., `example.teleport.sh:443`.

1. Change `app.example.com:3000` to match the host and port of your own web
   application.

   The `app_service` field configures the Teleport Application Service. Each
   item within `app_service.apps` is an application configuration. The `labels`
   field assigns a label to each application. You can use Teleport labels to
   allow and deny users access to resources, as we will demonstrate later in
   this guide.

### Run the Teleport Application Service

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport Application Service"!)

## Step 2/3. [Optional] Configure TLS and DNS for your web applications

Once the Teleport Application Service is proxying traffic to your web
application, the Teleport Proxy Service makes the application available at the
following URL:

```text
https://<APPLICATION_NAME>.<TELEPORT_DOMAIN>
```

For example, if your Teleport domain name is `teleport.example.com`, the
application named `my-app` would be available at
`https://my-app.teleport.example.com`. The Proxy Service presents a TLS
certificate for this domain name that browsers can verify against a certificate
authority.

If you are using Teleport Enterprise (Cloud), DNS records and TLS certificates
for this domain name are provisioned automatically. If you are self-hosting
Teleport, you must configure these yourself:

1. Create either:
   - A DNS A record that associates a wildcard subdomain of your Teleport Proxy
     Service domain, e.g., `*.teleport.example.com`, with the IP address of the
     Teleport Proxy Service.
   - A DNS CNAME record that associates a wildcard subdomain of your Proxy
     Service domain, e.g., `*.teleport.example.com`, with the domain name of the
     Teleport Proxy Service.

1. Ensure that your system provisions TLS certificates for Teleport-registered
   applications. The method to use depends on how you originally set up TLS for
   your self-hosted Teleport deployment, and is outside the scope of this guide. 

   In general, the same system that provisions TLS certificates signed for the
   web address of the Proxy Service (e.g., `teleport.example.com`) must also
   provision certificates for the wildcard address used for applications (e.g.,
   `*.teleport.example.com`).

## Step 3/3. Configure RBAC and access the application

1. Create a role called `demo-app-access` that allows access to applications
   with the `env:demo` label that you assigned to the application that you
   enrolled earlier:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   version: v7
   metadata:
     name: demo-app-access
   spec:
     allow:
       app_labels:
         env: "demo"
   ```

1. Create a user called `appuser` with the `demo-app-access` role:

   ```code
   $ tctl users add --roles=demo-app-access appuser
   ```

   When `appuser` attempts to access the application you enrolled earlier
   through the Teleport Web UI, the the Teleport Proxy Service forwards the
   request with a Teleport-signed JSON web token to the Teleport Application
   Service. The Application Service checks the user's roles and, since the value
   of `allow.app_labels` matches one of the labels assigned to the application,
   the Application Service forwards the request to the application.

1. Sign in to the Teleport Web UI as `appuser`. You should see the option to
   visit the web application that you enrolled.

## Advanced options

### Application name

{/*
Note: this section of the docs is linked to from error messages in the product.
Please make sure to update lib/srv/servicecfg/app.go if you change this section
header or move this page.
*/}

An application name should make a valid sub-domain (\<=63 characters, no spaces, only `a-z 0-9 -` allowed).

After Teleport is running, users can access the app at `app-name.proxy_public_addr.com`
e.g. `grafana.teleport.example.com`. You can also override `public_addr` e.g
`grafana.acme.com` if you configure the appropriate DNS entry to point to the
Teleport proxy server.

### Running the dumper application

For testing and debugging purposes, we provide a built-in debug app called "dumper".
It can be turned on using `debug_app: true`.

```yaml
app_service:
   enabled: yes
   debug_app: true
```

The dumper app will dump all the request headers in the response.

### Customize public address

<Admonition
  type="note"
  title="For self-hosted environments only"
>
  The public address of apps cannot be changed or overridden on cloud-hosted Teleport tenants, due to TLS
  certificate limitations.

  For cloud-hosted customers, apps will always be available at `https://<app-name>.example.teleport.sh`, where `example`
  is the name chosen for your cloud-hosted Teleport tenant.
</Admonition>

By default applications are available at `<app-name>.<proxy-host>:<proxy-port>`
address. To override the public address, specify the `public_addr` field:

```yaml
- name: "jira"
  uri: "https://localhost:8001"
  public_addr: "jira.example.com"
```

### Skip TLS certificate verification

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Danger Zone"
>
  This is insecure and not recommended for use in production.
</Admonition>

Teleport checks if the certificates presented by the applications are signed
by a trusted Certificate Authority. When using self-signed certificates for
internal applications, use `insecure_skip_verify: true` to skip this
verification step:

```yaml
- name: "app"
  uri: "https://localhost:8443"
  public_addr: "app.example.com"
  insecure_skip_verify: true
```

### Deeplink to a subdirectory

Some applications are available in a subdirectory. Examples include the
[Kubernetes Dashboard.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/).
The URI should be updated to include the subdirectory:

```yaml
- name: "k8s"
  uri: "http://10.0.1.60:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/overview"
  public_addr: "k8s.example.com"
```

### Rewrite redirect

To support web apps that perform internal redirects, application access
provides an option to rewrite the hostname of the `Location` header on
redirect responses to the application's public address:

```yaml
- name: "jenkins"
  uri: "https://localhost:8001"
  public_addr: "jenkins.example.com"
  rewrite:
    # Rewrite the "Location" header on redirect responses replacing the
    # host with the public address of this application.
    redirect:
    - "localhost"
    - "jenkins.internal.dev"
```

### Headers passthrough

You can configure application access to inject additional headers in the
requests forwarded to a web application.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="teleport.yaml syntax">

For apps defined in the `teleport.yaml` configuration, the `headers` field of
each app is a list of strings. Be careful to quote the entire value to ensure it
is parsed correctly.

```yaml
- name: "dashboard"
  uri: https://localhost:4321
  public_addr: dashboard.example.com
  rewrite:
    headers:
    # Inject a static header.
    - "X-Custom-Header: example"
    # Inject headers with internal/external user traits.
    - "X-Internal-Trait: {{internal.logins}}"
    - "X-External-Trait: {{external.env}}"
    # Inject header with Teleport-signed JWT token.
    - "Authorization: Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
    # Override Host header.
    - "Host: dashboard.example.com"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dynamic registration syntax">

In a dynamic `app` resource, configure header rewrites with the
`spec.rewrite.headers` field. The value is a list of mappings that specify the
name and value of each header you would like to rewrite.

```yaml
kind: app
version: v3
metadata:
  name: "dashboard"
spec:
  uri: https://localhost:4321
  public_addr: dashboard.example.com
  rewrite:
    headers:
      # Inject a static header.
      - name: X-Custom-Header
        value: example
      # Inject headers with internal/external user traits.
      - name: X-Internal-Trait
        value: "{{internal.logins}}"
      - name: X-External-Trait
        value: "{{external.env}}"
      # Inject header with Teleport-signed JWT token.
      - name: Authorization
        value: "Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
      # Override Host header.
      - name: Host
        value: dashboard.example.com
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Headers injected this way override any headers with the same names that may
be sent by an application. The following headers are reserved and can't be
rewritten:

- `Teleport-Jwt-Assertion`
- `Cf-Access-Token`
- Any header matching the pattern `X-Teleport-*`
- Any header matching the pattern `X-Forwarded-*`

Rewritten header values support the same templating variables as
[role templates](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/guides/role-templates.mdx). In the
example above, `X-Internal-Trait` header will be populated with the value of
internal user trait `logins` and `X-External-Trait` header will get the value of
the user's external `env` trait coming from the identity provider.

Additionally, the `{{internal.jwt}}` template variable will be replaced with
a JWT token signed by Teleport that contains user identity information. See
[Integrating with JWTs](../jwt/introduction.mdx) for more details.

For full details on configuring Teleport roles, including how Teleport
populates the `external` and `internal` traits, see the [Teleport Access
Controls Reference](../../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).

### Configuring the JWT token

By default, Teleport includes a user's roles and traits in the JWT
generated for application access. If your application doesn't care
about these values, or you are encountering an error due to exceeding
the size limit of HTTP headers, you can configure Teleport to omit
this information from the token.

```yaml
- name: "dashboard"
  uri: https://localhost:4321
  public_addr: dashboard.example.com
  rewrite:
    # Specify whether to include roles or traits in the JWT.
    # Options:
    # - roles-and-traits: include both roles and traits
    # - roles: include only roles
    # - traits: include only traits
    # - none: exclude both roles and traits from the JWT token
    # Default: roles-and-traits
    jwt_claims: roles-and-traits
    headers:
    # Inject header with Teleport-signed JWT token.
    - "Authorization: Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
```

### Backends-for-Frontends support

By default, Teleport will only attempt to authenticate the user for the
requested app when launched from the Web UI. If this is a client application
that makes requests to a different backend application that is also protected by
Teleport, then the client application will not be able to make requests to that
backend application until a user has authenticated with both apps. In order to
remedy this, you can add the backend application name in the `required_apps`
field in the client app's spec which will then automatically attempt
authentication with each of the listed required apps when a user launches the
client application.

```yaml
- name: 'dashboard'
  uri: https://localhost:4321
  public_addr: dashboard.example.com
  # Optional list of Teleport application names that require a session for this app to function correctly.
  # When launching this app, any app listed here will also be launched, and a session will be created.
  # These sessions follow their respective RBAC policies.
  required_apps:
    - 'my-api'
    - 'prod-database'
    # Add more required app names as needed
```

### CORS support for preflight requests

Teleport does not send any unauthenticated requests to the destination app. This
means that any preflight requests sent by an application to another application
within Teleport for an API request will return an error and fail. You can
specify a CORS spec per application that will respond to these preflight
requests. This does not overwrite the destination app's CORS policy for the
requested route, but is only used for the OPTION requests sent to the requested
route.

```yaml
- name: 'dashboard'
  uri: https://localhost:4321
  public_addr: dashboard.example.com
  # Optional CORS policy is used for preflight requests only. It does not overwrite the contained
  # app's CORS policy per route but is used by Teleport to respond to unauthenticated OPTION requests.
  # Important Notes:
  # - Each field in the CORS spec is optional.
  # - The allowed_headers field accepts wildcard entries. However, in requests with "allow_credentials: true",
  #   a wildcard is treated as the literal header name "*" without special semantics.
  # - The Authorization header can't be set with a wildcard and always needs to be listed explicitly.
  cors:
    # Specifies which origins are allowed to make cross-origin requests.
    allowed_origins:
      - 'https://example.com'
      - 'https://app.example.com'
    # HTTP methods that are allowed when accessing the resource.
    allowed_methods:
      - 'GET'
      - 'POST'
      - 'PUT'
      - 'DELETE'
      - 'OPTIONS'
    # HTTP headers that can be used during the actual request.
    allowed_headers:
      - 'Content-Type'
      - 'Authorization'
      - 'X-Custom-Header'
    # Headers that browsers are allowed to access.
    exposed_headers:
      - 'Content-Type'
      - 'X-Custom-Response-Header'
    # Indicates whether the request can include credentials.
    allow_credentials: true
    # Indicates how long (in seconds) the results of a preflight request can be cached.
    max_age: 3600
```

## View applications in Teleport

Teleport provides a UI for quickly launching connected applications.

They can be viewed by navigating to a cluster's web UI and selecting the "Applications" tab.
The URL structure looks like this:

`https://[cluster-url:cluster-port]/web/cluster/[cluster-name]/apps`

## Logging out of applications

When you log into an application, you'll get a certificate and login session
per your defined RBAC. If you want to force log out before this period you can
do so by hitting the `/teleport-logout` endpoint:

- `https://internal-app.teleport.example.com/teleport-logout`
