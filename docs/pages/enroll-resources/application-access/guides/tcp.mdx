description: How to configure Teleport for accessing plain TCP apps
---

Teleport can provide access to any TCP-based application. This allows users to
connect to applications which Teleport doesn't natively support such as SMTP
servers or databases not yet natively supported by the Teleport Database
Service.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- TCP application to connect to. In this guide we'll use a PostgreSQL running
  in Docker as an example. You can also use any TCP-based application you may
  already have.
- Host where you will run the Teleport Application Service.

We will assume your Teleport cluster is accessible at `teleport.example.com`
and `*.teleport.example.com`. You can substitute the address of your Teleport
Proxy Service. (For Teleport Cloud customers, this will be similar to
`mytenant.teleport.sh`.)

## Step 1/4. Start PostgreSQL container

Skip this step if you already have an application you'd like to connect to.

Start a PostgreSQL server in a Docker container:

```code
$ docker run --name postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pass> -d postgres
```

## Step 2/4. Start Teleport Application Service

Teleport Application Service requires a valid auth token to join the cluster.

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">
To generate one, run the following command on your Auth Service node:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=app
```

Next, create a Teleport user with the `access` role that will allow it to
connect to cluster applications:

```code
$ tctl users add --roles=access alice
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Enterprise Cloud">
To generate one, log into your Cloud tenant and run the following command:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh
$ tctl tokens add --type=app
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Save the generated token in `/tmp/token` on the node where Application Service
will run.

Now, install Teleport on the Application Service node. It must be able to reach
both your Teleport Proxy and the TCP application it's going to proxy.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

Create the Application Service configuration file `/etc/teleport.yaml` with
the following contents:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  auth_token: "/tmp/token"
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:3080
auth_service:
  enabled: "no"
ssh_service:
  enabled: "no"
proxy_service:
  enabled: "no"
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  - name: "tcp-app"
    uri: tcp://localhost:5432
```

Note that the URI scheme must be `tcp://` in order for Teleport to recognize
this as a TCP application.

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

## Step 3/4. Start app proxy

Log into your Teleport cluster and view available applications:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com
$ tsh apps ls
Application Description   Type Public Address                   Labels
----------- ------------- ---- -------------------------------- -----------
tcp-app                   TCP  tcp-app.root.gravitational.io
```

Your TCP application should show up and be denoted with a `TCP` type.

Now log into the application:

```code
$ tsh apps login tcp-app
Logged into TCP app tcp-app. Start the local TCP proxy for it:

  tsh proxy app tcp-app

Then connect to the application through this proxy.
```

Next, start a local proxy for it:

```code
$ tsh proxy app tcp-app
Proxying connections to tcp-app on 127.0.0.1:55868
```

The `tsh proxy app` command will set up a listener that will proxy all connections to
the target application.

## Step 4/4. Connect

Once the local proxy is running, you can connect to the application using the
application client you would normally use to connect to it:

```code
$ psql postgres://postgres@localhost:55868/postgres
```

## Next steps

### Configuring access to multiple ports

By default, the Application Service proxies connections to the `uri` field from the application
specification. However, Teleport can enable access to multiple ports of a TCP application. An
application specification in this case needs to have no port number in the `uri` field and a new
field called `tcp_ports` with a list of ports.

For example, let's take tcp-app from the steps above and add access to port 8080 and port range
31276-32300. The Application Service definition should look like this:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  - name: "tcp-app"
    uri: tcp://localhost # No port in the URI
    tcp_ports:
    - port: 5432 # PostgreSQL
    - port: 8080 # HTTP server
    - port: 31276
      end_port: 32300 # Inclusive end of range
```

To access the app, [start VNet](../../../connect-your-client/vnet.mdx) and point an application
client towards the target port:

```code
$ curl -I http://tcp-app.teleport.example.com:8080
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

$ psql postgres://postgres@tcp-app.teleport.example.com:5432/postgres
```

<Notice type="warning">
There is no RBAC for TCP ports â€“ a user that has access to an application can connect to any port in
the specification. We&nbsp;strongly recommend specifying only the necessary ports instead of defining a
wide port range that happens to include ports that are meant to be available.
</Notice>

{/* TODO: DELETE IN 19.0.0. At this point all compatible servers and clients are going
to support multiple ports. */}

Support for multiple ports is available in Teleport v17.1+. Connections from Teleport clients that
do not support multiple ports are routed to the first port from the application specification. An
Application Service that does not support multiple ports will not be able to handle traffic to a
multi-port application if it receives such application through [dynamic
registration](./dynamic-registration.mdx) from an Auth Service.
