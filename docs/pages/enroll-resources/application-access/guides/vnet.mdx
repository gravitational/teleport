description: How to configure custom DNS zones for VNet
---

VNet automatically proxies connections made to TCP applications available under the public address
of a Proxy Service. This guide explains how to configure VNet to support apps with [custom public
addresses](connecting-apps.mdx#customize-public-address).

## How it works

Let's assume that a user has logged in to a cluster through a Proxy Service available at
`teleport.example.com`. There's a leaf cluster associated with that cluster. It has its own Proxy
Service available at `leaf.example.com`. Once started, VNet captures DNS queries for both of those
domains and their subdomains.

Type A and AAAA queries are matched against `public_addr` of applications registered in both
clusters. If there's a match and the application is registered as a TCP application, VNet responds
with a virtual IP address over which the connection will be proxied to the app. In any other
case, the query is forwarded to the default DNS name server used by the OS.

If you want VNet to forward connections to an app that has a custom `public_addr` set, you need
to first update the VNet config in the Auth Service to include a matching DNS zone.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx version="16.0.0"!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A TCP application connected to the cluster.
- A domain name under your control.

{/* vale messaging.protocol-products = NO */}
In this guide, we'll use the example app from [TCP Application Access guide](tcp.mdx) and make it
available through VNet at <Var name="public_addr" initial="tcp-app.company.test"/> with
<Var name="suffix" initial="company.test" /> as the custom DNS zone.
{/* vale messaging.protocol-products = YES */}

## Step 1/3. Configure custom DNS zone

Create a file called `vnet-config.yaml` which specifies the custom DNS zone. In our case the
`public_addr` of the app is going to be `tcp-app.company.test`, so we're going to set
`company.test` as `suffix`:

```yaml
kind: vnet_config
version: v1
metadata:
  name: vnet-config
spec:
  custom_dns_zones:
  - suffix: <Var name="suffix" />
```

Create the VNet config:

```code
$ tctl create vnet-config.yaml
vnet_config has been created
```

<Admonition type="note" title="Relationship between suffix and public_addr">
`suffix` doesn't have to point to a domain that's exactly one level above the `public_addr` of an
app. Any level of nesting works. For example, you can have an app under `tcp-app.foo.bar.qux.test`
and the suffix can be set to `bar.qux.test`.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/3. Set `public_addr` of the app

Set `public_addr` field of the application in the Application Service configuration file
`/etc/teleport.yaml` and restart the `teleport` daemon.

```yaml
version: v3
# …
app_service:
  # …
  apps:
  - name: "tcp-app"
    uri: tcp://localhost:5432
    public_addr: "<Var name="public_addr" />"
```

## Step 3/3. Connect

Once you [start VNet](../../../connect-your-client/vnet.mdx), you should be able to connect to the
application over the custom `public_addr` using the application client you would normally use to
connect to it. You might need to restart VNet if it was already running while you were making
changes to the cluster.

```code
$ psql postgres://postgres@tcp-app.company.test/postgres
```

## Next steps

### Configuring IPv4 CIDR range

Each cluster has a configurable IPv4 CIDR range which VNet uses when assigning IP addresses to
applications from that cluster. Root and leaf clusters can use different ranges. The default is
`100.64.0.0/10` and it can be changed by setting the `ipv4_cidr_range` field of the VNet config.

Create a file called `vnet-config.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: vnet_config
version: v1
metadata:
  name: vnet-config
spec:
  ipv4_cidr_range: "100.64.0.0/10"
```

Create the VNet config:

```code
$ tctl create vnet-config.yaml
vnet_config has been created
```

If the config already exists, you can use `tctl edit` instead:

```
$ tctl edit vnet_config
```

<Admonition type="note" title="IPv4 address of the TUN device">
When starting, VNet needs to assign an IPv4 address for its virtual network device. To pick an
address, [VNet arbitrarily chooses a root
cluster](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/43343) that the user is logged in to and
picks an address from the range used by that cluster. If your cluster uses a custom range, but your
users are logged in to other clusters that are not under your control, this might cause VNet to pick
an address for the TUN device from a range offered by one of those clusters.
</Admonition>

### Configuring leaf cluster apps

To make a [leaf cluster](../../../admin-guides/management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) app accessible over a custom
`public_addr`, you need to follow the same steps while being logged in directly to the leaf cluster.

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=leaf.example.com --user=email@example.com
```

### Accessing web apps through VNet

VNet does not officially support [web apps](connecting-apps.mdx) yet. However, technically any web
app is [a TCP app](tcp.mdx), so they can be made available over VNet as well. You'll need to change
`uri` of your application in the Application Service configuration file to use `tcp://` instead of
`http://`. There's also a couple of caveats:

- The Teleport Web UI uses [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security).
  If the application is going to be served from a subdomain of a Proxy Service, it means that the
  application will not be accessible in browsers over plain HTTP, even with VNet running. It's
  possible to work around this by setting a custom `public_addr` as explained above in this guide.
- If the application needs to be accessible over HTTPS, it must handle TLS connections and return [a valid
  cert](connecting-apps.mdx#step-23-optional-configure-tls-and-dns-for-your-web-applications) for the domain it is served on.
- [JWT Token](../jwt/introduction.mdx), [redirect](connecting-apps.mdx#rewrite-redirect) and
  [header rewrites](connecting-apps.mdx#headers-passthrough) are not available for TCP apps.
- Teleport records the start and the end of a session for TCP apps in the audit log, but [session
  chunks](../../../reference/architecture/session-recording.mdx) are not captured.

When accessing an HTTP API through VNet, the same caveats apply as above, with one main exception.
Since API clients don't need to respect HSTS, the API itself does not need to be served over HTTPS.

The important thing to understand is that VNet doesn't do anything extra with a connection, other
than passing it through a Teleport Proxy Service. Which application layer protocol is going to be
used depends solely on the app itself and its clients.
