description: How to configure Teleport application access in a Highly Available (HA) configuration.

You can deploy the Application Service in a Highly Available (HA) configuration
in a couple of common ways: combined instances and separate instances. Both of
those revolve around pointing multiple Application Services to the same
application.

## Combined instances

The most common approach is to assign the same `name` to each Application Service
proxying the application.

If you have two Application Services proxying the same application, configuration for
both agents would be identical:

```yaml
# Same config for both agents.
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  - name: "elastic"
    uri: https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200
```

With this configuration, you will see only a single entry for the application in
`tsh apps ls`:

```code
$ tsh apps ls
Application Description Type Public Address            Labels
----------- ----------- ---- ------------------------- -------------------
elastic                 HTTP elastic.proxy.example.com teleport.dev/origin
```

When connecting, Teleport will randomly pick the Application Service instance to
connect through to provide some load balancing. If the selected instance is down
(e.g. in case of AZ outage), Teleport will try to connect via other instances.

## Separate instances

With separate instances, each Application Service instance proxying the application
assigns it a different name. This allows you to explicitly pick the agent
you want to connect to the application over:

```yaml
# Application service instance #1.
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  # Note the name is different than instance #2 but the URI is the same.
  - name: "elastic-us-east-1a"
    uri: https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200
```

```yaml
# Application service instance #2.
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  # Note the name is different than instance #2 but the URI is the same.
  - name: "elastic-us-east-1b"
    uri: https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200
```

With this configuration, both services will appear as two separate entries in
`tsh apps ls` output and you will have to pick one explicitly when connecting:

```code
$ tsh apps ls
Application         Description Type Public Address            Labels
------------------- ----------- ---- ------------------------- -------------------
elastic-us-east-1a              HTTP elastic.proxy.example.com teleport.dev/origin
elastic-us-east-1b              HTTP elastic.proxy.example.com teleport.dev/origin
```

This approach is useful when you want to have control over which instance you
wish to connect to.
