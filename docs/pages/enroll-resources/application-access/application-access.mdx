Teleport provides secure access to applications and cloud provider APIs with RBAC, audit logging, and just-in-time access. 

The Teleport Application Service enables secure connections to private networks, supports Teleport JWTs for authentication, and provides guidance on app enrollment and access control configuration.

Note that it is also possible to secure applications with Teleport Identity
Governance by setting up Teleport as an IdP. See [Using the Teleport SAML
IdP](../../identity-governance/idps/usage/usage.mdx).
