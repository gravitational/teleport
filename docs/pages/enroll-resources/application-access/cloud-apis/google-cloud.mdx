title: "Protect Google Cloud API Access with Teleport"
description: How to enable secure access to Google Cloud APIs.
---

You can use Teleport to manage access to CLI tools that interact with Google
Cloud's APIs. This lets you control access to your infrastructure's management
APIs using the same RBAC system that you use to protect your infrastructure
itself.

The Teleport Application Service manages access to Google Cloud's APIs by
proxying requests from CLI applications. The Application Service authenticates
these requests using tokens retrieved from Google Cloud. This enables Teleport
operators to control the service accounts that users can assume in order to
interact with Google Cloud APIs.

{/* TODO: Add a mermaidjs graph here when available*/}

The Teleport Application Service connects to the Teleport Proxy Service over a
reverse tunnel, so you can run the Application Service in a private network and
prevent unauthorized access to your organization's Google Cloud service accounts.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A Google Cloud account with permissions to create IAM roles and service
  accounts, as well as create IAM role bindings for service accounts and
  projects.

- The `gcloud` CLI tool. Follow the [Google Cloud documentation
  page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk) to install and
  authenticate to `gcloud`.

  <Admonition type="tip">

  While this guide focuses on `gcloud`, once you set up Google Cloud API access
  with Teleport, you can also manage access to `gsutil` and other Google Cloud
  CLI tools using the Teleport Application Service.

  </Admonition>

- Either a Google Compute Engine VM where you will run the Teleport Application
  Service *or* permissions to create VMs in your Google Cloud project. If you
  are using a pre-existing VM, it must be running a Linux distribution, and you
  must have permissions to attach service accounts to Google Compute Engine VMs.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Using existing service accounts">

In this guide, we will demonstrate Google Cloud CLI access by creating a service
account for Teleport users to authenticate as, `teleport-vm-viewer`. If you would
like to enable access to any existing service accounts in your Google Cloud
project, you can replace `teleport-vm-viewer` with these as you work through the
guide.

</Admonition>

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Configure Google Cloud

The Teleport Application Service needs permissions from Google Cloud to proxy
requests from Teleport users to Google Cloud's APIs. In this step, you will
configure these permissions before you launch the Teleport Application Service.

When setting up Google Cloud API access with Teleport, you will configure
service accounts with two different functions:

- **Controlling service account:** The Application Service uses this service
  account to impersonate other service accounts and sign requests to Google
  Cloud APIs. In this guide, we will create a controlling service account called
  `teleport-google-cloud-cli`.
- **Target service accounts:** These are the service accounts you would like
  Teleport users in your organization to assume when accessing Google Cloud
  APIs. In this guide, we will create one target service account,
  `teleport-vm-viewer`, and you can follow the same steps to enable access to
  other target service accounts.

### Create a service account for the Application Service

The Application Service uses the controlling service account to access Google
Cloud APIs by generating signed tokens for target service accounts, which it
uses to sign requests from Teleport users before forwarding them to Google
Cloud. This way, local Google Cloud CLI tools have no access to these tokens.

In this section, we will create a controlling service account for the
Application Service and assign permissions to it.

Create a service account called `teleport-google-cloud-cli`:

```code
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create teleport-google-cloud-cli \
  --description="Google Cloud CLI access" \
  --display-name="teleport-google-cloud-cli"
```

### Set up a service account that Teleport users can access

When a Teleport user executes a Google Cloud CLI command against the Teleport
Application Service, the Application Service will use the
`teleport-google-cloud-cli` service account we created earlier to impersonate a
target service account.

In this section, we will show you how to grant the Application Service
permissions to impersonate target service accounts.

#### Create a service account and enable it to view resources

<Admonition type="tip">

If you are enabling access to an existing service account, you can skip to the
[next
section](#enable-teleport-google-cloud-cli-to-impersonate-target-service-accounts
).

</Admonition>

Create a target service account:

```code
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create teleport-vm-viewer \
  --description="Sample service account to demonstrate Teleport" \
  --display-name="teleport-vm-viewer"
```

Bind this service account to the predefined "Compute Viewer" role, which allows
users with the role to list Google Compute Engine resources:

```code
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <Var name="google-cloud-project" /> \
   --member="serviceAccount:teleport-vm-viewer@<Var name="google-cloud-project" />.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
   --role="roles/compute.viewer"
```

#### Enable `teleport-google-cloud-cli` to impersonate target service accounts

Enable the `teleport-google-cloud-cli` service account to impersonate
`teleport-vm-viewer` in order to authenticate user requests. To do so, bind the
`teleport-google-cloud-cli` account to the predefined "Service Account Token
Creator Role" for the `teleport-vm-viewer` service account:

<Admonition type="tip">

To enable Google Cloud CLI access for pre-existing service accounts, you must
run this command for each service account.

</Admonition>

```code
$ gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
 teleport-vm-viewer@<Var name="google-cloud-project" />.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
 --member=serviceAccount:teleport-google-cloud-cli@<Var name="google-cloud-project" />.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"
```

## Step 2/4. Deploy the Teleport Application Service

At this point, you have created a controlling service account and enabled this
service account to impersonate the service accounts you would like Teleport
users to access.

In this step, you will attach the controlling service account to a Google
Compute Engine VM, then run the Teleport Application Service.

### Enable the Application Service to access Google Cloud

Now that you have created a controlling service account and attached a role to
it, associate your service account with a virtual machine running the Teleport
Application Service. The instructions depend on whether you are using a
pre-existing virtual machine for the Teleport Application Service or launching a
new one:

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="New Virtual Machine">

Create a new virtual machine with the `teleport-google-cloud` service account
attached:

```code
$ gcloud compute instances create teleport-app-service \
   --service-account=teleport-google-cloud-cli@<Var name="google-cloud-project" />.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
   --scopes=cloud-platform \
   --zone=<Var name="google-cloud-zone" /> \
   --image=https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/debian-cloud/global/images/debian-11-bullseye-v20231212
```

You must use the `service-account` and `scopes` flags as we list them here,
otherwise the VM will fail to obtain the required authorization to access Google
Cloud. You should adjust the remaining flags and include new ones according to
the needs of your environment.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Existing Virtual Machine">

Stop your VM so you can attach your service account to it:

```code
$ gcloud compute instances stop <Var name="vm-name" /> --zone=<Var name="google-cloud-zone" />
```

Attach your service account to the instance:

```code
$ gcloud compute instances set-service-account <Var name="vm-name" /> \
   --service-account teleport-google-cloud-cli@<Var name="google-cloud-project" />.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
   --zone <Var name="google-cloud-zone" /> \
   --scopes=cloud-platform
```

<Admonition type="warning">

You must use the `scopes` flag in the `gcloud compute instances
set-service-account` command. Otherwise, your Google Cloud VM will fail to
obtain the required authorization to access Google Cloud.

</Admonition>

Once you have attached the service account, restart your VM:

```code
$ gcloud compute instances start <Var name="vm-name" /> --zone <Var name="google-cloud-zone" />
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

(!docs/pages/includes/application-access/app-service-join-token.mdx!)

### Install the Teleport Application Service

Follow the instructions below on the host where you will install the Teleport
Application Service.

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

### Configure the Teleport Application Service

On the host where you will run the Teleport Application Service, create a file
at `/etc/teleport.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "teleport.example.com:443"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
app_service:
  enabled: true
  apps:
  - name: google-cloud-cli
    cloud: GCP
```

Edit `/etc/teleport.yaml` to replace `teleport.example.com:443` with the host
and port of your Teleport Proxy Service or Teleport Cloud tenant, e.g.,
`mytenant.teleport.sh:443`.

The `app_service` field configures the Teleport Application Service. Each item
within `app_service.apps` is an application configuration.

In the example above, we have enabled Google Cloud CLI access by registering an
application called `google-cloud-cli` with the `cloud` field set to `GCP`. The
Teleport Application Service will forward requests to this application to Google
Cloud.

### Run the Teleport Application Service

On the host where you will run the Teleport Application Service, execute the
following command, depending on whether you installed Teleport using a package
manager or via a TAR archive:

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Teleport Application Service"!)

## Step 3/4. Enable your user to access Google Cloud CLIs

The next step is to authorize your Teleport user to access a target service
account and execute Google Cloud CLI commands via Teleport. You will protect
access to the service account using Teleport's RBAC system, where a user's roles
determine which Google Cloud service accounts (if any) they can access.

There are two approaches you can take to authorize users to access Google Cloud
service accounts:

|Approach|Description|Supported User Types|
|---|---|---|
|**Dynamic**|A Teleport role includes a template variable that grants a user access to all Google Cloud service accounts assigned directly to them.|Local users, OIDC, SAML|
|**Static**|A Teleport role explicitly specifies the Google Cloud service accounts a user is allowed to assume.|Local users, OIDC, SAML, GitHub|

<Admonition type="tip">

We recommend using the dynamic approach, since it scales more easily as you add
service accounts to your Google Cloud account. If you have configured an open
source Teleport cluster to authenticate users via GitHub SSO, you must use the
static approach, as OAuth-based GitHub applications do not support custom
claims.

</Admonition>

### Dynamic identities

If you are using dynamic identities, the approach you choose depends on whether
you use local or SSO Teleport users:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Local Users">

Create a file called `google-cloud-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: google-cloud-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    gcp_service_accounts:
      - '{{internal.gcp_service_accounts}}'
```

When a user with the `google-cloud-cli-access` role authenticates to a Google
Cloud CLI via Teleport, the Teleport Auth Service populates the
`{{internal.gcp_service_accounts}}` template variable with any Google Cloud
service accounts you have assigned to the user.

Assign the target service account we created earlier (or another service
account) to your Teleport user by running the following command, setting 
<Var name ="teleport-user" /> to the name of your Teleport user:

```code
$ tctl users update <Var name="teleport-user" /> \
--set-gcp-service-accounts teleport-vm-viewer@<Var name="google-cloud-project" />.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This command uses the `--set-gcp-service-accounts` flag to add Google Cloud
service accounts to a user. You can assign multiple service accounts to a user
by setting `--set-gcp-service-accounts` to a comma-separated list of service
account URIs.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f google-cloud-cli-access.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SAML/OIDC Connectors">

In your identity provider, define a custom SAML attribute or OIDC claim called
`gcp_service_accounts`. Each user's `gcp_service_accounts` attribute or claim
must be a list of Google Cloud service account URIs, using the following format:

```text
<service_account_name>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

For example, you can set a user's `gcp_service_accounts` to `teleport-vm-viewer`
by using the following URI, replacing `<project_id>` with the name of your Google
Cloud project:

```text
teleport-vm-viewer@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Create a file called `google-cloud-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: google-cloud-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    gcp_service_accounts:
      - '{{external.gcp_service_accounts}}'
```

When a user with the `google-cloud-cli-access` role authenticates to a Google
Cloud CLI via Teleport, the Teleport Auth Service populates the
`{{external.gcp_service_accounts}}` template variable with any Google Cloud
service accounts you have assigned to the user.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f google-cloud-cli-access
```

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Static identities

If you are using static identities, complete the following instructions.

Define a role with access to specific Google Cloud service accounts, which means
that Teleport users who assume this role can use those (and only those)
identities to execute commands via a Google Cloud CLI.

Create a file called `google-cloud-cli-access.yaml` with the following content,
replacing `my-project` with the ID of your Google Cloud project in the value of
`gcp_service_accounts`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: google-cloud-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    gcp_service_accounts:
      - teleport-vm-viewer@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

This role grants a user access to any Teleport-registered application, such as
the `google-cloud-cli` application we defined earlier, and allows that user to
assume the `teleport-vm-viewer` service account you created earlier.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f google-cloud-cli-access.yaml
```

<Details title="Denying access to Google Cloud service accounts">

You can define a Teleport role that denies a user access to one or more Google
Cloud service accounts. To do so, assign values to the `gcp_service_accounts`
field within the `spec.deny` section of a `role` resource.

For example, this role denies the user access to all Google Cloud service accounts:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: "no-google-cloud"
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
  deny:
    gcp_service_accounts:
      - '*'
```

The `no-google-cloud` role enables the user to access all registered
applications, but makes use of the wildcard character (`*`) within the
`deny.gcp_service_accounts` field to prevent the user from assuming any Google
Cloud service account.

Unlike values of `allow.gcp_service_accounts`, values of
`deny.gcp_service_accounts` can include wildcard expressions in addition to the
URIs of specific Google Cloud service accounts.

The Teleport Auth Service gives `deny` rules precedence over `allow` rules when
evaluating a user's roles.

</Details>

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="google-cloud-cli-access"!)

## Step 4/4. Use Google Cloud CLIs with Teleport

Now that you have started the Teleport Application Service and authorized your
Teleport user to access Google Cloud CLIs, you can run Google Cloud CLI commands
through Teleport.

### List your Google Cloud CLI application

Verify that your Teleport user can see the `google-cloud-cli` application you
registered earlier:

```code
$ tsh apps ls
Application      Description Type Public Address                        Labels
---------------- ----------- ---- ------------------------------------- -------------------
google-cloud-cli             HTTP google-cloud-cli.teleport.example.com teleport.dev/origin
```

### Log in to use a Google Cloud CLI

Log in to the application, specifying that you would like to assume the
`teleport-vm-viewer` service account:

```code
$ tsh apps login google-cloud-cli --gcp-service-account teleport-vm-viewer
```

This command validates the value of the `--gcp-service-account` flag against the
ones the user is authorized to assume. The value of the flag can either be the
full URI of the service account or the name of the identity, e.g.,
`teleport-vm-viewer`.

A user can omit the `--gcp-service-account` flag if they are only authorized to
access a single Google Cloud service account, but otherwise an empty
`--gcp-service-account` flag will result in an error.

If the command succeeds, you will see information about the user's chosen Google
Cloud service account similar to the following:

```text
Logged into GCP app "google-cloud-cli".
Your service account: teleport-vm-viewer@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
Example command: tsh gcloud compute instances list
```

### Execute Google Cloud CLI commands

At this point, you can run `gcloud` commands using the Teleport Application
Service by prefixing them with `tsh`. Since your user authenticated to your
Google Cloud CLI application with a service account that can list VMs, for
example, run this command to do so:

```code
$ tsh gcloud compute instances list
```

You should see a list of virtual machines in your Google Cloud project.

However, your Teleport user cannot create a VM, since its service account
does not have this authorization:

```code
$ tsh gcloud compute instances create another-instance --zone=<Var name="google-cloud-zone" />
ERROR: (gcloud.compute.instances.create) Could not fetch resource:
 - Required 'compute.instances.create' permission for 'projects/my-project/zones/my-zone/instances/another-instance'

ERROR: exit status 1
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Using gsutil with tsh">

You can also use the `google-cloud-cli` application you registered with Teleport
to run `gsutil` commands via the Teleport Application Service. As with `gcloud`,
prefix a `gsutil` command with `tsh` in order to run it:

```code
$ tsh gsutil ls
```

</Admonition>

### Use Google Cloud CLI applications without `tsh`

In addition to running `gcloud` and `gsutil` commands via `tsh`, you can grant
secure access to any CLI application that executes commands against Google
Cloud's APIs.

To do this, use `tsh` to start a local proxy that forwards traffic from your CLI
application to the Teleport Application Service. The Application Service uses
the `teleport-google-cloud-cli` service account we created earlier to fetch an
authentication token from Google Cloud. Your CLI application uses this token to
authenticate requests to Google Cloud's APIs.

To start the local proxy, run the following `tsh` command:

```code
$ tsh proxy gcloud
```

The command will print the address of the local proxy server along with
`export` commands for assigning environment variables. Google Cloud CLI
applications read these variables in order to request an authentication token
for Google Cloud's APIs:

```text
Started GCP proxy on http://127.0.0.1:50614.
To avoid port randomization, you can choose the listening port using the --port flag.

Use the following credentials and HTTPS proxy setting to connect to the proxy:

  export BOTO_CONFIG=/Users/myuser/.tsh/gcp/teleport.example.com/google-cloud-cli/00000000_boto.cfg
  export CLOUDSDK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=00000000000000000000000000000000
  export CLOUDSDK_CONFIG=/Users/myuser/.tsh/gcp/teleport.example.com/google-cloud-cli/gcloud
  export CLOUDSDK_CORE_CUSTOM_CA_CERTS_FILE=/Users/myuser/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/myuser-google-cloud-cli/teleport.example.com/google-cloud-cli-localca.pem
  export CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=my-project
  export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:50614
```

<Admonition type="warning">

`tsh proxy gcloud` runs the local proxy in the foreground, so don't interrupt
the process or exit the terminal where you ran the command until you're ready
to close the local proxy.

</Admonition>

Copy the `export` commands and paste them into a second terminal. In that
terminal, you can now run your Google Cloud CLI application of choice. For
example, you can run the following command to list Google Compute Engine VMs:

```code
$ gcloud compute instances list
```

Recall that you could run `gcloud iam service-accounts create` in a shell
earlier in this guide. After you enter the `export` commands printed by `tsh
proxy gcloud`, this command runs as a restricted user, resulting in
authorization issues:

```code
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create demo-service-account
ERROR: (gcloud.iam.service-accounts.create) User [myuser] does not have permission to access projects instance [myproject] (or it may not exist): Permission 'iam.serviceAccounts.create' denied on resource (or it may not exist).
- '@type': type.googleapis.com/google.rpc.ErrorInfo
  domain: iam.googleapis.com
  metadata:
    permission: iam.serviceAccounts.create
  reason: IAM_PERMISSION_DENIED
```

<Admonition type="info">

When you run a `gcloud` or `gsutil` command via `tsh gcloud` or `tsh gsutil`,
`tsh` starts the local proxy in the background and uses it to execute the
command.

</Admonition>

## Next steps

- Now that you know how to protect access to Google Cloud CLIs using Teleport,
  ensure that your Teleport users can only manage Google Cloud resources
  temporarily, with no longstanding admin roles for attackers to hijack. View
  our documentation on [Role Access
  Requests](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/access-requests/role-requests.mdx) and [Access
  Request plugins](../../../admin-guides/access-controls/access-request-plugins/access-request-plugins.mdx).
- You can proxy any `gcloud` or `gsutil` command via Teleport. For a full
  reference of commands, view the Google Cloud documentation for
  [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference) and
  [`gsutil`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil).
- For full details on how Teleport populates the `internal` and `external`
  traits we illustrated in the Teleport roles within this guide, see
  the [Access Controls
  Reference](../../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).
