## Inject JWT

(!docs/pages/includes/application-access/jwt-inject.mdx!)

For example:

```yaml
- name: "elasticsearch"
  uri: https://localhost:4321
  public_addr: elastic.example.com
  rewrite:
    headers:
    - "Authorization: Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
```

## Validate JWT

(!docs/pages/includes/application-access/jwt-validate.mdx!)

See the example Go program used to validate Teleport's JWT tokens on our
[GitHub](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/v(=teleport.version=)/examples/jwt/verify-jwt.go).

## Application guides

Many existing web applications and APIs support JWT authentication.

The following guides are currently available showing how to configure it:

- [ElasticSearch](./elasticsearch.mdx)
- [Grafana](./grafana.mdx)
