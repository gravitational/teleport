title: Using JWT authentication with Elasticsearch
description: How to use JWT authentication with Elasticsearch
---

This guide will help you configure Elasticsearch [JWT authentication](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/jwt-realm.html)
with Teleport.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- Running [Application Service](../guides/connecting-apps.mdx).
- Elasticsearch cluster version >= `8.2.0`.

## Step 1/3. Enable a JWT realm in Elasticsearch

Update your Elasticsearch configuration file, `elasticsearch.yaml`, to enable a
JWT realm:

```yaml
xpack.security.authc.realms.jwt.jwt1:
  order: 1
  client_authentication.type: none
  pkc_jwkset_path: https://proxy.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
  claims.principal: sub
  claims.groups: roles
  allowed_issuer: example-cluster
  allowed_audiences: ["https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200"]
```

Let's take a closer look at the parameters and their values:

- Set `client_authentication.type` to `none`, otherwise Elasticsearch requires
  clients to send a shared secret value with each request.
- Set `pkc_jwkset_path` to the JWT key set file URL of your Teleport Proxy. It
  is available at `https://<proxy>/.well-known/jwks.json` endpoint. You can
  also download the JSON file from the same URL and point the path directly to
  it instead of using a URL.
- Set `claims.principal` and `claims.groups` to `sub` and `roles` respectively.
  These are the claims Teleport uses to pass user and role information in JWT
  tokens. Keep in mind that **users and roles must exist** in Elasticsearch.
- Set `allowed_issuer` to the name of your Teleport cluster.
- Set `allowed_audiences` to the URL which Teleport Application Service will
  use to connect to Elasticsearch.

<Admonition title="Elasticsearch role mapping" type="note">
  Note that when using JWT authentication, you cannot map user roles using the
  standard Elasticsearch `role_mapping.yml` file. Instead, you need to set the
  role mapping using the API. See [JWT realm authorization](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/jwt-realm.html#jwt-authorization)
  for details.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/3. Register an Elasticsearch application in Teleport

In your Teleport App Service configuration file, `teleport.yaml`, register an
entry for Elasticsearch:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  apps:
  - name: "elastic"
    uri: https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200
    rewrite:
      headers:
      - "Authorization: Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  You can also use [dynamic registration](../guides/dynamic-registration.mdx).
</Admonition>

Elasticsearch requires a JWT token to be passed inside the `Authorization`
header. The header rewrite configuration above will replace the `{{internal.jwt}}`
template variable with a Teleport-signed JWT token in each request.

## Step 3/3. Connect to the ElasticSearch API

Log into your Teleport cluster with `tsh login` and make sure your Elasticsearch
application is available:

```code
$ tsh apps ls
Application Description   Public Address               Labels
----------- ------------- ---------------------------- -------------------------------
elastic                   elastic.teleport.example.com
```

Fetch a short-lived X.509 certificate for Elasticsearch:

```code
$ tsh apps login elastic
```

Then you can use the `curl` command to communicate with the Elasticsearch API,
which will authenticate you as your Teleport user:

```code
$ curl \
  --cacert ~/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/cas/root.pem \
  --cert ~/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice-app/example-cluster/elastic-x509.pem \
  --key ~/.tsh/keys/teleport.example.com/alice \
  https://elastic.teleport.example.com/_security/user | jq
```

## Next steps

- Get more information about integrating with [Teleport JWT tokens](./introduction.mdx).
- Learn more about [accessing APIs](../guides/api-access.mdx) with the Teleport
  Application Service.
- Take a look at application-related [Access Controls](../controls.mdx).
