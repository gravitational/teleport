description: How to deploy and use a Teleport Relay service

<Admonition type="warning">

This page refers to an unreleased Teleport feature and is thus subject to change. The following documentation applies to version `v18.0.2-dev.jsonpath.1-relay.2`.

</Admonition>

A Relay service group consists of one or more Teleport instances configured to run the Relay service with the same relay group name, all accessible behind the same load balancer. The Relay service uses two endpoints, one for "API" access (nominally, on port 3040) used by clients for the SSH transport and by agents for configuration discovery, and one for "tunnel" access (nominally, on port 3042) used by agents to run reverse tunnels. Both of those ports should be accessible through a load balancer that forwards connections to all the agents in the same Relay group.

The configuration for the Relay service is described as follows:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
  # ...
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: false
relay_service:
  enabled: true
  # a name assigned to the group, should be the same across instances
  # for the same group and should be unique in the cluster
  relay_group: groupname
  # how many tunnels to distinct Relays should be opened by the Teleport
  # instances pointed at this group
  target_connection_count: 2
  # optional duration value, how long the Relay should wait while broadcasting
  # its termination status before actually beginning its shutdown; should be set
  # to a value long enough for all agents pointed at the group to successfully
  # open new connections to new members of the group during rollouts
  shutdown_delay: '1m'
  # hostnames or IP addresses that the API endpoint is expected to be reached at
  # by clients and agents alike; normally it will just be one, but can be set to
  # multiple names in case the address should be changed, for seamless migrations
  api_public_hostnames:
    - relay-api-load-balancer.example.com
  api_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3040
  tunnel_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3042
  tunnel_public_addr: relay-api-load-balancer.example.com:3042
```

<Admonition type="warning">

The current version of the Relay service requires agents to be connected to each Relay in the group, so the `target_connection_count` should match the amount of replicas in the Relay deployment. This is a temporary limitation, and the final release of the feature will support bouncing connections between Relay instances, to support horizontal scaling of the Relay deployment.

<Admonition type="warning">

The current version of the Relay service requires agents to make use of a single Relay tunnel address behind a load balancer. Direct connections from agents to individual Relay instances is planned as an optional mode of operation.

</Admonition>

Teleport agents running the SSH service can be configured to use a Relay by specifying `teleport.relay_server` to point at the Relay API endpoint in their configuration file:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    # ...
  proxy_server: teleport.example.com:443
  relay_server: relay-api-load-balancer.example.com:3040
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: true
```

If `teleport.relay_server` is set, the agent will open reverse tunnels against the Relay in addition to its usual reverse tunnels against the Teleport control plane. Setting the `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_DISABLE_REVERSE_TUNNEL` envvar to `yes` will disable the standard reverse tunnels (during testing, it can be useful to confirm that the connections are using the Relay). The relay is only used if the agent is using "tunnel mode" (i.e. when the agent is pointed at a proxy rather than directly to an auth).

All Teleport SSH clients can make use of a relay by setting the `TELEPORT_UNSTABLE_RELAY_ADDR` envvar to point at the Relay API endpoint (the same value as `teleport.relay_server` for agents). The envvar should be set at connection time when using `tsh`, the `tsh` OpenSSH integration or a Machine ID `identity` output. The envvar must be set for the `tbot` process when using an `ssh-multiplexer` service. The final release of the Relay feature will include CLI options to set the desired Relay address at `tsh login` time and ways to enable and choose the Relay to use for each output and service in the `tbot` configuration file.

## Deploying a Relay with the `teleport-relay` chart

The `teleport-relay` chart (available in the `https://charts.releases.development.teleport.dev` Helm repository, or usable directly through the `https://charts.releases.development.teleport.dev/teleport-relay-18.0.2-dev.jsonpath.1-relay.2.tgz` URL) sets up a deployment with two replicas and a load balancer, using ports 3040 and 3042. Use of the chart requires setting some values:

```yaml
proxyAddr: teleport.example.com:443

# the `teleport.join_params` section of the Teleport config file, the join method should be
# valid for joining as a Relay; creating such a token currently requires using the `tctl` tool
# from the prerelease version
joinParams:
  method: iam
  token_name: tokenname

relayGroup: groupname
# targetConnectionCount: 2
# shutdownDelay: '0s'

apiPublicHostnames:
  - relay-api-load-balancer.example.com

tunnelPublicAddr: relay-api-load-balancer.example.com:3042

image:
  # required for the prerelease, will be automatic on final
  # release (except maybe for an "enterprise" flag)
  repository: 'public.ecr.aws/gravitational-staging/teleport-ent-distroless-debug'

# should account for the optional shutdown delay
#terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

Other options are described in [the chart's default `values.yaml`](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/v18.0.2-dev.jsonpath.1-relay.2/examples/chart/teleport-relay/values.yaml); options such as `serviceSpec` and `serviceAnnotations` can be quite useful to configure the properties of the load balancer, for example.

<Admonition type="warning">

The Relay service does not support in-place restarts or reusing the same host ID and the `teleport-relay` chart runs as a deployment and does not maintain any state (unlike the `teleport-kube-agent` chart), so the use of a secretless join method (`iam` through EKS Pod Identity, for example) is strongly recommended.
