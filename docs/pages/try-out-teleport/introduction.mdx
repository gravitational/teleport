While Teleport is designed to manage access to infrastructure with thousands of
virtual machines, Kubernetes pods, and managed services, you can get started
quickly with a demo environment. 

You can try out Teleport in browser-based labs, single-instance open source
Teleport deployments, or local, container-based Teleport clusters.

## Browser labs

Try out Teleport in your browser without setting up any infrastructure. Our
browser labs let you interact with an already running Teleport cluster so you
can get acquainted with Teleport's commands and capabilities:

[Check out our browser labs](./browser-labs.mdx).

## Demo deployments

You can set up a small-scale Teleport deployment that you can use to manage
access to your home lab or demo project. Once you have set up your demo
deployment, you can use it to add resources, set up RBAC, and enjoy secure
access to your infrastructure:

- [Try out Teleport on a Linux Server](./linux-server.mdx)
- [Use the 1-Click Digital Ocean Droplet for Teleport](./digitalocean.mdx)

## Local deployments

If you would like to try Teleport without setting up any infrastructure, but
would still like a real deployment that you can play with, check out our local
deployment labs:

- [Docker Compose Lab](./docker-compose.mdx)
- [Local Kubernetes Lab](./local-kubernetes.mdx)
