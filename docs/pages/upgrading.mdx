The guides in this section show you how to upgrade Teleport to a more recent
version.

Read the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./upgrading/overview.mdx) to
understand how to upgrade components in your Teleport cluster while ensuring
compatibility between all components.

If you have a Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) account, you **must** [set up automatic
Teleport agent updates](./upgrading/automatic-agent-updates.mdx) to ensure that
the version of Teleport running on agents is always compatible with that of the
Teleport cluster. You can also set up automatic agent upgrades in a self-hosted
cluster.

For more information about upgrading, for example, to upgrade manually, read the
[Upgrading Reference](./upgrading/reference.mdx).

You can find more information regarding the automatic updates architecture in the
[Agent Update Management](./architecture/agent-update-management.mdx) page.
