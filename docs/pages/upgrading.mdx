The guides in this section show you how to upgrade Teleport to a more recent
version.

## Upgrading compatibility overview

Since Teleport is a distributed system with a number of services that run on
potentially many hosts, you should take care when upgrading the cluster to
ensure that all components remain compatible.

The [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./upgrading/overview.mdx) explains how to
upgrade components in your Teleport cluster to ensure that they communicate as
expected.

## Upgrading guides

After getting familiar with the Compatibility Overview, read one of the
following guides to upgrade the components in your Teleport cluster. Choose the
guide that matches your Teleport edition and the platform where you run Teleport
services:

Teleport Cloud:

- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/cloud-linux.mdx)
- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/cloud-kubernetes.mdx)

Self-hosted deployments:

- [Linux Servers](./upgrading/self-hosted-linux.mdx)
- [Kubernetes](./upgrading/self-hosted-kubernetes.mdx)

## Automatic agent upgrades

We recommend that Teleport users set up automatic agent upgrades, where agents
query a **version server** in order to determine whether they are out of date
and need to install a new version of Teleport. 

On Teleport Cloud, the version server is managed for you.

If you are running Teleport Enterprise, read the [Self-Hosted Automatic Agent
Updates](./upgrading/self-hosted-automatic-agent-updates.mdx) guide to set up
the version server yourself.
