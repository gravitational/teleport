title: "Self-Hosting Identity Activity Center"
description: Explains how to enable Identity Activity Center.
---

In this guide, you will set up the infrastructure required
to enable the Identity Activity Center in Teleport's Identity Security product.
Identity Activity Center allows you to centralize audit logs and access paths from various sources
for enhanced visibility and management.

(!docs/pages/includes/policy/identity-activity-center.mdx!)

Identity Activity Center is a feature of [Teleport Identity Security](https://goteleport.com/platform/identity-security/)
product that is only available to Teleport Enterprise customers.

## How it works

Teleport Identity Security uses an AWS SQS queue to publish and consume audit logs.
When deployed in high-availability mode, Teleport Identity Security elects a leader
that's responsible for consuming messages from the queue, converting and enhancing
them with metadata such as location, and writing them as Parquet files in the
long-term S3 bucket.

Amazon Athena powers a query engine in the Identity Activity Center. To specify
the schema and retrieve data from Parquet files kept in the long-term S3 bucket,
Amazon Athena makes use of an AWS Glue Table. With this configuration, audit
logs can be efficiently queried and analyzed, leading to improved insights and
simplified data management for identity security.

## Prerequisites
- A running Teleport Enterprise cluster v18.0.0 or later.
- An updated Teleport Enterprise license file with Teleport Identity Security enabled.
- A PostgreSQL database server v14 or later.
  - Access Graph needs a dedicated [database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdatabase.html) to store its data.
    The user that Teleport connects to the database with needs to be the owner of this database, or have similar broad permissions:
    at least the `CREATE TABLE` privilege on the `public` schema, and the `CREATE SCHEMA` privilege.
  - Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL is supported.
- A TLS certificate for the Access Graph service
- A running Access Graph node v1.28.0 or later.
  Check the [Identity Security page](../teleport-policy.mdx) for details on
  how to set up Access Graph.


<Admonition type="note">

The Identity Activity Center is currently supported only for self-hosted clusters.
Teleport Enterprise Cloud support is planned for release later this year.

## Step 1/4. Infrastructure setup

You can set up the required infrastructure to support the Identity Activity Center with the
following Terraform script.

<details>
<summary>Terraform script</summary>

Below is a list of the required variables along with their descriptions,
which are necessary for the Terraform script to execute.

- <Var name="eu-central-1"/> is the name of the region where infrastructure should be created.
- <Var name="example-sqs-queue"/> is the name of the AWS SQS queue.
- <Var name="example-sqs-dlq"/> is the name of the AWS SQS dead-letter queue.
- <Var name="example-kms-key"/> is the name of the AWS KMS encryption key used to encrypt S3 bucket files and SQS messages.
- <Var name="example-long-term-bucket"/> is the long-term S3 bucket used to store the events.
- <Var name="example-transient-bucket"/> is the transient S3 bucket used to store temporary files such as query results and large files.
- <Var name="example-db"/> is the name of the AWS Glue database.
- <Var name="example-table"/> is the name of the AWS Glue table.
- <Var name="example-workgroup"/> is the name of the Amazon Athena Workgroup.
- <Var name="aws-account-id"/> is the AWS account id.

Define the variables using the script below or configure them in your
Teleport IaC script.

```bash
cat > variables.auto.tfvars << EOF
aws_region                = "<Var name="eu-central-1"/>"
iac_sqs_queue_name        = "<Var name="example-sqs-queue"/>"
iac_sqs_dlq_name          = "<Var name="example-sqs-dlq"/>"
iac_kms_key_alias         = "<Var name="example-kms-key"/>"
iac_long_term_bucket_name = "<Var name="example-long-term-bucket"/>"
iac_transient_bucket_name = "<Var name="example-transient-bucket"/>"
iac_database_name         = "<Var name="example-db"/>"
iac_table_name            = "<Var name="example-table"/>"
iac_workgroup             = "<Var name="example-workgroup"/>"
EOF
```

Execute the following Terraform script to create the required infrastructure.

### `variables.tf`

`variables.tf` file includes the description of the required Terraform variables.

```terraform
(!examples/identity-activity-center/variables.tf!)
```

### `identity_activity_center.tf`

`identity_activity_center.tf` file includes the declaration of every resource
that Terraform will create and manage. This includes AWS KMS keys, AWS S3 Buckets
for transient and long-term storage, and AWS Glue table and database.

```
(!examples/identity-activity-center/identity_activity_center.tf!)
```

### `policy.tf`

`policy.tf` includes the declaration of the AWS IAM policy that must
be attached to the AWS identity that the Identity Security service runs as,
enabling it to access the resources and execute queries.

```
(!examples/identity-activity-center/policy.tf!)
```

The Terraform script will output two variables:

- `identity_activity_center_iam_policy`: AWS IAM policy required for Identity Security to connect to AWS resources. Attach the policy to the Identity Security AWS IAM role.
- `identity_activity_center_yaml`: YAML configuration to append to the Identity Security configuration or Helm chart values.

## Step 2/4. Configure MaxMind GeoIP City database (optional)

<Admonition type="note">

MaxMind GeoIP database configuration is optional, but we do recommend it for geolocation tracking.

</Admonition>


To enrich audit events with GeoIP details such as country, city, region, latitude,
and longitude based on IP addresses, we strongly recommend using the
[MaxMind GeoIP City database](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-databases).

MaxMind provides both free and paid versions of its GeoIP City database.
The free version is less accurate and updated less frequently compared to
the paid version. You can find instructions for downloading the free
version or purchasing the paid version on the
[MaxMind Developer website](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data/).

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster" >

To configure enhanced location details for self-hosted clusters, upload the database file to the machine where
Identity Security runs. You will specify its location in the config file below.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster using Helm Chart">

To configure enhanced location details for self-hosted clusters installed using the Helm Chart, first create
the secret that contains the IP database:

```bash
$ kubectl create secret generic maxmind-geoip-city-db --from-file=GeoLite2-City.mmdb

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 3/4. Modify Identity Security configuration

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster" >

To configure it for self-hosted clusters, update the Identity Security configuration and
append the following section:

```yaml

identity_activity_center:
  region: <Var name="eu-central-1"/>
  database: <Var name="example-db"/>
  table: <Var name="example-table"/>
  s3: s3://<Var name="example-long-term-bucket"/>/data/
  s3_results: s3://<Var name="example-transient-bucket"/>/results/
  s3_large_files: s3://<Var name="example-transient-bucket"/>/large_files
  sqs_queue_url: https://sqs.<Var name="eu-central-1"/>.amazonaws.com/<Var name="aws-account-id"/>/<Var name="example-sqs-queue"/>
  maxmind_geoip_city_db_path: /path/to/geoIp-city.mmdb # optional

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster using Helm Chart">

To configure it for self-hosted clusters installed using the Helm Chart, update your
Helm chart values with the following details:

```yaml

# optional
 volumes:
 - name: maxmind-geoip-city-db
   secret:
     secretName: maxmind-geoip-city-db
     optional: false

# optional
 volumeMounts:
 - name: maxmind-geoip-city-db
   mountPath: "/etc/maxmindGeoIP/"
   readOnly: true

identity_activity_center:
  enabled: true
  region: <Var name="eu-central-1"/>
  database: <Var name="example-db"/>
  table: <Var name="example-table"/>
  s3: s3://<Var name="example-long-term-bucket"/>/data/
  s3_results: s3://<Var name="example-transient-bucket"/>/results/
  s3_large_files: s3://<Var name="example-transient-bucket"/>/large_files
  sqs_queue_url: https://sqs.<Var name="eu-central-1"/>.amazonaws.com/<Var name="aws-account-id"/>/<Var name="example-sqs-queue"/>
  maxmind_geoip_city_db_path: "/etc/maxmindGeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb" # optional
```

Run `helm upgrade` to re-deploy Identity Security.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Step 4/4. Restart Identity Security

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster" >

The final step is to restart the Identity Security docker process or restart the process
so it can reload the latest configuration.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster using Helm Chart">

The final step is to wait for the Identity Security Deployment to complete the rollout
of the new replicas.
