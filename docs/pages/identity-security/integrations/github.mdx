This guide walks you through configuring Identity Security to import
GitHub Audit Logs, providing enhanced visibility and alerts for suspicious activities.

(!docs/pages/includes/policy/identity-activity-center.mdx!)

Identity Activity Center is a feature of [Teleport Identity Security](https://goteleport.com/platform/identity-security/)
product that is only available to Teleport Enterprise customers.

## How it works

Identity Activity Center retrieves GitHub Audit Logs through
a polling mechanism that executes every minute, standardizing,
analyzing, and storing them for long-term retention.

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport Enterprise cluster v18.0.0 or later.
- Identity Security enabled for your account.
- For self-hosted clusters:
  - Ensure that an up-to-date `license.pem` is used in the Auth Service configuration.
  - A running Access Graph node v1.28.0 or later with Identity Activity Center enabled.
Check the [Identity Security page](../teleport-policy.mdx) for details on
how to set up Access Graph and enable Identity Activity Center.
- GitHub admin access to an organization.

## Step 1/2. Create a GitHub application

Identity Activity Center accesses your GitHub organization through a GitHub application.

Throughout this guide, you will create a GitHub application, configure the required permissions,
generate a Private Key, and finally install it into your organization.

First, navigate to your GitHub organization page and select **Settings**. On the left menu,
expand **Developer settings** and select **GitHub Apps**. In the top-right corner, select
**New GitHub App**.

Fill in the application name, deactivate **Webhook**, and select the requested permissions:


* Repository permissions
  - Metadata: Read-only
* Organization permissions
  - Administration: Read-only
  - Custom organization roles: Read-only
  - Custom repository roles: Read-only
  - Members: Read-only
  - Personal access token requests: Read-only
  - Personal access tokens: Read-only

Once selected, click the **Create GitHub App** button. Navigate to the newly created App settings
and click the **Generate Private Key** button. Clicking this button will trigger a private key
file download. Save the file for later. Also copy the **Client ID** displayed in
the App's **About** section.

To restrict access to specific IPs, you can configure the **IP allow list** section
to allow access only from the Teleport Auth Service’s IP addresses.

Finally, select **Install App** and install the application into the desired organization.


## Step 2/2. Set up Audit Log and Access Path Sync

To initiate the setup wizard for configuring GitHub sync, access the Teleport UI,
click the Identity Security sidebar button, and then click **Integrations**.

Click the **Setup new integration** button, and then select **GitHub**. You'll be prompted
to create a new Identity Activity Center GitHub integration. During the setup process, you
will be asked to provide:

- Organization name
- Private Key downloaded in the previous step
- Client ID copied in the previous step

Once you complete all the steps, the **Investigations** tab in Identity Security will begin displaying
GitHub Audit Logs and Access Paths after a few minutes.
