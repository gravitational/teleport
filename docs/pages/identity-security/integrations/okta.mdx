Understand access patterns within your Okta organization using Teleport Identity Security. 
By scanning users, groups, applications, roles, role assignments, and API tokens, Teleport provides a visual
representation to help you understand and strengthen the permission model within your Okta environment.
Additionally, Teleport Identity Security streams Okta system logs via [Identity Activity Center](../access-graph/identity-activity-center.mdx)
for audit and investigation. This functionality enables you to answer queries such as:

- Which applications can a specific user access?
- Who has administrator roles in the Okta organization?
- Which API tokens exist and who owns them?
- What admin actions have been performed recently?
- Is my upstream IDP being comprised, and are there any suspicious login patterns?

(!docs/pages/includes/policy/access-graph.mdx!)

## How it works

Access Graph synchronizes Okta resources with Teleport resources, and visualizes their relationships using
the graph representation detailed in the [Identity Security usage page](../usage/usage.mdx). Teleport Identity
Activity Center captures Okta system logs, allowing you to investigate user activities and administrative actions
within your Okta organization.

The importing process involves three components:

### Polling Okta APIs

Access Graph and Identity Activity Center periodically scan the configured Okta organization and retrieve the following resources:

- Users
- Groups
- Applications
- Roles
- Role assignments
- API tokens

The default polling interval is 30 minutes (configurable). Once all resources are fetched,
Teleport pushes them to the Access Graph, ensuring it remains updated with the latest
information from your Okta organization.

### Importing resources

Access Graph maps the relationships between imported resources, including:

- User-to-group memberships
- User-to-application assignments
- Role assignments linking users to administrator and custom roles

These relationships are rendered as a navigable graph, allowing you to trace access paths
from any identity to the resources it can reach.

### Streaming Okta Audit Logs

Identity Activity Center polls the Okta System Log API on a minute-by-minute basis, retrieving
audit events. 

Event types captured include:

- Authentication events (sign-ins, MFA challenges, session starts)
- Administrative actions (user lifecycle changes, role assignments, policy modifications)
- Application access events
- Security events (suspicious activity, locked accounts, password resets)

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport Enterprise cluster v16.0.0 or later.
- Identity Security enabled for your account.
- An Okta organization with one of the following:
  - An API token (SSWS) with read access to users, groups, applications, roles, and system logs.
  - An OAuth 2.0 application with the required scopes (see Step 1).
- For self-hosted clusters:
  - Ensure that an up-to-date `license.pem` is used in the Auth Service configuration.
  - A running Access Graph node v1.24.0 or later.
    Check the [Identity Security page](../identity-security.mdx) for details on
    how to set up Access Graph.
  - The node running the Access Graph service must be reachable from the Teleport Auth Service.

<Admonition type="tip">
If you already have an Okta integration configured through
[Identity Governance](../../identity-governance/integrations/okta/okta.mdx),
you can enable Identity Security features on the existing integration without
creating a new one. See Step 2 for details.
</Admonition>

## Step 1/4. Configure Okta API credentials

Teleport supports two authentication methods for connecting to the Okta API. 
Either a SSWS bearer token or OAuth 2.0 client credentials can be used.

### Option A: SSWS bearer token

1. In the Okta Admin Console, navigate to **Security** > **API** > **Tokens**.
2. Click **Create Token** and give it a descriptive name (e.g., `Teleport Identity Security`).
3. Copy the generated token value. You will need it in Step 2.

<Admonition type="warning">
The token inherits the permissions of the administrator who creates it.
Ensure the administrator account has read access to users, groups, applications,
roles, and system logs. Use a service account with the **Read-Only Administrator**
role or a custom admin role with equivalent read permissions.
</Admonition>

### Option B: OAuth 2.0 client credentials

1. In the Okta Admin Console, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications**.
2. Click **Create App Integration** and select **API Services**.
3. Assign the application the required OAuth scopes:
   - `okta.users.read`
   - `okta.groups.read`
   - `okta.apps.read`
   - `okta.roles.read`
   - `okta.logs.read`
4. Note the **Client ID**. You will need it in Step 2.

## Step 2/4. Set up the Okta integration

In this step we'll set up the integration in Teleport. Teleport has a 
comprehensive Okta integration and as part of this onboarding wizard, teams 
can choose to enable Identity Security features.

### New integration

To create a new Okta integration with Identity Security:

1. In the Teleport Web UI, click the **Identity Security** sidebar button, then click **Integrations**.
2. Click **Setup new integration** and select **Okta**.
3. Follow the setup wizard:
   - Enter your Okta organization URL (e.g., `https://your-org.okta.com`).
   - Provide the API credentials configured in Step 1 (SSWS token or OAuth Client ID).
   - Enable the Identity Security features you want: resource scanning and/or system log export.
4. Once credentials are validated, the integration begins syncing resources.

### Existing integration

If you already have an Okta integration configured through Identity Governance:

1. Navigate to the Okta integration status page (**Identity Governance** > **Integrations** > click the Okta row).
2. Enable the Identity Security options (resource scanning and system log export) from the status page.

For full details on SSO, SCIM, user sync, and application/group sync setup, see the
[Identity Governance Okta integration guide](../../identity-governance/integrations/okta/okta.mdx).

## Step 3/4. View Okta resources in Access Graph

After the initial sync completes, Okta resources appear as nodes in the Access Graph.
You can explore them by navigating to **Identity Security** > **Browse** in the Teleport Web UI.

### Browsing the graph

Use the search bar at the top of the graph to find a specific Okta group, user, or application
by name. Click on any node to open a side panel showing its details:

- **Okta Group nodes** show the group's members, owners, and audit schedule. Select the
  **Permissions & Eligibility** tab to see which Teleport roles the group grants.
- **Okta User nodes** show the user's group memberships and application assignments. Click
  **View Access** to trace the full access path from the user through groups and roles to
  the resources they can reach.
- **Browse Connections** expands the graph around a selected node to reveal related
  identities and resources.

### SQL queries

You can run SQL queries in the Graph Explorer query bar to fetch specific information.
Okta resources are tagged with `teleport.dev/origin: okta`, which you can use to filter results.

In the following queries, replace the placeholder values with your own:

| Placeholder | Description |
|---|---|
| <Var name="your-org" /> | Your Okta organization subdomain (e.g., `acme` for `acme.okta.com`) |
| <Var name="user" /> | The Okta username to look up |
| <Var name="app-name" /> | The name of the Okta application |
| <Var name="group-name" /> | The name of the Okta group |

#### Show all Okta resources

```sql
SELECT * FROM nodes WHERE labels @> '{"teleport.dev/origin": "okta"}';
```

#### Show all Okta resources for a specific org

```sql
SELECT * FROM nodes WHERE labels @> '{"okta/org": "https://<Var name="your-org" />.okta.com"}';
```

#### Fetch all access paths for an Okta user

```sql
SELECT * FROM access_path WHERE identity = '<Var name="user" />' AND kind = 'ALLOWED';
```

#### Fetch all users who can access an Okta application

```sql
SELECT * FROM access_path WHERE resource = '<Var name="app-name" />' AND resource_labels @> '{"teleport.dev/origin": "okta"}';
```

#### Fetch all members of an Okta group

```sql
SELECT * FROM access_path WHERE resource = '<Var name="group-name" />' AND resource_labels @> '{"teleport.dev/origin": "okta"}';
```

#### Find Okta users with standing privileges

```sql
SELECT * FROM access_path WHERE standing_privileges >= 1 AND resource_labels @> '{"teleport.dev/origin": "okta"}';
```

## Step 4/4. View Okta activity in Identity Activity Center

After enabling system log export, Okta audit events appear in the
[Identity Activity Center](../usage/investigate.mdx).
Navigate to **Identity Security** > **Activity Center** in the Teleport Web UI to search
and investigate Okta system log events alongside activity from other connected platforms.

The Identity Activity Center normalizes Okta system logs alongside audit data from AWS,
GitHub, and Teleport, giving you a single view of identity activity across your organization.
Use the Investigate view to explore related events and trace activity across platforms for 
a specific identity.

## Alerts

Teleport Identity Security includes pre-built
[security detections](../usage/alerts.mdx) that automatically create alerts for
suspicious Okta activity. These detections monitor Okta system log events and
trigger alerts without any additional configuration.

## Troubleshooting

After setting up the Okta integration, you can monitor the sync status on the Identity Security
Integrations page. If the import fails, an error message will help identify the issue.

### Authentication errors

If you see `Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` errors:

- **SSWS token**: Verify the token has not expired and the creating administrator has
  sufficient permissions. Create a new token if needed and update the integration settings.
- **OAuth app**: Verify the Client ID is correct and the required scopes are assigned to
  the application.

### System log export issues

If system log events are not appearing in the Identity Activity Center:

- Ensure the **system log export** toggle is enabled on the integration.
- Verify the API credentials have read access to system logs (`okta.logs.read` scope
  or equivalent admin permissions).
- Check that your Okta organization has the System Log API enabled.

### Connectivity issues

Ensure the Teleport cluster can reach your Okta organization URL over HTTPS. For self-hosted
clusters, verify that network policies and firewalls allow outbound connections to `*.okta.com`
or your custom Okta domain.

### General troubleshooting

Inspect the error log on the Identity Security Integrations page for detailed error messages.
If issues persist, check the Teleport Auth Service logs for additional context.
