title: Discover AWS Access Patterns and AWS CloudTrail events with Teleport Identity Security
description: Describes how to import and visualize AWS accounts access patterns using Identity Security and Access Graph.
---

Identity Security streamlines and centralizes access management across your entire infrastructure. You can view access relationships in seconds,
viewing unified, up-to-date relationships and policies between all users, groups, and computing resources.

Identity Security with Access Graph offers insights into access patterns within your AWS account. By scanning IAM
permissions, users, groups, resources, and identities, it provides a visual representation and aids in
enhancing the permission model within your AWS environment. This functionality enables you to address queries such as:

- What resources are accessible to AWS users and roles?
- Which resources can be reached via identities associated with EC2 instances?
- What AWS resources can Teleport users access when connecting to EC2 nodes?

Identity Security also offers CloudTrail data ingestion, analysis for threats and correlation with
other services such as Okta and GitHub Actions.

Utilizing the Access Graph to analyze IAM permissions within an AWS account necessitates the setup of the Access Graph
service, a Discovery Service, and integration with your AWS account.

(!docs/pages/includes/policy/access-graph.mdx!)

## How it works

Access Graph discovers AWS access patterns, synchronizes various AWS resources,
including IAM Policies, Groups, Users, User Groups, EC2 instances, EKS clusters, and RDS databases.
These resources are then visualized using the graph representation detailed in the
[Identity Security usage page](../policy-how-to-use.mdx).

The importing process involves three primary steps:

### Polling Cloud APIs

The Teleport Discovery Service continuously scans the configured AWS accounts.
At intervals of 15 minutes, it retrieves the following resources from your AWS account:

- Users
- Groups
- User Groups
- IAM Roles
- IAM Policies
- EC2 Instances
- EKS Clusters
- RDS Databases
- S3 Buckets

Once all the necessary resources are fetched, the Teleport Discovery Service pushes them to the
Access Graph, ensuring that it remains updated with the latest information from your AWS environment.

### Importing resources

Identity Security’s Access Graph feature delves into the IAM policies, identities,
and resources retrieved from your AWS account, crafting a
graphical representation thereof.


### Importing AWS CloudTrail logs (optional)

If CloudTrail is configured to log activity in your AWS account, it delivers log files to an S3 bucket.
Identity Activity Center can process trail data in near real time. Enabling Amazon SNS notifications
in the CloudTrail allows a new notification to be sent whenever a new log file is written.
This SNS topic is subscribed to an SQS queue, which acts as a buffer for incoming notifications.

Teleport subscribes to the SQS queue using its AWS integration and polls for new messages at regular
intervals. Each message contains metadata about the new object in S3, such as the bucket name and
object key. Teleport uses this information to fetch the corresponding CloudTrail log file directly
from S3.

Once the file is downloaded, Teleport parses the CloudTrail events and processes them for audit and
security purposes. This allows Teleport to provide continuous visibility into activity across AWS
services, including login attempts, API calls, and changes to infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport Enterprise cluster v18.0.0 or later.
- Identity Security enabled for your account.
- For self-hosted clusters:
  - Ensure that an up-to-date `license.pem` is used in the Auth Service configuration.
  - A running Access Graph node v1.28.0 or later.
Check the [Identity Security page](../teleport-policy.mdx) for details on
how to set up Access Graph.
  - The node running the Access Graph service must be reachable from the Teleport Auth Service.
  - AWS CloudTrail setup with notifications being sent to a SNS topic.
  - AWS SQS queue receiving raw messages from CloudTrail SNS notifications.

## Step 1/3. Configure Discovery Service (Self-hosted only)

<Admonition type="warning">

If you have a cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster, you can disregard
this step, as cloud-hosted Teleport Enterprise already operates a properly configured
Discovery Service within your cluster.
</Admonition>

To activate the Teleport Discovery Service, add a top level discovery_service section to the teleport.yaml
config used by the Auth Service. This service monitors dynamic `discovery_config` resources that are set up
with the `discovery_group` matching.

<Var name="discovery-group" />.
```yaml
discovery_service:
  enabled: true
  discovery_group: <Var name="discovery-group" />
```

Notice that if you already operate a Discovery Service within your cluster,
it's possible to reuse it as long as the following requirements are met:

- On step 2, you match the `discovery_group` with the existing Discovery Service's
`discovery_group`.
- Access Graph service is reachable from the machine where Discovery Service runs.

## Step 2/3. Identity Activity Center CloudTrail integration (optional)

To enable the Identity Activity Center CloudTrail integration, you can use an existing
CloudTrail trail or create a new one. Trails can be scoped to a single AWS account or
configured as an AWS Organization trail to collect events from multiple accounts.

For near real-time access to CloudTrail data, Amazon SNS notifications must be enabled for
your trail. If SNS notifications are not already configured, go to your trail settings,
enable **SNS notification delivery**, and create a new SNS topic.

After setting up the SNS topic, create a new Standard Amazon SQS queue and subscribe it
to the SNS topic you just created. When configuring the subscription, make sure to enable
the **Enable raw message delivery** option. This setting is required—without it, Identity
Activity Center won't be able to parse the notifications correctly.

Although optional, enabling KMS encryption for both the SQS queue and the target S3 bucket
is strongly recommended. Be sure to configure the necessary KMS key permissions in the
following step so that Identity Security can successfully decrypt messages from SQS
and access CloudTrail logs in the S3 bucket.

## Step 3/3. Set up Access Graph AWS Sync

To initiate the setup wizard for configuring AWS Sync, access the Teleport UI,
click the Policy sidebar button, and then click Integrations.

Click the "Setup new integration" button, and then select "AWS". You'll be prompted
to create a new Teleport AWS integration if you haven't configured one already.
Alternatively, you can opt for a previously established integration.

Upon selecting or creating the integration, you'll be instructed to execute a
bash script within your AWS Cloud Shell to configure the necessary permissions.

<details>
<summary>List of IAM Policies required for AWS Sync</summary>

The policy is designed with a set of read-only actions, enabling Teleport
to access and retrieve information from resources within your AWS Account.

The IAM policy includes the following directives:


```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeImages",
        "ec2:DescribeTags",
        "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
        "ec2:DescribeKeyPairs",

        "eks:ListClusters",
        "eks:DescribeCluster",
        "eks:ListAccessEntries",
        "eks:ListAccessPolicies",
        "eks:ListAssociatedAccessPolicies",
        "eks:DescribeAccessEntry",

        "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
        "rds:DescribeDBClusters",
        "rds:ListTagsForResource",
        "rds:DescribeDBProxies",

        "dynamodb:ListTables",

        "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:GetBucketTagging",
        "s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus",
        "s3:GetBucketAcl",

        "iam:ListUsers",
        "iam:GetUser",
        "iam:ListRoles",
        "iam:ListGroups",
        "iam:ListPolicies",
        "iam:ListGroupsForUser",
        "iam:ListInstanceProfiles",
        "iam:ListUserPolicies",
        "iam:GetUserPolicy",
        "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies",
        "iam:ListGroupPolicies",
        "iam:GetGroupPolicy",
        "iam:ListAttachedGroupPolicies",
        "iam:GetPolicy",
        "iam:GetPolicyVersion",
        "iam:ListRolePolicies",
        "iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies",
        "iam:GetRolePolicy",
        "iam:ListSAMLProviders",
        "iam:GetSAMLProvider",
        "iam:ListOpenIDConnectProviders",
        "iam:GetOpenIDConnectProvider"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

```

If Identity Activity Center is enabled, two extra configurations are required:

- <Var name="aws-sqs-queue"/>: The ARN of the Amazon SQS queue subscribed to the SNS topic that receives CloudTrail notifications.
- <Var name="aws-s3-trail-bucket"/>: The arn of the Amazon S3 bucket where CloudTrail delivers its log files.
- <Var name="aws-sqs-kms-queue-key"/>: The ARN of the AWS KMS key used to encrypt messages in the SQS queue.
- <Var name="aws-s3-kms-key"/>: The ARN of the AWS KMS key used to encrypt objects in the S3 bucket that stores CloudTrail logs.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
        "sqs:DeleteMessage",
        "sqs:SendMessage"
      ],
      "Resource": "<Var name="aws-sqs-queue"/>"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:ListBucketVersions",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
      "Resource": "<Var name="aws-s3-trail-bucket"/>"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
          "kms:Decrypt",
          "kms:DescribeKey",
          "kms:GenerateDataKey",
          "kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext",
      ],
      "Resources": [
        "<Var name="aws-sqs-kms-queue-key"/>",
        "<Var name="aws-s3-kms-key"/>",
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
</details>


Once the IAM Policy has been successfully linked to the IAM role
utilized by Teleport, you'll be prompted to specify the regions from
which Teleport should import resources. This selection solely pertains
to regional resources and does not impact global resources such as S3
Buckets, IAM Policies, or IAM Users.

If you're operating a self-hosted cluster, you'll additionally need to
provide input for the `discovery_group` configured during Step 1.
