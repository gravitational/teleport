title: Analyze and Correlate Teleport Audit Logs
description: Describes how to import and correlate Teleport Audit Logs using Identity Security.
---

In this guide, you will configure your Teleport cluster to forward
Audit Logs to Identity Security product for better visibility
and alerts on suspicious activities.

(!docs/pages/includes/policy/identity-activity-center.mdx!)

Identity Activity Center is a feature of [Teleport Identity Security](https://goteleport.com/platform/identity-security/)
product that is only available to Teleport Enterprise customers.

## How it works

Your Teleport cluster will continuously monitor incoming Audit Logs and
forward them to Identity Security, where they will be ingested, standardized,
analyzed, and stored for long-term retention.

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport Enterprise cluster v18.0.0 or later.
- Identity Security enabled for your account.
- For self-hosted clusters:
  - Ensure that an up-to-date `license.pem` is used in the Auth Service configuration.
  - A running Access Graph node v1.28.0 or later with Identity Activity Center enabled.
Check the [Identity Security page](../teleport-policy.mdx) for details on
how to set up Access Graph and enable Identity Activity Center.


## Step 1/1. Enable Teleport Audit Log export

This section will guide you through the process of configuring your Teleport cluster to
export audit logs to Teleport Identity Security.

<Admonition type="note">

`start_date` parameter is optional. When not set, it will default to 10 days prior to the first successful
audit log export. This parameter can't be modified afterwards.

</Admonition>

Please select the deployment mode used to deploy your cluster.

<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster">

When running a self-hosted cluster, edit each one of your Teleport Auth Service
instances' configuration files, by default `/etc/teleport.yaml`, and merge the
following YAML snippet:

```yaml
access_graph:
    # <...>

    audit_log:
        # enables Audit Log export from Teleport
        enabled: true
        # start_date is an optional field. It defines the date when
        # Identity Activity Center should ingest the Teleport Logs.
        # If not defined, it defaults to 10 days prior to the first init.
        #
        # start_date: "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z"

```

Once completed, restart your Teleport Auth Service with:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart teleport
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Self-hosted cluster using Helm Chart">

When the Teleport cluster was installed using `teleport-cluster` Helm chart, update the values for the deployment
and include the following details:

```yaml
auth:
  teleportConfig:
    # <...>

    # Add a section for configuring the Access Graph connection.
    access_graph:
        # <...>
        audit_log:
            # enables Audit Log export from Teleport
            enabled: true
            # start_date is an optional field. It defines the date when
            # Identity Activity Center should ingest the Teleport Logs.
            # If not defined, it defaults to 10 days prior to the first init.
            #
            # start_date: "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z"


```

`start_date` parameter is optional. When not set, it will default to 10 days prior to the first successful
audit log export. This parameter can't be modified afterwards.

If not using the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart, you will need to do the equivalent changes to your Teleport cluster deployment:
- Add the `access_graph:` section at the top-level of the YAML config file for the Teleport Auth Service.
- Mount the created ConfigMap as a volume so that the Auth Service can read the CA certificate.

Finally, redeploy the Helm chart (assuming the values are stored in
`values-teleport.yaml`).  Once the Auth Service changes succeed, restart the
Proxy Service. Assign <Var name="teleport-cluster-deployment-name" /> to the
name of your `teleport-cluster` deployment:

```code
$ helm upgrade -n <Var name="teleport-cluster-namespace" /> -f values-teleport.yaml \
  --version <version> <Var name="teleport-cluster-deployment-name" /> teleport/teleport-cluster
$ kubectl -n <Var name="teleport-cluster-namespace" /> rollout status deployment/teleport-auth   # Wait for the deployment to succeed
$ kubectl -n <Var name="teleport-cluster-namespace" /> rollout restart deployment/teleport-proxy
$ kubectl -n <Var name="teleport-cluster-namespace" /> rollout status deployment/teleport-proxy  # Wait for the deployment to succeed
```
