Teleport can integrate with identity providers (IdPs) like Okta and AWS OIDC
which can then be used with Identity Security, providing a comprehensive,
interactive view of how users, roles, and resources are interconnected, enabling
administrators to better understand and control access policies.

Read the following guides for information on using Teleport Identity Security to
visualize role-based access controls from third-party services:

## Viewing available integrations

The Integrations page shows integrations that can be enabled or are already
enabled in Access Graph. Press the **Setup New Integration** button from that page
to see the available integrations.

Resources imported into Teleport through Teleport-enabled integrations are
automatically imported into Identity Security without any additional
configuration.

To access the interface, your user must have a role that allows `list` and `read` verbs on the `access_graph` resource, e.g.:  

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: my-role
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      - access_graph
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
```

The preset `editor` role has the required permissions by default.

## Set up a new integration

On the left sidebar, click **Identity Security**. Click the connection icon labeled Integrations:
