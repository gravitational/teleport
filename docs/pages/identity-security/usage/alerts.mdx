Teleport Identity Security provides 50 pre-built security detections that automatically create alerts for suspicious identity-related activities across your infrastructure. These detections monitor events from Teleport and integrated services like AWS, GitHub, and Okta to identify potential security risks.


Teleport Identity Security alerts help you detect and respond to security threats by monitoring for:
- Unusual authentication patterns
- Privilege escalations
- Configuration changes that affect security
- Account compromises
- Policy violations

All detections are pre-configured and currently cannot be modified. The severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) are defined by the Identity Security team based on the potential impact of each detection.

## Detection Categories

### AWS detections

Teleport Identity Security monitors your AWS infrastructure for critical security events:

**Critical and high severity:**
- Root account activities (console login, access key creation, general activity)
- Security settings deletions (CloudTrail, GuardDuty, flow logs)
- EBS encryption disabled
- DB snapshots made public
- Exposed credential policy modifications
- Login profile updates

**Medium and low severity:**
- IAM user creation
- DB snapshot attribute modifications
- AWS key deletion or disabling

### GitHub detections

Monitor your GitHub organizations and repositories for security-relevant changes:

**Critical and high severity:**
- Organization security updates (SAML, 2FA, OAuth restrictions)
- Protected branch policy overrides or deletions
- Repository access and visibility changes
- Secret scanning alerts
- Organization member updates

**Medium & Low Severity:**
- Repository member updates
- Organization moderator additions
- Integration installations

**Advanced Security Detections:**
The system includes 26 sub-types of GitHub advanced security change detections that monitor for modifications to security features like Dependabot alerts.

### Okta detections

Track identity and access management events in your Okta environment:

**High Severity:**
- Admin MFA disabled
- All MFA factors reset
- OAuth token reuse patterns
- Rate limit violations
- Sign-on policy evaluations
- IDP lifecycle changes
- API token creation/revocation
- Security threat events

**Medium Severity:**
- Excessive MFA failures
- Multiple password reset attempts
- Dormant account access
- Support-initiated password or MFA resets

### Teleport Detections

Monitor Teleport-specific security events:

**High Severity:**
- Root SSH session initiation
- Authentication without MFA for local accounts
- Unusual authentication failure patterns
- Role creation/updates/deletions
- Connector updates
- Unusual session commands

### Cross-Platform Detections

**Impossible Travel Detection** (GitHub, Okta, Teleport):
- Severity: High
- Triggers when login attempts occur from multiple geographic locations within a timeframe that makes legitimate travel physically impossible

## Alert Management

### Current Capabilities
- View alerts across all integrated systems
- Filter by severity level
- Investigate related events

### Planned Features
- Alert resolution workflows
- Acknowledgment and muting capabilities
- Forwarding alerts to external services 
- Custom detection creation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I write my own detections?
No, detections are currently pre-configured per integration and cannot be customized.

### Can I resolve an alert?
Not currently, but we plan to add workflows to resolve, acknowledge, and mute alert types in future updates.

### What determines the severity level?
Severity levels are defined by the Identity Security Team based on the potential security impact. Feedback on severity assignments is welcome.

### Can I forward these events to another service?
This feature is planned for future release.

### How can I request new detection types?
For new detection requests based on customer needs, reach out to the Identity Security Team. Customer feedback is welcomed and helps prioritize new detection development.
