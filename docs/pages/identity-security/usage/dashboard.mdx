The standing privileges dashboard provides an overview of resources that an
identity can access without creating an Access Request. Standing privileges
allow an attacker to access infrastructure resources with compromised
credentials, and you can use the standing privileges dashboard as a guide for
reducing the attack surface of your infrastructure. 

Teleport Identity Security sources standing privileges from Teleport roles as
well as [integrations](../integrations/integrations.mdx), counting
Teleport-protected resources as well as access controls and resources from your
cloud provider and third-party solutions.

To visit the standing privileges dashboard, navigate to **Identity Security** >
**Dashboard**.
