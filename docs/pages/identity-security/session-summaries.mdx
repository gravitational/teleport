Teleport Identity Security allows you to generate and view session recording
summaries for shell and database sessions. This allows you to see at a glance
what your users do and estimate legitimacy of their actions before digging
deeper and reviewing the entire recording.

<Admonition type="warning">
This feature is powered by AI, and as such, its accuracy may vary.

Teleport doesn't currently support any spend controls; controlling the LLM
token budget is your responsibility.
</Admonition>

## How it works

Teleport can automatically summarize any recorded interactive SSH or Kubernetes
session, as well as any recorded database session.

After each session finishes, Teleport decides if it should be summarized by
matching it against a set of policies which route sessions to LLMs. Exactly
which sessions are summarized and which model is used can be decided on using
session, resource, and user metadata, such as session kind, session
participants, resource labels, user traits, etc.

If a match is found, Teleport proceeds to summarize the session recording. It
uses an inference model configuration indicated by the policy to generate a
summary using an external inference provider, such as OpenAI. There is no way
to run this process on demand.

There are three fundamental concepts to that underpin session summarization:

- **Inference providers** do the heavy lifting of summarization. Currently,
  Teleport only supports OpenAI or compatible inference providers.
- **Inference models** indicate *how* sessions get summarized: they are
  Teleport configuration resources that provide model settings.
- **Inference policies** indicate *what* gets summarized and which inference
  model is used in given case.

## Prerequisites

- A running Teleport Enterprise cluster v18.2.0 or later with Identity Security
  enabled.
- Access to OpenAI or OpenAI-compatible inference API, either public or
  self-hosted.

## Step 1/4: Configure access to inference configuration

In order to manage the summary inference configuration, you need a write access
to `inference_model`, `inference_secret`, and `inference_policy` resources,
which is granted by default through the preset `editor` role.

Alternatively, you can create a new role to make sure you have
access to all necessary resources. To create a new role:

1. Create a `summarizer-admin.yaml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   metadata:
     name: summarizer-admin
   spec:
     allow:
       rules:
       - resources:
         - inference_model
         - inference_secret
         - inference_policy
         verbs:
         - read
         - list
         - create
         - update
         - delete
   version: v7
   ```

1. Apply your changes:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f summarizer-admin.yaml
   ```

   (!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

1. (!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="summarizer-admin"!)

## Step 2/4: Create the inference configuration resources

Let's start by defining an `inference_model` resource. It tells Teleport how to
summarize a session by pointing it to a large language model (LLM) API. In
particular, it contains an API-specific model name. Note that the *Teleport
inference model name* and *API-specific model name* are two different things.
This allows, for example, using the same OpenAI model with different
temperature settings or using different API gateways by creating multiple
Teleport inference models with the same OpenAI model name.

To communicate with OpenAI, an inference model needs an API key. It's stored
separately in an `inference_secret` resource and referenced by the
`inference_model`'s `spec.openai.api_key_secret_ref` field.

<Admonition type="warning">
To protect your API key, once written, an `inference_secret` value cannot be
retrieved through `tctl` or Teleport API. It can only be updated or deleted.
</Admonition>

Finally, we add an `inference_policy` that routes sessions to inference models
using session kinds and optional custom filters. Only one policy is allowed to
match a given session to guarantee that its recording will be summarized at
most once. Policies are checked in alphabetical order of names and the first
one that matches is used. Here are some example scenarios that can be expressed
using inference policies:

- Only summarize sessions to your production resources using resource labels.
- Use different models for summarizing shell and database sessions.

See [Session matching examples](#session-matching-examples) for details on how
to configure Teleport to achieve these goals.

To create the required configuration resources:

1. Create an `inference-config.yaml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   kind: inference_model
   version: v1
   metadata:
     name: shell-summary-model
   spec:
     # "openai" is currently the only supported inference provider.
     openai:
       # In this scenario, where we connect to OpenAI directly, openai_model_id
       # needs to be a valid OpenAI model name.
       openai_model_id: gpt-4o
       # This value refers to the `inference_secret` resource name.
       api_key_secret_ref: openai-key
     # It's a good idea to limit the session length to prevent incurring cost for
     # sessions that were too long anyway to fit in the model's context window.
     # If unset, defaults to 200kB. See the Limitations section for more details.
     max_session_length_bytes: 190000

   ---

   kind: inference_secret
   version: v1
   metadata:
     name: openai-key
   spec:
     value: '<paste-your-openai-api-key-here>'

   ---

   kind: inference_policy
   version: v1
   metadata:
     name: shell-sessions
     description: Summarize all sessions using OpenAI
   spec:
     # Session kinds affected by this policy. Allowed values: "ssh", "k8s", "db".
     kinds:
     - ssh
     - k8s
     - db
     # Name of the `inference_model` resource that will be used for summarizing
     # these sessions.
     model: shell-summary-model
   ```

1. Create the configuration resources in the backend:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f inference-config.yaml
   ```

For full description of the inference configuration resources, see appropriate
sections of [Teleport Resources Reference](../reference/resources.mdx):

- [`inference_model`](../reference/resources.mdx#inference-model)
- [`inference_secret`](../reference/resources.mdx#inference-secret)
- [`inference_policy`](../reference/resources.mdx#inference-policy)

## Step 3/4: Configure access to session summaries

Every user who has access to
[given session recording](../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx#rbac-for-session-recordings)
also has access to its summary through a `session` resource kind. The preset
`access` role allows users to only view their sessions; in order to allow a
user to view all recordings and summaries, it's easiest to use the preset
`auditor` role.

You can either use the built-in roles or create a new one to make sure you have
access to all recordings. To create a new role:

1. Create a `summary-auditor.yaml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   metadata:
     name: summary-auditor
   spec:
     allow:
       rules:
       - resources:
         - session
         verbs:
         - read
         - list
   version: v7
   ```

1. Apply your changes:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f summary-auditor
   ```

1. (!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="summary-auditor"!)

## Step 4/4: Conduct a session and view its summary

That's it! We are ready to conduct a test session. Connect to any of your
cluster resources using `tsh ssh`, `kubectl exec`, `tsh db connect`, or a web
terminal. Start an interactive session and execute any command, quit the
session, and go to **Audit -> Session Recordings**. You should see the
corresponding recording tile with a summary button
![summary button](../../img/identity-security/summary-button.png). Clicking the
summary button will show the summary.

<Admonition type="info">
It can take a while to generate a summary, and the time depends on multiple
factors, including session size, model, and its temperature. Usually it should
appear up to a minute after the session is uploaded to the Auth service.
</Admonition>

## Limitations

Currently, Teleport doesn't attempt to summarize sessions that are larger than
the model's context window. If after tokenization, the session turns out to be
larger than that, OpenAI will simply reject the request; the input tokens used
will be wasted. To prevent this, Teleport allows you to customize the maximum
size of session that may be sent to the inference provider by using the
`spec.max_session_length_bytes` field of the `inference_model` resource. Note
that there's no way to provide an exact number of bytes for a given model here;
in our experiments, we observed between 2 and 4 bytes per token, depending on
the model and input.

## Selecting sessions to summarize

Indiscriminately summarizing all sessions in your cluster can increase
costs, so it's recommended to be specific about which sessions will be
summarized and which model will be used for inference. One of these mechanisms
— selecting sessions by kind — was mentioned already in the above example. In
addition to matching by kind, it's also possible to add a custom filter to each
inference policy, which can be used to summarize only sessions that target
production resources, are attended by certain users, etc.

Filters are expressed using the [Teleport predicate language](#predicate-language).
If an inference policy contains a filter, it will match only sessions that
match one of the indicated kinds *and* the specified filter.

### Session matching examples

A typical case would be to pick only production resources for summarizing. The
following example policy only matches Kubernetes sessions in any of the
production clusters, picked by matching cluster labels:

```yaml
kind: inference_policy
version: v1
metadata:
  name: prod-k8s-sessions
  description: Summarize production Kubernetes sessions
spec:
  kinds:
  - k8s
  filter: 'equals(resource.metadata.labels["env"], "prod")'
  model: shell-summary-model
```

The following example uses two policies to route shell and database sessions to
two different models. It assumes that there are two `inference_model` resources
created: `database-summary-model` and `shell-summary-model`.

```yaml
kind: inference_policy
version: v1
metadata:
  name: shell-policy
spec:
  kinds: ['ssh', 'k8s']
  model: shell-summary-model

---

kind: inference_policy
version: v1
metadata:
  name: db-policy
spec:
  kinds: ['db']
  model: db-summary-model
```

### Predicate Language

Inference policy filters are expressed using Teleport predicate language. In
this case, the language supports the following operators:

| Operator | Meaning                             | Example                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| &&       | and (all conditions must match)     | `contains(field1, field2) && equals(field2, "val")`      |
| \|\|     | or (any one condition should match) | `contains(field1, field2) \|\| contains(field1, "val2")` |
| !        | not (used with functions)           | `!equals(field1, field2)`                                |
| ==       | equal to                            | `resource.metadata.labels["env"] == "prod"`              |
| !=       | not equal to                        | `resource.metadata.labels["env"] != "prod"`              |

The language also supports the following functions:

| Functions                         | Return type | Description                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `contains(list, item)`            | `Boolean`   | Returns true if `item` is included in the `list`                                                                                           |
| `equals(a, b)`                    | `Boolean`   | Returns true if value `a` is equal to `b`                                                                                                  |
| `contains_all(list, items)`       | `Boolean`   | Returns true if all `items` are included in the `list`                                                                                     |
| `contains_any(list, items)`       | `Boolean`   | Returns true if any of `items` is included in the `list`                                                                                   |
| `set(value1, value2, ...)`        | `[]string`  | Returns a list of strings                                                                                                                  |
| `all_end_with(a, suffix)`         | `Boolean`   | If `a` is a list, returns true if all strings in the `a` end with `suffix`. If `a` is a string, returns true if `a` ends with `suffix`.    |
| `all_equal(a, b)`                 | `Boolean`   | If `a` is a list, returns true if all items in `a` are equal to `b`. If `a` is a string, returns true if it's equal to `b`.                |
| `is_subset(a, item1, item2, ...)` | `Boolean`   | If `a` is a list, returns true if `list(item1, item2, ...)` is a subset of `a`. If `a` is a string, returns true if the list contains `a`. |
| `has_prefix(s, prefix)`           | `Boolean`   | Returns true if string `s` starts with `prefix`                                                                                            |

It's possible to build predicates using information about target resource,
session, and user.

| Field                            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

## Using LiteLLM and other OpenAI-compatible proxies

Although the only officially supported inference provider is currently OpenAI,
it's also possible to use any OpenAI-compatible API for this purpose. For
example, you may want to route some or all sessions to another provider or even
host your language models on premises. One way to do it is using LiteLLM.
Here's what you need to do:

1. Set up [LiteLLM Proxy Server (LLM
   Gateway)](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/#litellm-proxy-server-llm-gateway) on a
   host accessible from the Teleport Auth server.
2. Add a model of your choice to the LiteLLM configuration. In this example,
   let's call it `my-custom-model`.
3. Configure a Teleport inference model. Use `spec.openai.base_url` property to
   point Teleport to your LiteLLM instance and put `my-custom-model` in
   `spec.openai.openai_model_id`.
4. Add an `inference_secret` containing your LiteLLM master key.

Here is an example configuration:

```yaml
kind: inference_model
version: v1
metadata:
  name: lite-llm-summary-model
spec:
  openai:
    # In case of LiteLLM Proxy, the openai_model_id is the public model name as
    # configured in LiteLLM.
    openai_model_id: my-custom-model
    api_key_secret_ref: lite-llm-master-key
    base_url: http://llm-host:4000/

---

kind: inference_secret
version: v1
metadata:
  name: lite-llm-master-key
spec:
  # In case of LiteLLM, the API key is *not* your OpenAI key; instead, use your
  # LiteLLM master key.
  value: '<paste-your-master-key-here>'
```

## Monitoring

Teleport exposes a couple of useful Prometheus metrics that can be used to
monitor the session summarizer. Metrics are labeled by inference model name,
and in case of OpenAI errors — additionally with the OpenAI API error code. See
the [Teleport Metrics
reference](../reference/monitoring/metrics.mdx#session-recording-summarizer)
for details.
