Teleport Identity Security unifies management of access policies across your infrastructure.
It hardens your access controls and displays up-to-date relationships and policies of all
users, groups, and computing resources.

It can help you answer questions like:

- What resources can a specific user access?
- What users can access a specific resource?
- What are the relationships between users, roles, and resources?

## Getting started with Identity Security

To start using Identity Security to explore access paths and identity-related
activity in your infrastructure, read [Get Started with Identity
Security](usage/usage.mdx).

Identity Security is a separately licensed product and is available to Teleport
Enterprise customers.

## Enabling Identity Security integrations

You can configure Teleport Identity Security to integrate with third-party
services so you can visualize access paths and identity-related activity from
your cloud platform, code repositories, and more, all in a single view. Read
[Identity Security Integrations](integrations/integrations.mdx) for
instructions.

## Self-hosting Identity Security

Self-hosted Teleport Enterprise customers must deploy Identity Security on their
own infrastructure. Learn about the services you need to deploy in [Self-Host
Teleport Identity Security](access-graph/access-graph.mdx).
