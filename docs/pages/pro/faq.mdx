### Can I use Teleport Pro Preview in production?

We expect Teleport Pro to be suitable to use in non-mission-critical systems that do not require 24/7 access or a guaranteed SLA. 

We recommend a fallback option be available in the event of error or outage.

### Are you using AWS-managed encryption keys, or CMKs via KMS?

We use AWS-managed keys. 

Currently, there is no option to provide your own key.

### Is this Teleport's S3 bucket or my bucket based on my AWS credentials?

It's a Teleport-managed S3 bucket with AWS-managed keys.

Currently, there is no way to provide your own bucket.

### How do I add nodes to Teleport Pro?

You can connect servers, kubernetes clusters, databases and applications using [reverse tunnels](../admin-guide.mdx#adding-a-node-located-behind-nat).

There is no need to open any ports on your infrastructure for inbound traffic.

### How can I access the tctl admin tool?

We have made changes to allow you to log into your cluster using `tsh`, then use `tctl` remotely:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=myinstance.teleport.sh:443
# tctl (Enterprise edition) can use tsh credentials as of version 5.0
tctl status
```

### Why am I getting `permission denied` errors when using `tctl`?

If you have a local file `/etc/teleport.yaml` on your machine `tctl` will attempt to use the local cluster. Set the environment variable `TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE` to `""` so it will not attempt to use that Teleport configuration file.

```bash
$ export TELEPORT_CONFIG_FILE=""
$ tctl tokens add --type=node
```

### Are dynamic node tokens available?

After [connecting](#how-can-i-access-the-tctl-admin-tool) `tctl` to Teleport Pro, users can generate
[dynamic tokens](../admin-guide.mdx#short-lived-dynamic-tokens):

```bash
tctl nodes add --ttl=5m --roles=node,proxy --token=$(uuid)
```

### What does Teleport Pro run in?

Teleport Pro is deployed using a [Gravity](https://github.com/gravitational/gravity)
cluster on AWS.

### Will Teleport be automatically upgraded with each release?

We will be upgrading the preview version of Teleport Pro automatically.

We will add an option to trigger upgrades manually and automatically within a configurable maintenance window.

### Does your SOC2 report include Teleport Pro?

(!docs/pages/includes/soc2.mdx!)

### When will a security audit be available?

See the SOC2 answer above.

### Can a customer deploy multiple clusters in Teleport Pro?

Not at this time.

### Is FIPS mode an option?

FIPS is not currently an option for Teleport Pro clusters.

### How do you store passwords?

Password hashes are generated using [Golang's bcrypt](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).

### How does Teleport manage web certificates? Can I upload my own?

Teleport uses [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/) to issue certificates for every customer. 

It's not possible to upload a custom certificate or use a custom domain name.

### Do you encrypt data at rest?

Each deployment is using at-rest encryption using AWS DynamoDB and S3 at-rest encryption for customer data including session recordings and user records.
