---

This guide shows you how to install Teleport binaries on your platform,
including:
- `teleport`
- `tsh`
- `tctl`
- `tbot`

If you are new to Teleport, we recommend following our [getting started
guide](./index.mdx).

For best results, Teleport clients (`tsh`, `tctl`, `tbot`) should be the same major
version as the cluster they are connecting to. Teleport servers are compatible
with clients that are on the same major version or one major version older.
Teleport servers do not support clients that are on a newer major version.

See our [Upgrading](./upgrading.mdx) guide for more information.


## Operating system support

Teleport is officially supported on the platforms listed below. It is worth
noting that the open-source community has been successful in building and
running Teleport on UNIX variants other than Linux \[1].

| Operating System | `teleport` Daemon | `tctl` Admin Tool | `tsh` and Teleport Connect User Clients [2] | Web UI (via the browser) | `tbot` Daemon |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Linux v2.6.23+ (RHEL/CentOS 7+, Amazon Linux 2+, Amazon Linux 2023+, Ubuntu 16.04+, Debian 9+, SLES 12 SP 5+, and SLES 15 SP 5+) \[3] | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| macOS v10.13+  (High Sierra)| yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Windows 10+ (rev. 1607) \[4] | no | no | yes | yes | no |

\[1] *Teleport is written in Go and many of these system requirements are due to the requirements
of the [Go toolchain](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MinimumRequirements)*.

\[2] *`tsh` is a Command Line Client (CLI) and Teleport Connect is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) desktop client. See
  [Using Teleport Connect](connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx) for usage and installation*.

\[3] *Enhanced Session Recording requires Linux kernel v5.8+*.

\[4] *Teleport server does not run on Windows yet, but `tsh` and Teleport Connect (the Teleport desktop clients)
supports most features on Windows 10 and later.*

## Linux

All installations include `teleport`, `tsh`, `tctl`, and `tbot`.

### Feature support

Some Teleport features have additional requirements:

| Feature                                                                        | Requirement   | Debian                   | Ubuntu   | CentOS/RHEL | Amazon Linux           | SLES           |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------|-------------|------------------------|----------------|
| [Enhanced Session Recording](./enroll-resources/server-access/guides/bpf-session-recording.mdx) | Kernel  v5.8+ | 11, or 10 with backports | 20.04.2+ | 9+          | 2 (post 11/2021), 2023 | 12 SP5, 15 SP5 |
| Automatic Updates                                                              | systemd-based | 9+                       | 16.04+   | 7+          | 2, 2023                | 12 SP5, 15 SP5 |
| Installation through apt/yum/zypper repos                                      | systemd-based | 9+                       | 16.04+   | 7+          | 2, 2023                | 12 SP5, 15 SP5 |

<Admonition type="note">
`apt`, `yum`, and `zypper` repos don't expose packages for all distribution variants.
When following installation instructions, you might need to replace `ID` with
`ID_LIKE` to install packages of the closest supported distribution.

Currently supported distributions (and `ID`) are:
- RHEL >= 7 (`rhel`)
- CentOS >= 7 (`centos`)
- Debian >= 9 (`debian`)
- Ubuntu >= 16.04 (`ubuntu`)
- Amazon Linux 2 and 2023 (`amzn`)
- SLES >= 12 SP5, >= 15 SP5 (`sles`)

## Docker

### Images

We provide a pre-built Docker image for every version of Teleport. This section
describes the available Docker images.

These images are hosted on [Amazon ECR
Public](https://gallery.ecr.aws/gravitational).

#### Image suffixes

For each of the image names listed in this section, you can specify attributes
of the image by appending a suffix to the repository name or tag.

Images with the `-distroless` suffix within the repository name include only the
`teleport` binary and its runtime dependencies, with no shell or utility
applications. An example is `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless`
for Teleport Community Edition.

Images with the `*-distroless-debug` suffix within the repository name include a
Busybox shell and tool suite in addition to Teleport, and are intended for
troubleshooting deployments only. They are not intended for production use. An
example is `public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug`.

You can specify the architecture of an image by appending a suffix to its tag.
We support the following architecture suffixes: `amd64`, `arm`, and `arm64`. For
example, if you want to pull the ARM64 image for
`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport`, you can use
`public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport:(=teleport.version=)-arm64`.

`*-distroless` and `*-distroless-debug` images support multiple architectures
natively, and do not require (or support) image suffixes. You can specify an
architecture using the `--platform` flag of `docker pull` to pull the `arm`,
`arm64` or `amd64` version of an image.

#### Version tags

Images point to a static version of Teleport. Use the image's tag to specify
either:

- The major, minor, and patch version (e.g., `(=teleport.version=)` for the
  latest version of Teleport Community Edition).
- The major version only, which implies the latest minor and patch numbers for
  that major version. For example, `(=teleport.major_version=)` implies
  `(=teleport.version=)`.

### Running Teleport on Docker

When running a container from one of the images listed above, consider the
container equivalent to running the `teleport` binary. The Teleport container
requires access to a file system and network ports.

#### Configuration

Teleport processes read their configuration from a local file path, which is
`/etc/teleport.yaml` by default. Make sure this file path is mounted to your
Teleport container.

#### Data directory

All Teleport processes read from and write to a data directory, which by default
is `/var/lib/teleport`. Make sure the data directory is mounted to your Teleport
container.

#### License file

If your Teleport Enterprise container runs the Auth Service, you will need to
give it access to a license file at the path named in the configuration, which
is `/var/lib/teleport/license.pem` by default. Make sure a license exists at
this location in the Teleport container's data directory.

#### Other file paths

Depending on the configuration settings you assign on your Teleport container,
you will need to make sure that any file paths you name are mounted on the
container.

For example, if you are running the Teleport Proxy Service on a container, you
need to mount the directory containing TLS credentials to your Teleport
container, then assign the following fields in the container's configuration
file to the appropriate paths:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  https_keypairs:
  - key_file: /my/path/key.pem
    cert_file: /my/path/cert.pem
```

See the Teleport [Configuration Reference](reference/config.mdx) for whether a
field you would like to assign requires a file path.

#### Ports

A single Teleport process can run multiple services, each of which listens on a
specific set of ports depending on your configuration. See our [Networking
Reference](reference/networking.mdx#ports) for the ports on your Teleport
container to expose.

#### Extracting certificates from distroless images

Extracting certificates created with `tctl auth sign` from a container running
a distroless image can be tricky due to the absence of a shell and other OS tools.

Where possible you should log into the Teleport cluster using `tsh` and use
`tctl auth sign` locally to generate certificates. This way the action will be
logged against your Teleport user and be subject to all of the usual Teleport
RBAC policies in your cluster.

If this is not possible, use `tctl auth sign --tar` to collect all the files
generated by `tctl auth sign` into a `tar` archive, which is streamed directly
to `stdout`. The resulting certificates are never stored on the container
filesystem. You can either pipe this output directly to `tar`, or redirect it
to a local file for later use.

For example:

```code
docker exec ${TELEPORT_CONTAINER} \
  tctl auth sign --user alice --format tls -o alice.local --tar | tar xv
x alice.local.crt
x alice.local.key
x alice.local.cas
```

### Example of running a Teleport container

In this example, we will show you how to run the Teleport Auth and Proxy
Services on a local Docker container using Teleport Community Edition.

Since this container uses a self-signed certificate, we do not recommend using
this configuration to protect any infrastructure outside your workstation. You
can, however, join other local Docker containers to it using the [token
method](./enroll-resources/agents/join-services-to-your-cluster/join-token.mdx).

First, create directories in your home directory to mount to the container. The
Teleport container will write its configuration and data to these directories:

```code
$ mkdir -p ~/teleport/config ~/teleport/data
```

Run `teleport configure` from the Teleport container to generate a configuration
file. This sets the container's name to `localhost` so your browser can trust
the Proxy Service's self-signed TLS certificate:

```code
$ docker run --hostname localhost --rm \
  --entrypoint=/usr/local/bin/teleport \
  <Var name="(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)" /> configure --roles=proxy,auth > ~/teleport/config/teleport.yaml
```

Start Teleport on your container:

```code
$ docker run --hostname localhost --name teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/config:/etc/teleport \
  -v ~/teleport/data:/var/lib/teleport \
  -p 3025:3025 -p 3080:3080 \
  <Var name="(=teleport.latest_oss_docker_image=)" />
```

From there, open another terminal and make sure your Teleport container's web
API is functioning as intended:

```code
$ curl --insecure https://localhost:3080/webapi/ping
```

You should see JSON output similar to the following:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "local",
    "second_factor": "otp",
    "preferred_local_mfa": "otp",
    "local": {
      "name": ""
    },
    "private_key_policy": "none",
    "device_trust_disabled": true,
    "has_motd": false
  },
  "proxy": {
    "kube": {
      "enabled": true,
      "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "ssh": {
      "listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "tunnel_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "web_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "db": {
      "postgres_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080",
      "mysql_listen_addr": "0.0.0.0:3080"
    },
    "tls_routing_enabled": true
  },
  "server_version": "12.1.5",
  "min_client_version": "11.0.0",
  "cluster_name": "localhost",
  "automatic_upgrades": false
}
```

We are using the `--insecure` flag to trust Teleport's self-signed certificate.
In production, you will want to provision TLS credentials to the Proxy Service
from a trusted CA, e.g., Let's Encrypt.

## Amazon EC2

We provide pre-built `amd64` Amazon Linux 2023 based EC2 AMIs with Teleport
pre-installed.

These images are primarily intended for deploying a Teleport cluster using our
[reference Terraform code](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/examples/aws/terraform).

See the [AWS Single-Instance Deployment](deploy-a-cluster/deployments/aws-starter-cluster-terraform.mdx)
and the [Running Teleport Enterprise in High Availability mode on AWS using Terraform](deploy-a-cluster/deployments/aws-ha-autoscale-cluster-terraform.mdx)
guide for detailed usage examples.

In order to use these AMIs outside of the reference Terraform, you can configure
the Teleport installation by setting configuration variables in the
`/etc/teleport.d/conf` file on the EC2 instance. See the [Starter Cluster Configuration Template](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/tree/branch/v(=teleport.major_version=)/examples/aws/terraform/starter-cluster/data.tpl)
for a list of the available configuration options.

The image names all include the build timestamp (shown as `$TIMESTAMP` in the table
below), and are tagged for easier searching.

| Image name | Edition | FIPS support | AMI Tags | Owner Account ID |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| `teleport-oss-(=teleport.version=)-$TIMESTAMP` | OSS | No | `TeleportVersion: (=teleport.version=)`, `TeleportEdition: oss`, `TeleportFipsEnabled: false` | 146628656107 |
| `teleport-ent-(=teleport.version=)-$TIMESTAMP` | Enterprise | No | `TeleportVersion: (=teleport.version=)`, `TeleportEdition: ent`, `TeleportFipsEnabled: false` | 146628656107 |
| `teleport-ent-(=teleport.version=)-fips-$TIMESTAMP` | Enterprise | Yes | `TeleportVersion: (=teleport.version=)`, `TeleportEdition: ent`, `TeleportFipsEnabled: true` | 146628656107 |

All images are based on Amazon Linux 2023 and have been hardened using the
Amazon EC2 ImageBuilder [STIG](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/) hardening
component.

Teleport AMIs are automatically published to all [non-opt-in AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions).

## Helm

(!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/helm/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

  <Notice type="danger">

  The Teleport package in Homebrew is not maintained by Teleport and we can't
  guarantee its reliability or security.

  </Notice>

  ### Warnings

  We recommend the use of our [official
  Teleport packages](https://goteleport.com/download). Binaries provided by Homebrew
  are not signed by Teleport, so features that require signed and notarized binaries
  (TouchID, Device Trust) are not available in Homebrew builds.

  The `tctl` release available on Homebrew is the open source edition, and
  cannot manage configuration resources unique to Teleport Enterprise and
  Teleport Enterprise Cloud (e.g., OIDC and SAML connectors). For Teleport
  Enterprise and Enterprise Cloud, we recommend installing the official Teleport
  Enterprise edition of `tctl`.

  ### Installing Teleport with Homebrew

  To install Teleport with Homebrew, run the following command:

  ```code
  $ brew install teleport
  ```

  If you choose to use Homebrew, you must verify that the versions of `tsh`
  and `tctl` you run on your local machine are compatible with the versions
  you run on your infrastructure. Homebrew usually ships the latest release of
  Teleport, which may be incompatible with older versions. See our
  [compatibility policy](upgrading.mdx) for details.

  To verify versions, log in to your cluster and compare the output of `tctl status`
  against `tsh version` and `tctl version`.

## Building from source

Teleport is written in Go, and currently requires **go v(=teleport.golang=)** or
newer. Detailed instructions for building from source are available in the
[README](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport#building-teleport).

## Checksums

If you want to verify the integrity of a Teleport binary, SHA256 checksums are
available for all downloads on our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/download/).

![Teleport Checksum](../img/teleport-sha.png)

If you download Teleport via an automated system, you can programmatically
obtain the checksum by adding `.sha256` to the download link. This is the method
shown in the installation examples.

```code
$ export version=v(=teleport.version=)
# 'darwin' 'linux' or 'windows'
$ export os=linux
# '386' 'arm' on linux or 'amd64' for all distros
$ export arch=amd64
$ curl https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-$version-$os-$arch-bin.tar.gz.sha256
# <checksum> <filename>
```

## Uninstalling Teleport

If you wish to uninstall Teleport at any time, see our documentation on [Uninstalling Teleport](./management/admin/uninstall-teleport.mdx).
