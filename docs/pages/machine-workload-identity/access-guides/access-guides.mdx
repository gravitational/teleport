These guides cover how to configure a deployed `tbot` instance to produce
credentials that can be used for machine to machine access to different Teleport
resources.

It is a pre-requisite of these guides that Machine & Workload Identity has been
configured for your platform, see the
[Deploy Machine & Workload Identity](../deployment/deployment.mdx) guides for
information on how to do so.
