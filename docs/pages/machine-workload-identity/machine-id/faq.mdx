This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about Machine ID. For a
list of frequently asked questions about Teleport in general, see [Frequently
Asked Questions](../../faq.mdx).

## Can Machine ID be used within CI/CD jobs?

On CI/CD platforms where your workflow runs in an ephemeral environment (e.g
no persistent state exists between individual workflow runs), Machine ID works
best where a supported join method exists. These are:

- GitHub Actions
- CircleCI
- GitLab
- AWS
- GCP
- Azure
- Kubernetes
- Spacelift
- Terraform Cloud

On CI/CD platforms where you control the runner environment (e.g self-hosted
Jenkins runner), Machine ID can run as a daemon on the runner and the generated
credentials can be mounted into the environment of your individual workflow
runs.

## Can Machine ID be used with Trusted Clusters ?

You can use Machine ID for SSH access in trusted leaf clusters.

We currently do not support access to applications, databases, or Kubernetes
clusters in leaf clusters.

## Should I define allowed logins as user traits or within roles?

When defining the logins that your bot will be allowed to use, there are two
options:

- Directly adding the login to the `logins` section of the role that your bot
  will impersonate.
- Adding the login to the logins trait of the bot user, and impersonating a role
  that includes the `{{ internal.logins }}` role variable. This is usually done
  by providing the `--logins` parameter when creating the bot.

For simpler scenarios — where you only expect the bot to use a single output
or role — you can add the login to the logins trait of the bot user. This
approach allows you to leverage default roles like `access`.

For situations where your bot is producing certificates for different roles in
different outputs, it is important to consider whether using a login trait
grants access to resources that you didn't intend. To prevent a login trait from
granting access you didn't intend, we recommend that you create bespoke roles
that explicitly specify the logins that should be included in the certificates.

## Can Machine ID be used with per-session MFA?

We do not currently support Machine ID and per-session MFA. Enabling per-session
MFA globally, or for roles impersonated by Machine ID, will prevent credentials
produced by Machine ID from being used to connect to resources.

As a work-around, ensure that per-session MFA is enforced on individual roles
rather than enforced globally, and that it is not enforced for roles that you
will impersonate using Machine ID.

## Can Machine ID be used with Device Trust?

We do not currently support Machine ID and Device Trust. Requiring Device
Trust cluster-wide or for roles impersonated by Machine ID will prevent
credentials produced by Machine ID from being used to connect to resources.

As a work-around, configure Device Trust enforcement on a role-by-role basis
and ensure that it is not required for roles that you will impersonate using
Machine ID.

## Can Machine ID be used to generate long-lived certificates?

Machine ID cannot currently be used to generate certificates valid for longer
than 24 hours, and requests for longer certificates using the `credential_ttl`
parameter will be reduced to this 24 hour limit.

This limit serves multiple purposes. For one, it encourages security best
practices by only ever issuing very short lived certificates. Additionally, as
Machine ID allows for certificate renewal, this limit helps to prevent further
exploitation should a Machine ID identity be compromised: an attacker could use
a stolen renewable certificate to request very long lived certificates and
maintain access for a much longer period.

If your use case absolutely requires long-lived certificates,
[`tctl auth sign`](../../reference/cli/tctl.mdx#tctl-auth-sign) can
alternatively be used, however this loses the security benefits of Machine ID's
short-lived renewable certificates.

## Can Machine ID be used to connect to multiple Kubernetes clusters?

This is possible in Teleport v17.2.7 or higher, using the new `kubernetes/v2`
output type in `tbot`. This service can expose many clusters at once via
contexts in the generated `kubeconfig.yaml`, and if label selectors are used,
will dynamically add contexts as clusters are added and removed in Teleport.

Note that both `tbot` and the Teleport Proxy need to be running v17.2.7 to take
advantage of this functionality.

Refer to the
[CLI reference](../../reference/cli/tbot.mdx#tbot-start-kubernetesv2) and
[config reference](../../reference/machine-id/configuration.mdx#kubernetesv2)
for more information.

## Does `tbot` support Windows?

Yes, the `tbot` binary is available for Windows. It can be found in the client
tools archive that also includes `tsh` and `tctl`. See the
[Installing Teleport guide](../../installation.mdx) for further information.

However, there are a few limitations to be aware of:

- Functionality that relies on Unix Domain Sockets (e.g. SSH multiplexer,
  SPIFFE Workload API etc.) is not available.
- Functionality relating to the configuration of Symlink protection on directory
  destinations is not available.
- Functionality relating to the management of ACLs on directory destinations is
  not available.
- Most delegated join methods are unlikely to function correctly.

In some circumstances, it can be more practical to run `tbot` within Windows
Subsystem for Linux rather than running it natively on Windows. This will depend
on where the tools that will consume the output of `tbot` are running.
