title: Machine ID with Kubernetes Access
description: How to use Machine ID to access Kubernetes clusters
---

Teleport protects and controls access to Kubernetes
clusters. Machine ID can be used to grant machines secure, short-lived
access to these clusters.

In this guide, you will configure `tbot` to produce credentials that can be
used to access a Kubernetes cluster enrolled with your Teleport cluster.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- If you have not already connected your Kubernetes cluster to Teleport, follow
  [Enroll a Kubernetes Cluster](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/getting-started.mdx).
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- To configure the Kubernetes cluster, your client system will need to have
  `kubectl` installed. See the
  [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for
  installation instructions.
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the machine that will
  access Kubernetes clusters. For more information, see the
  [deployment guides](../deployment/deployment.mdx).
- To demonstrate connecting to the Kubernetes cluster, the machine that will
  access Kubernetes clusters will need to have `kubectl` installed. See the
  [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for
  installation instructions.

## Step 1/3. Configure Teleport and Kubernetes RBAC

First, we need to configure the RBAC for both Teleport and Kubernetes in order
to grant the bot the correct level of access.

When forwarding requests to the Kubernetes API on behalf of a bot, the
Teleport Proxy attaches the groups configured (using `kubernetes_groups`) in the
bot's Teleport roles to the request. These groups are then used to configure a
RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding in Kubernetes to grant specific permissions
within the Kubernetes cluster to the bot.

For the purpose of this guide, we will bind the `editor` group to the default
`edit` ClusterRole that is preconfigured in most Kubernetes clusters to give
the bot read and write access to resources in all the cluster namespaces.

When configuring this for a production environment, you should consider:

- If RoleBinding should be used instead of ClusterRoleBinding to limit the
  bot's access to a specific namespace.
- If a Role should be created that grants the bot the least privileges
  necessary rather than using a pre-existing general Role such as `edit`.

To bind the `editor` group to the `edit` Cluster Role, execute:

```code
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding teleport-editor-edit \
  --clusterrole=edit \
  --group=editor
```

With the appropriate RoleBinding configured in Kubernetes to grant access to
a specific group, you now need to add this group to the role that the bot
will impersonate when producing credentials. You also need to grant the bot
access through Teleport to the cluster itself. This is done by creating a
role that grants the necessary permissions and then assigning this role to a
Bot.

Create a file called `role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_groups:
    - editor
    kubernetes_resources:
    - kind: "*"
      namespace: "*"
      name: "*"
      verbs: ["*"]
```

Replace `example-role` with a descriptive name related to your use case.

Adjust the `allow` field for your environment:

- `kubernetes_labels` should be adjusted to grant access to only the clusters
  that the bot will need to access. The value shown, `'*': '*'` will grant
  access to all Kubernetes clusters.
- `editor` must match the name of the group you specified in the
  RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.
- `kubernetes_resources` can be used to apply additional restrictions to what
  the bot can access within the Kubernetes cluster. These restrictions are
  layered upon the RBAC configured within the Kubernetes role itself.

Use `tctl create -f ./role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and `example-role`
with the name of the role you just created:

```code
$ tctl bots update example --add-roles example-role
```

## Step 2/3. Configure a Kubernetes `tbot` output

Now, `tbot` needs to be configured with an output to produce the Kubernetes
credentials and client configuration file. This is done using the `kubernetes`
output type.

The Kubernetes cluster you want the credentials to have access to must
be specified using the `kubernetes_cluster` field. In this example,
`example-k8s-cluster` will be used.

The output must be configured with a destination and the name of the
Kubernetes cluster that should be encoded in the credentials produced by `tbot`.
At this time, each output can only contain credentials for a single Kubernetes
cluster. If your bot needs to connect to multiple Kubernetes clusters,
create an output for each cluster.

Outputs must also be configured with a destination. In this example, the
`directory` type will be used. This will write artifacts to a specified
directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can be written to by the Linux
user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by the Linux user that will
be accessing the Kubernetes cluster.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add a `kubernetes` output:

```yaml
outputs:
  - type: kubernetes
    # Specify the name of the Kubernetes cluster you wish the credentials to
    # grant access to.
    kubernetes_cluster: example-k8s-cluster
    destination:
      type: directory
          # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
          # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
          # destination.
      path: /opt/machine-id
```

Ensure you replace `example-k8s-cluster` with the name of the Kubernetes cluster
as registered in Teleport and adjust `/opt/machine-id` if you wish

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to use the credentials.

## Step 3/3. Connect to your Kubernetes cluster with the Machine ID identity

Once `tbot` has been run with the new output configured, a file called
`kubeconfig.yaml` should have been generated in the destination directory
you specified. This contains all the information necessary for `kubectl` to
connect to the Kubernetes cluster through the Teleport Proxy.

To use `kubeconfig.yaml` with `kubectl`, the `--kubeconfig` flag or `KUBECONFIG`
environment variable can be provided to `kubectl`:

```code
$ kubectl --kubeconfig /opt/machine-id/kubeconfig.yaml get pods -A
# Or, set the KUBECONFIG environment variable:
$ export KUBECONFIG=/opt/machine-id/kubeconfig.yaml
$ kubectl get pods -A
```

Whilst this guide has demonstrated `kubeconfig.yaml` being used with `kubectl`,
this format is compatible with most Kubernetes tools including:

- Helm
- Lens
- ArgoCD
