Ansible AWX, formerly known as Ansible Tower, is an interface on top of Ansible
that can be used to run and coordinate Ansible workflows. These workflows
connect to remote hosts via SSH which requires a form of authentication. Machine
ID can provide short-lived certificates to Ansible jobs run via AWX that allow
the job to connect to SSH nodes enrolled in Teleport in a secure and auditable
manner.

This guide applies both to open-source Ansible AWX as well as Red Hat's
commercial Ansible Automation Platform automation controller, which is
built on top of the open-source Ansible AWX engine.

## How it works

In this guide, you will configure a container group in Ansible AWX to run
Machine ID's `tbot` client as a sidecar, which will provide credentials
and a high-performance multiplexing proxy to your Ansible AWX jobs. You'll then
configure Ansible to use these credentials to connect to SSH nodes through the
Teleport Proxy Service.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A working Ansible AWX installation (or Ansible Tower, or Ansible Automation
  Platform)
- You must have permissions to create a new container group.
- This guide does not apply to instance groups running outside of Kubernetes:
  these can be treated as traditional Ansible nodes and should follow our
  [traditional Ansible guide](./ansible.mdx) instead.
- While not required, you may wish to read our guides on [Deploying tbot
  in Kubernetes](../deployment/kubernetes.mdx) or [Deploying tbot in
  Kubernetes with OIDC](../deployment/kubernetes-oidc.mdx) to learn more about
  how to deploy Machine ID in Kubernetes, which is the foundation of the steps
  we'll be taking in this guide.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Configure Teleport resources

{/* TODO: Consider recommending use of `tctl tokens configure-kube` once it is
widely available. */}

To begin, we'll need to create three new Teleport resources:
1. A Teleport role to that will grant the `tbot` sidecar access to your desired
   SSH nodes
1. A bot resource to name the bot and specify its list of allowed roles
2. A join token to allow the bot to authenticate to Teleport

For this example we'll assume your AWX jobs will run on a Kubernetes cluster
where bots can join using the [Kubernetes `static_jwks` joining
mode](../../../reference/deployment/join-methods.mdx#kubernetes-jwks).

<Admonition type="tip" title="OIDC Joining">
Kubernetes clusters running on cloud providers like Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, and
Google Kubernetes Engine frequently rotate their JWKS keys and should instead
use Kubernetes OIDC joining. Refer to our [Kubernetes OIDC joining
guide](../deployment/kubernetes-oidc.mdx#step-15-verify-support-for-service-account-issuer-discovery)
to learn how to configure the join token on these providers.
</Admonition>

Run the following command to determine your cluster's JWKS keys:
```code
$ kubectl get --raw /openid/v1/jwks
{"keys":[--snip--]}
```

These keys will allow Teleport to verify that a bot trying to authenticate is
using a JWT signed by your trusted Kubernetes cluster. Keep this value available
for the next step.

Next, create `awx-bot-resources.yaml` with the following content containing the
three resources described above:
```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    # Allow login to the Linux user 'root'.
    logins: ['root']
    # Allow connection to any node. Adjust these labels to match only nodes
    # your Ansible jobs need to access.
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
---
kind: bot
version: v1
metadata:
  # name is a unique identifier for the Bot in the cluster.
  name: awx-bot
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles to grant to the Bot. This includes the role above,
  # but you can add any additional roles needed to grants the bot SSH access to
  # all the nodes you want to access via your Ansible jobs.
  roles: [example-role]
---
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: awx-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name should match the name of the bot resource above
  bot_name: awx-bot
  join_method: kubernetes
  kubernetes:
    # static_jwks configures the Auth Service to validate the JWT presented by
    # `tbot` using the public key from a statically configured JWKS.
    type: static_jwks
    static_jwks:
      jwks: |
        # Replace this section (including this comment) with the JWKS keys you
        # retrieved above.
        {"keys":[--snip--]}
    # allow specifies the rules by which the Auth Service determines if `tbot`
    # should be allowed to join.
    allow:
    - service_account: "<Var name="awx" />:default" # namespace:service_account
```

Be sure to adjust this configuration as needed:
- Adjust the example role's `logins` and `node_labels` fields to limit access to
  just the nodes and logins needed to run your Ansible jobs.
- Grant any additional desired roles to the bot by appending them to the
  `spec.roles` list in the bot definition.
- Replace the token's `spec.kubernetes.static_jwks.jwks` field value with the
  JWKS keys you retrieved above.
- Adjust the token's `spec.kubernetes.allow` entry or entries as needed to match
  the namespace(s) and service account under which your AWX jobs will run.

Once ready, run the following command to create the resources on your Teleport
cluster:
```code
$ tctl create -f awx-bot-resources.yaml
```

## Step 2/5. Configure Kubernetes resources

Next, we'll prepare a `ConfigMap` resource in the Kubernetes cluster in which
your AWX jobs will run. This `ConfigMap` will contain the configuration for
Machine ID's `tbot` client, in particular:
- The address of your Teleport cluster
- How to join your Teleport cluster, using the join token you created in the
  previous step
- Where the bot should store its internal data (in memory, since AWX jobs are
  ephemeral)
- Which additional services the bot should run, in this case an
  `ssh-multiplexer` to provide efficient access to SSH nodes

The only Kubernetes resource we'll need to configure
manually is a `ConfigMap` for Machine ID's `tbot` client.

Write the following to `configmap-tbot-awx-config.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tbot-awx-config
  namespace: <Var name="awx" />
data:
  tbot.yaml: |
    version: v2
    onboarding:
      join_method: kubernetes
      # ensure token is set to the name of the join token you created earlier
      token: awx-bot
    storage:
      # a memory destination is used for the bots own state since the kubernetes
      # join method does not require persistence.
      type: memory
    # ensure this is configured to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
    proxy_server: <Var name="example.teleport.sh" />:443
    services:
    # The `ssh-multiplexer` service provides a high-performance multiplexer
    # socket for use in Ansible jobs.
    - type: ssh-multiplexer
      # This path (/tbot/) must match the volume mount for the `tbot-binaries`
      # shared volume.
      proxy_command: ["/tbot/fdpass-teleport"]
      destination:
        type: directory
        # The path in the pod where credentials and the multiplexer socket will
        # be created. This must match the volume mounts for both the worker and
        # tbot containers.
        path: "/tbot-output"
```

For more information on the possible values in this config file, see Machine
ID's [configuration reference](../../../reference/machine-workload-identity/machine-id/configuration.mdx).

<Admonition type="info" title="About the ssh-multiplexer">
Machine ID's `ssh-multiplexer` service is used to improve performance when
opening many SSH connections. It provides a Unix socket which the
`fdpass-teleport` executable can use to open new SSH sessions over a single,
shared connection to Teleport. The SSH config written to
`/tbot-output/ssh_config` will be automatically configured to do this.

See the [reference page](../../../reference/machine-workload-identity/machine-id/configuration.mdx#ssh-multiplexer)
to learn more about the `ssh-multiplexer` service.
</Admonition>

Note that this `ConfigMap` resource may need to be adjusted to match your
environment. Here we assume that AWX jobs will run in the namespace
<Var name="awx" /> and that credentials should be fetched from the Teleport
cluster at <Var name="example.teleport.sh" />. Once ready, create the resource:

```code
$ kubectl create -f configmap-tbot-awx-config.yaml
```

Note that we use the default service namespace service account, matching the
default AWX container group template that you'll configure below. If you prefer
to create a custom service account, refer to our generic [Kubernetes
guide](../deployment/kubernetes.mdx) for an example of the Kubernetes RBAC
resources you'll need to create, and the adjustments you'll need to make to the
Teleport token to allow that account to join.

## Step 3/5. Create a new container group

### Summary of pod spec changes

This section describes only one possible way to access resources in Teleport
from a workflow run from Ansible AWX and you will likely need to adapt the steps
described here to suit your environment.

Here's a quick summary of the changes we'll make to the default pod spec in this
guide, and what alternatives you might consider when implementing this yourself:

1. `tbot` and `fdpass-teleport` binaries must be made available to your
   execution environment. We'll use a Teleport `initContainer` to copy these
   binaries into an arbitrary execution environment (like `awx-ee`), but if you
   build your own EE, you can instead install these Teleport binaries into your
   EE directly and will not need to use an `initContainer`.
2. A `tbot` sidecar is added to connect to Teleport, fetch and update SSH
   credentials, and provide an `ssh-multiplexer` socket to enable efficient SSH
   connections to your SSH hosts managed by Teleport.
3. Four additional volumes are be added to the pod spec:
   1. A projected service account token (`join-sa-token`), used for [Kubernetes
      joining](../deployment/kubernetes.mdx)
   2. An `emptyDir` volume (`tbot-binaries`) to contain Teleport binaries
   3. An `emptyDir` volume (`tbot-output`) to contain generated Teleport SSH
      credentials
   4. A `configMap` volume (`tbot-config`) to contain a YAML configuration used
      for the `tbot` sidecar
4. Several volume mounts are added:
   1. The `tbot-binaries` volume is mounted to both the "tbot-installer"
      `initContainer` and the `awx-ee` worker container so your Ansible job can
      execute the binaries at runtime
   2. The `tbot-output` volume is mounted to both the `awx-ee` worker container
      and the `tbot` sidecar `tbot` can share its generated credentials with
      your Ansible job at runtime
   3. The `tbot-config` and `join-sa-token` volumes are mounted to only the
      `tbot` sidecar

### Configuring AWX

Next, we'll need to create a new container instance group that spawns jobs in
Kubernetes (or OpenShift). We'll additionally customize the pod specification to
run Machine ID's `tbot` client as a sidecar alongside the `awx-ee` worker
container to provide SSH credentials to your jobs.

In the AWX web UI, navigate to Administration, Instance Groups, select the "Add"
button, and select "Add container group". Enter any name you like, and set the
fields as desired for your environment.

<Admonition type="note" title="AWX version">
Note that this custom pod specification was written for Ansible AWX version
24.6.1. If using a different version, or if your environment requires additional
pod spec changes, you should carefully review the example pod spec shown below
and make any necessary adjustments.
</Admonition>

Next, select the "Customize pod specification" checkbox. A text field will
appear, containing a default pod spec. Replace it with the following:

{/* TODO: update init container when `tbot copy-binaries` is available */}

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: <Var name="awx" />
spec:
  serviceAccountName: default
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  initContainers:
    - name: tbot-installer
      image: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug:(=teleport.version=)
      command: ["/busybox/busybox"]
      args: ["cp", "/usr/local/bin/tbot", "/usr/local/bin/fdpass-teleport", "/tbot"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: tbot-binaries
          mountPath: /tbot
  containers:
    - image: quay.io/ansible/awx-ee:latest
      name: worker
      args:
        - ansible-runner
        - worker
        - '--private-data-dir=/runner'
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 250m
          memory: 100Mi
      volumeMounts:
        - name: tbot-binaries
          mountPath: /tbot
        - name: tbot-output
          mountPath: /tbot-output
    - name: tbot
      image: public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-distroless-debug:(=teleport.version=)
      command: ["/usr/local/bin/tbot"]
      args:
        - start
        - -c
        - /config/tbot.yaml
      env:
        - name: POD_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
        - name: KUBERNETES_TOKEN_PATH
          value: /var/run/secrets/tokens/join-sa-token
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /config
          name: tbot-config
        - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
          name: join-sa-token
        - mountPath: /tbot-output
          name: tbot-output
      # Configure security context to match awx-ee
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
        runAsGroup: 0
  volumes:
    - name: tbot-binaries
      emptyDir: {}
    - name: tbot-output
      emptyDir: {}
    - name: tbot-config
      configMap:
        name: tbot-awx-config
    - name: join-sa-token
      projected:
        sources:
          - serviceAccountToken:
              path: join-sa-token
              expirationSeconds: 600
              audience: <Var name="example.teleport.sh" />
```

Additional changes may be needed for your environment, but make certain
to adjust at least these fields:
- The top-level `metadata.namespace` field should match the namespace in which
  AWX spawns pods for this instance group.
- The `audience` field of the `join-sa-token` volume should be set to your
  Teleport cluster name.
- The configured `serviceAccountName` should be adjusted if you opt to use a
  service account other than `default`.

Once all necessary modifications have been made, select "Save" to finish
configuring the new container group.

## Step 4/5. Define an inventory

In this step we'll create a trivial inventory containing a Teleport SSH host to
demonstrate how to connect to them in AWX.

In the Ansible AWX web interface, create an inventory containing nodes
accessible via Teleport. To do so, navigate to Resources, Inventories, select
the "Add" button, then select "Add inventory".

Configure the name and other fields as desired, then save the new inventory.
From the new inventory's details page, navigate to the Hosts tab, and select
"Add" to add a new host to the inventory.

Node names follow the same rules as traditional [server
access](./ssh.mdx#connecting-using-openssh). For example, if your Teleport
cluster name is `example.teleport.sh` and you have a node named `foo`, you
would add `foo.example.teleport.sh`. Add one or more nodes and continue on to
the next step.

Note that for future expansion, you can compose inventories using any of the
usual Ansible AWX tools, including smart and constructed inventories.

## Step 5/5. Use the credentials in your Ansible playbook

Once `tbot` is successfully able to provide credentials to your AWX jobs, you
can adjust your playbook to make use of the credentials.

{/* TODO: consider remove this once fix for gravitational/teleport#59066 is
released; troubleshooting entry can stay to help users on older versions. */}

First, create an `ansible.cfg` to disable OpenSSH's built-in multiplexer:

```ini
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPersist=no
```

As we've configured `tbot` to use its built-in `ssh-multiplexer` service,
connections will still be multiplexed - by Teleport instead of OpenSSH - and
performance should be equivalent.

Next, start with this simple `hello_world.yml` playbook example:

```yaml
- name: Hello World Sample
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  pre_tasks:
    - name: Wait for Teleport ssh_config to become available # noqa: run-once[task] (best effort)
      delegate_to: localhost
      run_once: true
      ansible.builtin.wait_for:
        path: /tbot-output/ssh_config
        state: present
        timeout: 120

    - name: Configure SSH via Teleport
      ansible.builtin.set_fact:
        ansible_ssh_common_args: "-F /tbot-output/ssh_config"

  tasks:
    # We have to disable gather_facts at the start because we can't expect to
    # have SSH access until Teleport's ssh_config is ready. Now that it is, we
    # can run the module explicitly.
    - name: Gather facts
      ansible.builtin.setup:

    - name: "Print node hostname"
      ansible.builtin.command: "hostname"
      changed_when: false
```

This example takes a few steps to ensure it can reliably access hosts via the
Teleport Proxy:
- The initial `gather_facts` is disabled as we can't depend on the SSH proxy
  being ready immediately at startup
- A `wait_for` task waits for `tbot`'s generated `ssh_config` to be written to
  disk, signalling it is ready to accept SSH connection requests
- Once ready, `ansible_ssh_common_args` is set to point to the generated
  `ssh_config` and the playbook is allowed to continue
- `ansible.builtin.setup` is run manually to gather facts, which was initially
  skipped

You may want to tweak the exact steps taken here to better suit your environment
and your playbooks. For example, you may want to specify
`ansible_ssh_common_args` at the inventory level to reuse playbooks with
non-Teleport SSH hosts. In this case, make sure your playbooks still check to
make certain the Teleport `ssh_config` is ready for use before trying to connect
to hosts.

Once ready, do the following to run the playbook using the new `tbot`-enabled
container group in an AWX job:
1. Commit these two files to a Git repository
2. Create a new project pointing to it in your AWX dashboard and ensure it is
   synced to your Git repository.
3. Create a new job template and configure the following values:
   - Select the inventory you created in step 4 using the selection dialog
   - Select the project you just created in the selection dialog
   - Select the `hello_world.yml` playbook from the drop-down
   - Select the instance group you created in step 3 in the selection dialog
   - To see node hostname output, select verbosity level "1 (Verbose)" from the
     drop-down
4. Perform any additional customizations you might need, depending on your
   environment

Once finished, save the new job template. On the resulting details page, select
"Launch" to run the job. If successful, you should see a successful job run. If
verbose logging was enabled, you should see `"stdout": "$hostname"` in the log
output for each inventory node.

## Troubleshooting

### Ansible fails to connect to Teleport hosts with an error like: "Shared connection to foo.example.teleport.sh closed."

This is caused by [a Teleport
bug](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/59066) with a pending fix.
The simplest workaround is to disable OpenSSH's built-in multiplexing via
an `ansible.cfg` in your project containing the following:

```ini
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=no -o ControlPersist=no
```

We've configured the `tbot` client to provide its own multiplexer (via the
`ssh-multiplexer` service), so performance should be equivalent.

## Next Steps
