title: Machine ID with Application Access
description: How to use Machine ID to access applications
---

Teleport protects and controls access to HTTP and TCP applications. Machine ID
can be used to grant machines secure, short-lived access to these applications.

In this guide, you will configure `tbot` to produce credentials that can be
used to access an application enrolled in your Teleport cluster.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- If you have not already connected your application to Teleport, follow
  [Protect a Web Application with Teleport](../../../enroll-resources/application-access/getting-started.mdx).
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- `tbot` must already be installed and configured on the machine that will
  access applications. For more information, see the
  [deployment guides](../deployment/deployment.mdx).

## Step 1/3. Configure RBAC

First, Teleport should be configured to allow the credentials produced by `tbot`
to be used to connect to an Application. This is done by creating a role that
grants the necessary permissions and then assigning this role to a Bot.

Create a file called `role.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  allow:
    # Grants access to all applications.
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

Replace `example-role` with a descriptive name related to your use case.

This grants access to all applications. In production environments you should
modify these labels to grant access to only the applications that the machine
will need access to.

Use `tctl create -f ./role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and `example-role`
with the name of the role you just created:

```code
$ tctl bots update example --add-roles example-role
```

## Step 2/3. Configure `tbot`

There are two implementation options available when using `tbot` to grant
a client access to an application. The option you choose will depend on your
specific needs.

The first option is the `application-tunnel` service. This operates a local
proxy that your client can connect to. The service will automatically attach
the credentials to the connection, meaning that the client does not need to
support client certificates. However, this does mean that the `tbot` process
must be running for the client to access the application.

The second option is the `application` output. This will write TLS credentials
to a destination where your client will read them from. The client must support
client certificates and reloading them from disk when they are renewed. In
addition, this option is not compatible with a TLS-terminating load-balancer
between the client and the Teleport Proxy service. Unlike the
`application-tunnel`, the `tbot` process does not need to be running for the
client to access the application - this can be ideal for CI/CD pipelines.

If you aren't sure which to use, we recommend starting with the
`application-tunnel` service as this is compatible with more clients.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="application-tunnel service">
To configure the `application-tunnel` service, first determine where you want
the listener to bind to. As any client that can connect to the service listener
will be able to access the application, it is recommended to bind to the
loopback interface (e.g `127.0.0.1`) as this will prevent access from other
hosts.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `application-tunnel` service:

```yaml
services:
- type: application-tunnel
  app_name: dumper
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:1234
```

Replace:
- `dumper` with the name of the application you registered in Teleport.
- `listen` with the address and port you wish the service to bind to.

Restart `tbot` to apply the new configuration.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="application output">
Outputs must be configured with a destination. In this example, the `directory`
destination will be used. This will write artifacts to a specified directory on
disk. Ensure that this directory can be written to by the Linux user that
`tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by the Linux user that will be accessing
applications.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `application` output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: application
  # specify the name of the application you wish the credentials to grant
  # access to.
  app_name: dumper
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

Ensure you replace `dumper` with the name of the application you registered in
Teleport.

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, it must be executed before you attempt to use the credentials.

## Step 3/3. Connect to your web application with the Machine ID identity

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="application-tunnel service">
Once the `application-tunnel` service has been configured, you can connect to
the application using the listen address you specified.

For example, to access the application using `curl`:

```code
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:1234/
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="application output">
Once `tbot` has been run, credentials will be output to the directory specified
in the destination. Using the example of `/opt/machine-id`:

- `/opt/machine-id/tlscert`: the client TLS certificate
- `/opt/machine-id/key`: the TLS certificate's private key

You may use these credentials with any client application that supports them.

The Teleport Proxy makes apps available via subdomains of its public web
address. Given the debug application named `dumper` and a Teleport Proxy at
`https://example.teleport.sh:443`, the app may be accessed at
`https://dumper.example.teleport.sh:443`.

For example, to access the application using `curl`:

```code
$ curl \
--cert /opt/machine-id/tlscert \
--key /opt/machine-id/key \
https://dumper.example.teleport.sh/
```

No CA certificate needs to be specified so long as your Teleport Proxy is
configured with a valid wildcard CA from Let's Encrypt or another public
certificate authority.

Note that if the certificates are invalid or otherwise misconfigured, clients
will be redirected to the Teleport login page when attempting to access the app.

## Troubleshooting

### Client application requires certificates with standard extensions

If your automated service requires TLS certificates with a specific file
extension, you may also enable the `specific_tls_naming` option for the output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: application
  destination:
    type: directory
    path: /opt/machine-id
  app_name: grafana-example
  specific_tls_naming: true
```

This will generate `tls.crt` and `tls.key` inside `/opt/machine-id`
with identical content to the certificate files listed above.

### Clients are redirected to the Teleport login page

As with human users, scripted clients will be redirected to the Teleport login
page when attempting to access an app through the Teleport Proxy Service without valid
credentials.

Ensure the bot's certificates have not expired and that the client application
has been configured to use both the client certificate and key.

## Next steps

- Review the [Access Controls Reference](../../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx)
  to learn about restricting which Applications and other Teleport resources
  your bot may access.
- Configure [JWTs](../../../enroll-resources/application-access/jwt/introduction.mdx) for your
  Application to remove the need for additional login credentials.
- Read the [configuration reference](../../../reference/machine-id/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available configuration options.
