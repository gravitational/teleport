Machine & Workload Identity can work together to create a comprehensive security model. Machines can securely access resources while workloads communicate securely with each other and external services, 
all managed through Teleport's unified access plane.

## CI/CD pipeline with end-to-end authentication

A [CI/CD system](../mwi-use-cases/mwi-ci-cd.mdx) securely deploys services to Kubernetes and establishes secure communication channels between them:

- The pipeline authenticates through the proxy to deploy to Kubernetes and receives credentials to interact with cloud APIs (e.g., to push container images)
- Services deployed by the pipeline receive SPIFFE identities for mutual TLS. The pipeline manages the identity lifecycle for the services it deploys

## Cloud-native application with third-party API access

A Kubernetes-based application needs access to both internal services and external APIs:

- Automation tools authenticate to configure the cluster securely
- Application components are issued SPIFFE identities
- Identities authenticate to internal services via mTLS
- JWT-based authentication is used for external API access

## Zero Trust security implementation

A [Zero Trust strategy](../workload-identity/getting-started.mdx) is applied across workloads and automation:

- Automation scripts authenticate through the proxy to perform infrastructure tasks
- Workloads authenticate using short-lived, cryptographically verifiable identities
- Security teams use Teleport’s unified audit logs to trace all identity activity

## Identity-based communication without shared secrets

Zero-trust, identity-based communication without shared secrets are rotated automatically without human involvement.

Instead of managing static credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords), workloads authenticate using short-lived X.509 certificates or JWTs compatible with the SPIFFE/SPIRE standard.

- The service issues new identities to workloads on a regular schedule, dynamically issued by Teleport’s Auth Service and rotate automatically
- All identity issuance and usage is recorded in audit logs
