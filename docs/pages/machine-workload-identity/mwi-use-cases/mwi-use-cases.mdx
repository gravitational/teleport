Machine & Workload Identity can work together to create a comprehensive security model. Machines can securely access resources while workloads communicate securely with each other and external services, 
all managed through Teleport's infrastructure identity platform.

## CI/CD pipeline with end-to-end authentication

A [CI/CD system](../mwi-use-cases/mwi-ci-cd.mdx) securely deploys services to Kubernetes and establishes secure communication channels between them.
The pipeline authenticates through the [Teleport Proxy Service](../../reference/architecture/architecture.mdx#teleport-proxy-service) to deploy to Kubernetes and receives credentials to interact with cloud APIs (e.g., to push container images)

## Cloud-native application with third-party API access

These examples illustrate how Machine & Workload Identity enable secure, scalable API access for cloud-native applications running in Kubernetes:

- **Monitoring and observability exporters**:
  Custom exporters or telemetry agents in the cluster send metrics and traces to platforms like Datadog, New Relic, or Grafana Cloud. Machine & Workload Identity replaces static 
  API keys with short-lived credentials tied to the exporter's identity, improving security and auditability.
- **Data processing pipelines**:
  A Kubernetes-based ETL application pulls data from external sources like AWS S3, processes it, and pushes results to third-party analytics or storage platforms. 
  Each workload uses a SPIFFE identity to authenticate securely via JWT or mTLS, eliminating static credentials.
- **Customer support automation**:
  A Kubernetes-based support app consumes internal service data and interacts with systems like Zendesk or Salesforce. 
  Machine ID uses short-lived certificates to ensure API calls originate only from authorized workloads, enabling fine-grained access control and complete auditability.

## Zero Trust security implementation

A [Zero Trust strategy](../workload-identity/getting-started.mdx) is applied across workloads and automation:

- Automation scripts authenticate through the Teleport Proxy Service to perform infrastructure tasks
- Workloads authenticate using short-lived, cryptographically verifiable identities
- Security teams use Teleport's unified audit logs to trace all identity activity

## Identity-based communication without shared secrets

Zero-trust, identity-based communication without shared secrets are rotated automatically without human involvement.

Instead of managing static credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords), workloads authenticate using short-lived X.509 certificates or JWTs compatible with the SPIFFE/SPIRE standard.

- The service issues new identities to workloads on a regular schedule, dynamically issued by Teleport's Auth Service and rotate automatically
- All identity issuance and usage is recorded in audit logs
