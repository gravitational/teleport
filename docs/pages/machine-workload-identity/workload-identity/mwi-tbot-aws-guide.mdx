Teleport Workload Identity issues short-lived cryptographic identities to workloads, enabling them to securely authenticate and communicate with other workloads or cloud provider APIs.

Teleport Workload Identity issues short-lived cryptographic identities to workloads, enabling them to securely authenticate and communicate with other workloads or cloud provider APIs.

This guide walks you through deploying the Machine & Workload Identity agent `tbot` on an Amazon EC2 instance and setting up Machine and Workload Identity (MWI).
By the end, you'll have a working `tbot` service that issues SPIFFE-compatible credentials to workloads running on your EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- An AWS IAM role that you wish to grant access to your Teleport cluster. This
  role must be granted `sts:GetCallerIdentity`. In this guide, this role will
  be named `teleport-bot-role`.
- An AWS EC2 instance with the IAM role attached that you'll install the MWI agent, `tbot`, onto.

## Step 1/7. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the AWS EC2 instance.**

Install `tbot` on the EC2 instance that will use Machine & Workload Identity.

Download and install the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/8. Create a Bot

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/7. Create a join token

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

Create `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name should match the name of the bot created earlier in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: iam
  # Restrict the AWS account and (optionally) ARN that can use this token.
  # This information can be obtained from running the
  # "aws sts get-caller-identity" command from the CLI.
  allow:
    - aws_account: "111111111111"
      aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/teleport-bot-role/i-*"
```

Replace:

- `111111111111` with the ID of your AWS account.
- `teleport-bot-role` with the name of the AWS IAM role you created and assigned
  to the EC2 instance.
- `example` with the name of the bot you created in the second step.
- `i-*` indicates that any instance with the specified role can use the join
  method. If you wish to restrict this to an individual instance, replace `i-*`
  with the full instance ID.

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 4/7. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the AWS EC2 instance.** Configure `workload-identity-api` service in `tbot`. 
To issue SPIFFE credentials to workloads, `tbot` must expose a Workload API endpoint.
You'll configure this by adding the `workload-identity-api` service to your `tbot` configuration.

First, determine where you wish this socket to be created. In our example,
we'll use `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock`. You may wish to choose a directory
that is only accessible by the processes that will need to connect to the Workload API.

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
# Teleport proxy server address
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
# Onboarding configuration
onboarding:
  join_method: iam
  token: example-bot
# Storage configuration for tbot state
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot
# Services section - configures the workload-identity-api service
services:
  - type: workload-identity-api
    listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
    selector:
      name: example-workload-identity
    attestors:
      systemd:
        enabled: true
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service or
  Auth Service. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy Service instance.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step.

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/daemon.mdx!)

Restart your `tbot` instance to apply the new configuration.

## Step 5/7. Configure Workload Identity

Next, we'll configure Workload Identity on the target resource you just created. 
With your bot configured and connected to Teleport, you can now use it to issue SPIFFE-compatible 
credentials to workloads through Teleport's Workload Identity system.

You'll:

- Create a Workload Identity resource that defines your workload's SPIFFE ID.
- Configure RBAC so your Bot can issue credentials for that identity.
- Update your `tbot` instance to expose a SPIFFE Workload API endpoint that workloads can connect to 
receive SPIFFE SVID-compatible credentials.

Before proceeding, you'll want to determine the SPIFFE ID path that your workload will use. In our example, we'll use `/svc/foo`. 
We provide more guidance on choosing a SPIFFE ID structure in the [Best Practices](../workload-identity/best-practices.mdx) guide.

Create a new file called `workload-identity.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: /svc/foo
```

Replace:

- `example-workload-identity` with a name that describes your use-case.
- `/svc/foo` with the SPIFFE ID path you have decided on issuing.

Use `tctl create ./workload-identity.yaml` to create the Workload Identity.

### Using workload attestation

Instead of hard-coding values in the SPIFFE ID, you can also use 
[workload attestation](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/workload-identity/workload-identity-api-and-workload-attestation.mdx) 
to dynamically populate it based on workload attributes. For example, you can include the name of the `systemd` service requesting the identity.

Add the following to your `tbot.yaml` configuration to enable the `systemd` attestor:

```yaml
services:
  - type: workload-identity-api
    listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
    selector:
      name: example-workload-identity
    attestors:
      systemd:
        enabled: true
```

Then define a workload identity that references the attested service name:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: "/svc/{{workload.systemd.service}}"
```

With this configuration, the SPIFFE ID automatically 
includes the systemd service name, such as `/svc/my-app` for a service named `my-app`.

## Step 6/7. Testing the Workload API with `tbot spiffe-inspect`

Use `tbot spiffe-inspect` to verify that the Workload API endpoint is issuing SPIFFE credentials correctly.
This command connects to the endpoint, requests SVIDs, and prints detailed debug information.

Before configuring your workload to use the Workload API, we recommend using
this command to ensure that the Workload API is behaving as expected.

Use the `spiffe-inspect` command with `--path` to specify the path to the
Workload API socket, replacing `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path you
configured in the previous step:

```code
$ tbot spiffe-inspect --path unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
INFO [TBOT]      Inspecting SPIFFE Workload API Endpoint unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock tbot/spiffe.go:31
INFO [TBOT]      Received X.509 SVID context from Workload API bundles_count:1 svids_count:1 tbot/spiffe.go:46
SVIDS
- spiffe://teleport.example.com/svc/foo
  - Expiry: 2025-03-20 10:55:52 +0000 UTC
Trust Bundles
- teleport.example.com
```
This confirms that workloads can successfully connect to the Workload API and receive SPIFFE-compatible credentials issued by Teleport.

## Step 7/7. Configuring your workload to use the Workload API

Now that you know that the Workload API is behaving as expected, you can configure your workload to use it. 
The exact steps will depend on the workload. In cases where you have used the SPIFFE SDKs, you can configure the`SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` 
environment variable to point to the socket created by `tbot`.

## Next steps

- Read the [configuration reference](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/configuration.mdx) to explore all available configuration options.
- Restrict which SVIDs are issued based on characteristics of the workload using [Workload Attestation](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/workload-identity/workload-identity-api-and-workload-attestation.mdx#workload-attestation).
- Configure [WorkloadIdentity Rules](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/workload-identity/sigstore-attestation.mdx) based on the attributes determined via workload attestation.
