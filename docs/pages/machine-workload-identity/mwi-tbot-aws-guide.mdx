This guide walks you through deploying `tbot` on an Amazon EC2 instance and setting up Machine and Workload Identity (MWI).
By the end, you'll have a working `tbot` service that issues SPIFFE-compatible credentials to workloads running on your EC2 instance.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- An AWS IAM role that you wish to grant access to your Teleport cluster. This
  role must be granted `sts:GetCallerIdentity`. In this guide, this role will
  be named `teleport-bot-role`.
- An AWS EC2 instance with the IAM role attached that you'll install Machine ID onto.

## Step 1/9. Install `tbot`

**This step is completed on the AWS EC2 instance.**

Install `tbot` on the EC2 instance that will use Machine ID.

Download and install the appropriate Teleport package for your platform:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 2/9. Create a Bot

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 3/9. Create a join token

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

Create `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # name will be specified in the `tbot` to use this token
  name: example-bot
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name should match the name of the bot created earlier in this guide.
  bot_name: example
  join_method: iam
  # Restrict the AWS account and (optionally) ARN that can use this token.
  # This information can be obtained from running the
  # "aws sts get-caller-identity" command from the CLI.
  allow:
    - aws_account: "111111111111"
      aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/teleport-bot-role/i-*"
```

Replace:

- `111111111111` with the ID of your AWS account.
- `teleport-bot-role` with the name of the AWS IAM role you created and assigned
  to the EC2 instance.
- `example` with the name of the bot you created in the second step.
- `i-*` indicates that any instance with the specified role can use the join
  method. If you wish to restrict this to an individual instance, replace `i-*`
  with the full instance ID.


Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create bot-token.yaml
```

## Step 4/9. Configure `tbot`

**This step is completed on the AWS EC2 instance.**

Create `/etc/tbot.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2

# Teleport proxy server address
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443

# Onboarding configuration
onboarding:
  join_method: token
  token: example-bot

# Storage configuration for tbot state
storage:
  type: directory
  path: /var/lib/teleport/bot

# Outputs section - specifies the credentials tbot should generate
outputs:
  - type: identity
    destination:
      type: directory
      path: /opt/machine-id/identity

# Services section - configures the workload-identity-api service
services:
  - type: workload-identity-api
    # Path to the socket file that workloads will connect to
    listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
    
    # Specifies which WorkloadIdentity resource will be used to issue credentials
    selector:
      # Replace with the actual name of your Workload Identity resource
      name: example-workload-identity
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service or
  Auth Service. Prefer using the address of a Teleport Proxy Service instance.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the second step.

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/daemon.mdx!)

## Step 5/9. Create a role for tbot

To let Teleport users or services run `tbot`, you need a role that grants the required permissions for authenticating and requesting short-lived certificates.
`tbot` uses a bot token issued by the Auth Service and operates under a bot role that defines what the bot can impersonate (e.g., roles, resources).

Save the following role definition as `tbot-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: tbot
spec:
  allow:
    # Allow tbot to impersonate these roles when issuing certificates.
    impersonate:
      roles: ['workload', 'ci-cd']
    # Allow reading and creating resources required for impersonation and joining.
    rules:
      - resources: ['token']
        verbs: ['create']
      - resources: ['role']
        verbs: ['read']
  options:
    max_session_ttl: 8760h  # 1 year for long-running bots
```   

**Apply the role to your cluster:**

```code
$ tctl create tbot-role.yaml
```

<Admonition type="note">
**Understanding the configuration**

- **impersonate.roles**: This section tells Teleport which roles `tbot` is allowed to act on behalf of when issuing short-lived certificates.
In this example, `['workload', 'ci-cd']` represent two roles that your workloads or CI/CD jobs will use when connecting to Teleport.
When `tbot` requests new credentials, it can impersonate these roles so that the generated certificates inherit their permissions.
You can replace these names with any roles that reflect your organization's use cases, for example, `['database', 'monitoring']`.
- **rules**: These allow tbot to perform basic operations required during impersonation.
- **resources ['token'] with verbs ['create']**: lets `tbot` create temporary join tokens as part of its workflow.
- **resources ['role'] with verbs ['read'**: lets it look up role definitions to ensure it can correctly issue impersonated certificates.
- **max_session_ttl**: Controls how long certificates issued through this role can live before renewal. The example uses one year (8760 hours) 
to accommodate long-running bot instances, though the actual certificates `tbot` issues will still be short-lived.
</Admonition>

**Assign the role to the bot:**

Assign the `tbot` role to the bot created earlier.

```code
$ tctl users update example-bot --set-roles=tbot
```

## Step 6/9. Configure Workload Identity

Next, we'll configure Workload Identity on the target resource you just created. 
With your bot configured and connected to Teleport, you can now use it to issue SPIFFE-compatible 
credentials to workloads through Teleport's Workload Identity system.

You'll:

- Create a Workload Identity resource that defines your workload's SPIFFE ID.
- Configure RBAC so your Bot can issue credentials for that identity.
- Update your `tbot` instance to expose a SPIFFE Workload API endpoint that workloads can connect to 
SPIFFE SVID-compatible credentials.

Before proceeding, you'll want to determine the SPIFFE ID path that your workload will use. In our example, we'll use `/svc/foo`. 
We provide more guidance on choosing a SPIFFE ID structure in the [Best Practices](./workload-identity/best-practices.mdx) guide.

Create a new file called `workload-identity.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: workload_identity
version: v1
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity
  labels:
    example: getting-started
spec:
  spiffe:
    id: /svc/foo
```

Replace:

- `example-workload-identity` with a name that describes your use-case.
- `/svc/foo` with the SPIFFE ID path you have decided on issuing.

Use `tctl create ./workload-identity.yaml` to create the Workload Identity.

You'll need to create a role that will grant access to the Workload Identity
that you have just created. As with other Teleport resources, access is granted
by specifying label matchers on the role that will match the labels on the
resource itself.

In addition to granting access to the resource, you will also need to grant the
ability to read and list the Workload Identity resource type.

Create `workload-identity-issuer-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: example-workload-identity-issuer
spec:
  allow:
    workload_identity_labels:
      example: ["getting-started"]
    rules:
    - resources:
      - workload_identity
      verbs:
      - list
      - read
```

Use `tctl create ./workload-identity-issuer-role.yaml` to create the role.

Now, use `tctl bots update` to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example-bot`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide and
`example-workload-identity-issuer` with the name of the role you just created:

```code
$ tctl bots update example-bot --add-roles example-workload-identity-issuer
```

## Step 7/9. Expose a Workload API endpoint

Configure `workload-identity-api` service in `tbot`. To issue SPIFFE credentials to workloads, `tbot` must expose a Workload API endpoint.
You'll configure this by adding the `workload-identity-api` service to your `tbot` configuration.

First, determine where you wish this socket to be created. In our example,
we'll use `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock`. You may wish to choose a directory
that is only accessible by the processes that will need to connect to the Workload API.

Modify your `tbot` configuration file to include the `workload-identity-api` service:

```yaml
services:
- type: workload-identity-api
  listen: unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
  selector:
    name: example-workload-identity
```

Replace:

- `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path to the socket you wish to create.
- `example-workload-identity` with the name of the Workload Identity resource you created earlier.

Restart your `tbot` instance to apply the new configuration.

## Step 8/9. Testing the Workload API with `tbot spiffe-inspect`

Use `tbot spiffe-inspect` to verify that the Workload API endpoint is issuing SPIFFE credentials correctly.
This command connects to the endpoint, requests SVIDs, and prints detailed debug information.

Before configuring your workload to use the Workload API, we recommend using
this command to ensure that the Workload API is behaving as expected.

Use the `spiffe-inspect` command with `--path` to specify the path to the
Workload API socket, replacing `/opt/machine-id/workload.sock` with the path you
configured in the previous step:

```code
$ tbot spiffe-inspect --path unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock
INFO [TBOT]      Inspecting SPIFFE Workload API Endpoint unix:///opt/machine-id/workload.sock tbot/spiffe.go:31
INFO [TBOT]      Received X.509 SVID context from Workload API bundles_count:1 svids_count:1 tbot/spiffe.go:46
SVIDS
- spiffe://teleport.example.com/svc/foo
  - Expiry: 2025-03-20 10:55:52 +0000 UTC
Trust Bundles
- teleport.example.com
```
This confirms that workloads can successfully connect to the Workload API and receive SPIFFE-compatible credentials issued by Teleport.

## Step 9/9. Configuring your workload to use the Workload API

Now that you know that the Workload API is behaving as expected, you can configure your workload to use it. 
The exact steps will depend on the workload. In cases where you have used the SPIFFE SDKs, you can configure the`SPIFFE_ENDPOINT_SOCKET` 
environment variable to point to the socket created by `tbot`.

## Next steps

- Follow one of the [access guides](../machine-workload-identity/access-guides/access-guides.mdx) to configure `tbot` so that meets your access needs.
- Read the [configuration reference](../reference/machine-workload-identity/configuration.mdx) to explore all available configuration options.
- Restrict which SVIDs are issued based on characteristics of the workload using [Workload Attestation](../reference/machine-workload-identity/workload-identity/workload-identity-api-and-workload-attestation.mdx#workload-attestation).
- Configure [WorkloadIdentity Rules](../reference/machine-workload-identity/workload-identity/sigstore-attestation.mdx) based on the attributes determined via workload attestation.
