Using Workload Identity certificates reduces the risk of credential exfiltration and provides 
engineers with a built-in authentication method for new services. Each certificate is tied to 
the identity of the application itself, rather than relying on a shared certificate infrastructure 
or API key that can be copied or reused. This ensures that authentication and authorization are both 
more secure and reliable.

## Eliminate secrets from your applications

Teleport issues special credentials to applications in the form of x.509 certificates or JWTs, after 
verifying their identity (to get started, see [Introduction to Workload Identity](/machine-workload-identity/workload-identity/introduction.mdx). 
These credentials are automatically rotated every 20 minutes by default. They contain a URI that 
uniquely identifies the application. Applications using the credentials automatically gain mTLS, 
and can verify that a request or response not only comes from a trusted certificate, but from a specific trusted application. 
This makes it possible to guarantee separation of tenants, geographic areas, etc.

## Improve developer efficiency and experience

With Teleport Machine & Workload Identity powering application to application authentication, developers can use 
standardized open-source libraries in their services to request a credential, and not worry about setting up API keys or 
integrating with custom PKI. Teleport Workload Identity credentials follow the SPIFFE standard, making them interoperable 
with a wide ecosystem of libraries and SDKs.
