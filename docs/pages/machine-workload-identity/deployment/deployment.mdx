The first step to set up Machine & Workload Identity is to deploy the `tbot`
agent and join it as a Bot to your Teleport cluster. You can run the `tbot`
binary on a number of platforms, from AWS and GitHub Actions to a generic Linux
server or Kubernetes cluster.

## Choosing a deployment method

There are two considerations to make when determining how to deploy the `tbot`
agent on your infrastructure.

### Your infrastructure

The `tbot` agent runs as a container or on a Linux virtual machine. If you run
`tbot` on GitHub Actions, you can use one of the ready-made [Teleport GitHub
Actions workflows](https://github.com/teleport-actions).

### Join method

The `tbot` agent joins your Teleport cluster by using one of the following
authentication methods:

- **Platform-signed document:** The platform that hosts `tbot`, such as a
  Kubernetes cluster or Amazon EC2 instance, provides a signed identity document
  that Teleport can verify using the platform's certificate authority. This is
  the recommended approach because it avoids the use of shared secrets.

- **Bound keypair token:** Your `tbot` agent generates a public/private keypair
  and the Teleport Auth Service is configured to trust the public key. This
  trust can either be established manually - by an administrator copying the key
  to Teleport - or automatically if a single-use joining secret is provided to
  the `tbot` client.

  Once trusted, the `tbot` agent can use its keypair to prove its long-term
  identity to Teleport and receive a renewable certificate. It authenticates to
  Teleport for as long as the renewable credential remains valid, but can use
  the bound keypair to automatically recover if it ever expires - if allowed to
  do so by your own policy. [Read more about Bound Keypair
  Joining](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/bound-keypair/bound-keypair.mdx).

- **Static join token:** Your Teleport client tool generates a string and stores
  it on the Teleport Auth Service. `tbot` provides this string when it first
  connects to your Teleport cluster, demonstrating to the Auth Service that it
  belongs in the cluster. From then on, `tbot` authenticates to your Teleport
  cluster with a renewable certificate.

## Deployment guides

The guides in this section show you how to deploy the Machine & Workload
Identity agent, `tbot`, and join it to your cluster.

If a specific guide does not exist for your platform, the [Linux
guide](linux.mdx) is compatible with most platforms. For
custom approaches, you can also read the [Machine & Workload Identity Reference](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/machine-workload-identity.mdx)
and [Architecture](../../reference/architecture/machine-id-architecture.mdx) to plan your deployment.
