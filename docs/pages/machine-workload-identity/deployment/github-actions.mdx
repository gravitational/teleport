GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that works as a part of the larger
GitHub ecosystem. Teleport Machine & Workload Identity allows GitHub Actions to
securely interact with Teleport protected resources without the need for
long-lived credentials.

Teleport supports secure joining on both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted GitHub
Actions runners as well as GitHub Enterprise Server.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- Your user should have the privileges to create token resources.
- A GitHub repository with GitHub Actions enabled. This guide uses the example
  `gravitational/example` repo, however this value should be replaced with
  your own unique repo.

## Step 1/3. Create a Bot

(!docs/pages/includes/machine-id/create-a-bot.mdx!)

## Step 2/3. Create a join token for GitHub Actions

In order to allow your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with your
Teleport cluster, you'll first need to create a join token. These tokens set out
criteria by which the Auth Service decides whether to allow a bot or node
to join.

In this example, you will create a join token that grants access to any
GitHub Actions run within a specific GitHub repository. In production, you may
wish to further restrict these rules to ensure that access can only occur
when CI is running against a specific branch. You can find a full list of the
available rules on the
[join token reference page.](../../reference/deployment/join-methods.mdx#github-actions-github)

Create a file named `bot-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: example-bot
spec:
  # The Bot role indicates that this token grants access to a bot user, rather
  # than allowing a node to join. This role is built in to Teleport.
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: github
  # The bot_name indicates which bot user this token grants access to. This
  # should match the name of the bot that you created in the previous step.
  bot_name: example
  github:
    # allow specifies rules that control which GitHub Actions runs will be
    # granted access. Those not matching any allow rule will be denied.
    allow:
    # repository should include the name of the owner of the repository.
    - repository: gravitational/example
```

Replace `gravitational/example` with the name of the repository that `tbot`
will run within. You may also choose to change the name of the bot and token
to more accurately describe your use-case.

<Admonition type="note" title="Using GitHub Enterprise?">
**Enterprise Server**

If you are using self-hosted Teleport Enterprise you are able to permit
workflows within GitHub Enterprise Server instances to authenticate using the
GitHub join method.

The Teleport Auth Service must be able to connect to the GitHub Enterprise
Server.

To configure this, set `spec.github.enterprise_server_host` to the hostname of
the GHES instance.

For example:
```yaml
spec:
  github:
    enterprise_server_host: ghes.example.com
```

**Enterprise Cloud**

If you have enabled `include_enterprise_slug` in your GitHub Enterprise
Cloud configuration, you will need to set `spec.github.enterprise_slug` to
the slug of your GitHub Enterprise organization.

For example:
```yaml
spec:
  github:
    enterprise_slug: my-enterprise
```

Read more about `include_enterprise_slug` on the GitHub guide to
[customizing the issuer value for an enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#customizing-the-issuer-value-for-an-enterprise).
</Admonition>

Once the resource file has been written, create the token with `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create -f bot-token.yaml
```

Check that token `example-bot` has been created with the following
command:

```code
$ tctl tokens ls
Token       Type Labels Expiry Time (UTC)
----------- ---- ------ ----------------------------------------------
example-bot Bot         01 Jan 00 00:00 UTC (2562047h47m16.854775807s)
```

## Step 3/3. Configure a GitHub Actions Workflow

Now that the bot has been successfully created, you now need to configure your
GitHub Action's workflow to authenticate as this bot and then use the
credentials produced by `tbot`. To help with this, Teleport publishes
several easy-to-use GitHub Actions that can be used within your workflow.

It is also possible to manually configure `tbot` rather than using one of the
Teleport GitHub Actions. This involves more configuration but allows for
precise control of `tbot` and allows for implementations that are not possible
with the actions.

What follows is examples demonstrating two of the GitHub Actions available as
well as showing how to manually configure `tbot` for use with GitHub Actions.

### Example: `teleport-actions/auth`

The `teleport-actions/auth` action generates a versatile identity output that
can be used for SSH and for administrative actions against a Teleport cluster.
Environment variables are configured by this action and these automatically
configure `tsh` and `tctl` to use this identity.

<Admonition type="info" title="Guided integration available">
    You can use the GitHub Action + SSH integration guide via the
    Teleport Web UI?

    The guide walks you through connecting your GitHub Actions
    workflow to Teleport and giving it the permissions it needs to access your
    enrolled SSH nodes.

    Find the guide in the Web UI:<br />
    **Add New** > **Integration** > **MWI: GitHub Actions + SSH**
</Admonition>

This example shows using the credentials to:

- List the SSH nodes available using `tsh`
- List the SSH nodes available using `tctl`
- Connect to an SSH node using `tsh`
- Connect to an SSH node using OpenSSH's `ssh`

First, you'll need to adjust the role you assigned to the bot to grant it access
to SSH. This example grants access to root on all nodes. In a production setup,
it would be a good idea to restrict this to only the nodes that the bot would
need.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    # Allow login to the Linux user 'root'.
    logins: ['root']
    # Allow connection to any node. Adjust these labels to match only nodes
    # that ansible needs to access.
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

With that privileges granted, you can now create the GitHub Actions workflow.
Create `.github/workflows/example.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to
      # authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    # The name of the workflow, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the
    # required steps.
    name: example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: auto
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
    - name: Fetch credentials using Machine & Workload Identity
      id: auth
      uses: teleport-actions/auth@v2
      with:
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
        # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
        token: example-bot
        # Specify the length of time that the generated credentials should be
        # valid for. This is optional and defaults to "1h"
        certificate-ttl: 1h
        # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This
        # helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this
        # by omitting this.
        anonymous-telemetry: 1
    - name: List nodes (tsh)
      # Enters a command from the cluster, in this case "tsh ls" using Machine
      # ID credentials to list remote SSH nodes.
      run: tsh ls
    - name: List nodes (tctl)
      run: tctl nodes ls
    - name: Run hostname via SSH (tsh)
      # Ensure that `root` matches the username of a remote SSH username, and
      # that hostname matches an SSH host name that is a part of the Teleport
      # cluster configured for access.
      run: tsh ssh root@example-node hostname
    - name: Run hostname via SSH (OpenSSH)
      run: ssh -F ${{ steps.auth.outputs.ssh-config }} root@example-node.example.teleport.sh hostname
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy or cloud
  tenant.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in a previous step.
- `example-node` with the name of a Teleport SSH node that you wish to connect
  to.
- `root` with the name of a user on the node that you are connecting to and that
  you have granted the bot access to.

Add, commit, and push your changes to the `main` branch of the repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `example` job. The GitHub Actions workflow may take some time
to complete, and will resemble the following once successful.

![GitHub Actions](../../../img/machine-id/github-actions.png)

Expand the **List nodes** step of the action, and the output will
list all nodes in the cluster, from the perspective of the
Machine & Workload Identity bot using the command `tsh ls`.

### Example: `teleport-actions/auth-k8s`

The `teleport-actions/auth-k8s` action generates a Kubernetes output service that
contains the necessary credentials and config for a Kubernetes client to connect
to a Kubernetes cluster enrolled in Teleport. The action emits the necessary
environment variable to automatically configure these clients.

In this example, the `teleport-actions/auth-k8s` action will be used to list
all the pods contained within the cluster, but this could just as easily be
modified to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster with `kubectl` or `helm`.

<Admonition type="info" title="Guided integration available">
    You can use the GitHub Action + Kubernetes integration guide via the
    Teleport Web UI?

    The guide walks you through connecting your GitHub Actions
    workflow to Teleport and giving it the permissions it needs to access your
    enrolled Kubernetes clusters.

    Find the guide in the Web UI:<br />
    **Add New** > **Integration** > **MWI: GitHub Actions + Kubernetes**
</Admonition>

First, you'll need to adjust the role you assigned to the bot to grant it access
to the Kubernetes cluster. This example will grant the bot access to all
clusters with the group `editor`. For more detailed instructions on setting
up Kubernetes RBAC, see the Kubernetes access guide.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following rule to the Teleport role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    kubernetes_labels:
      '*': '*'
    kubernetes_resources:
    - kind: pod
      namespace: "*"
      name: "*"
    kubernetes_groups:
    - editor
```

<Admonition type="note">
This example assumes the role is version `v6`. If you are using a `v7`+ role
you will need to include `verbs: ["get", "list"]` for the `kind: pod` section
in `kubernetes_resources`. Otherwise the example `kubectl get pods -A` execution
will be denied.
</Admonition>

With that privileges granted, you can now create the GitHub Actions workflow.
Create `.github/workflows/example.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started, modify it for your needs.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to
      # authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    name: example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch kubectl
      uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: auto
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
    - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
      uses: teleport-actions/auth-k8s@v2
      with:
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
        # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
        token: example-bot
        # Use the name of your Kubernetes cluster
        kubernetes-cluster: my-kubernetes-cluster
        # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This helps us
        # shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
        # omitting this.
        anonymous-telemetry: 1
    - name: List pods
      run: kubectl get pods -A
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in a previous step.
- `my-kubernetes-cluster` with the name of your Kubernetes cluster.

The `auth-k8s` action sets the `KUBECONFIG` for future steps to the credentials
it has fetched from Teleport. This means that most existing tooling for
Kubernetes (e.g `kubectl` and `helm`) can use your cluster with no additional
configuration.

Add, commit, and push this new workflow file to the default branch of your
repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `example` job.

Expand the **List pods** step of the action, where you can then confirm that the
output shows a list of all the pods within your Kubernetes cluster.

### Example: `teleport-actions/database-tunnel`

<Admonition type="warning" title="Required version">
  This requires use of version 18.6.4 or later of the `tbot` client.
</Admonition>

The `teleport-actions/database-tunnel` action runs a background `tbot` client
that provides a tunnel to a database protected by Teleport using Machine &
Workload ID's [`database-tunnel` service](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/configuration.mdx#database-tunnel).

In this example, the `psql` client will be used to run a simple query on a
Postgres database, but you may use any supported database type with any
compatible client. Refer to our [generic database guide](../access-guides/databases.mdx)
for more information on accessing databases protected by Teleport in your apps.

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    # TODO: database rules
```

With that privileges granted, you can now create the GitHub Actions workflow.
Create `.github/workflows/example.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started, modify it for your needs.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to
      # authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    name: example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: auto
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
    - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
      uses: teleport-actions/database-tunnel@v1
      with:
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
        # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
        token: example-bot
        # Configure the listener address for the tunnel. Your native database
        # client (e.g. `psql`) will connect using this socket address.
        listen: tcp://localhost:5432
        # The database service name, usually the name of the database server as
        # shown in `tsh db ls`
        service: postgres
        # The name of the specific database to connect to.
        database: demo
        # The username of the database user to connect as.
        username: demo
        # Configure the port for tbot's diagnostics service, used to coordinate
        # with the bot in the background. If running multiple background bots
        # (app tunnel/proxy, database tunnel, etc), make sure to give each a
        # unique port. If unset, the default shown below is used.
        diagPort: 57263
        # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This helps us
        # shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
        # omitting this.
        anonymous-telemetry: 1

    - name: Run a database command
      run: |
        psql postgres://demo@localhost:5432/demo -c 'select 1;'
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in a previous step.
- `service` with the name of your database server as configured in Teleport.
- `database` with the database name to access.
- `username` with the database username to connect as.

Once the `teleport-actions/database-tunnel` action completes, a database tunnel
will be running at the configured port (in this case, `localhost:5432`). You may
then access that using `psql` or any other compatible client, depending on your
database.

Add, commit, and push this new workflow file to the default branch of your
repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `example` job.

Expand the **Run a database command** step of the action, where you can then
confirm that the database command was run successfully.

### Example: `teleport-actions/application-tunnel`

<Admonition type="warning" title="Required version">
  This requires use of version 18.6.4 or later of the `tbot` client.
</Admonition>

The `teleport-actions/application-tunnel` action runs a background `tbot` client
that provides a tunnel to an HTTP or TCP app protected by Teleport using Machine
& Workload ID's [`application-tunnel` service](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/configuration.mdx#application-tunnel).

Use `tctl edit role/example-bot` to add the following to the role:

```yaml
spec:
  allow:
    # TODO: app rules
```

With that privileges granted, you can now create the GitHub Actions workflow.
Create `.github/workflows/example.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started, modify it for your needs.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch kubectl
      uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: auto
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
    - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
      uses: teleport-actions/application-tunnel@v1
      with:
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
        # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
        token: example-bot
        # The name of the app to access.
        app: my-application
        # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This helps us
        # shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
        # omitting this.
        anonymous-telemetry: 1

    - name: Access the app
      run: curl http://localhost:1234
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in a previous step.
- `my-application` with the name of your app as configured in Teleport.

Once run, the `application-tunnel` action opens a tunnel to the selected
application on the configured host and port (in this case, `localhost:1234`).

Add, commit, and push this new workflow file to the default branch of your
repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `example` job.

Expand the **List pods** step of the action, where you can then confirm that the
output shows a list of all the pods within your Kubernetes cluster.

### Example: `teleport-actions/application-proxy`

<Admonition type="warning" title="Required version">
  This requires use of version 18.6.4 or later of the `tbot` client.
</Admonition>

The `teleport-actions/application-proxy` action runs a background `tbot` client
that provides a local HTTP proxy server that can be used to access to arbitrary
HTTP apps protected by Teleport using Machine & Workload ID's [`application-proxy` service](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/configuration.mdx#application-proxy).

While this action only supports HTTP applications, you can access arbitrary apps
so long as your bot has been granted appropriate RBAC permissions, so long as
your client app can use HTTP proxies (e.g. the `$HTTP_PROXY` environment
variable).

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started, modify it for your needs.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to
      # authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    name: example
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: auto
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
    - name: Fetch credentials using Machine ID
      uses: teleport-actions/application-proxy@v1
      with:
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
        # Use the name of the join token resource you created in step 1.
        token: example-bot
        # Configure the listener address for the HTTP proxy server.
        listen: tcp://localhost:1235
        # Configure the port for tbot's diagnostics service, used to coordinate
        # with the bot in the background. If running multiple background bots
        # (app tunnel/proxy, database tunnel, etc), make sure to give each a
        # unique port. If unset, the default shown below is used.
        diagPort: 57263
        # Enable the submission of anonymous usage telemetry. This helps us
        # shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
        # omitting this.
        anonymous-telemetry: 1

    - name: Perform a request over the application tunnel
      run: |
        http_proxy=http://localhost:1235 curl http://httpbin/get
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in a previous step.

No specific app name needs to be configured for the application proxy.

Once the action completes, an HTTP proxy server will be running on the
configured port (in this case, `http://localhost:1235`). Any application that
can use HTTP proxies can then access any app granted to the bot via its role,
at `http://APP_NAME/`.

Add, commit, and push this new workflow file to the default branch of your
repository.

Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository in your web browser.
Select the **Workflow** that has now been created and triggered by the change,
and select the `example` job.

Expand the **Perform a request...** step of the action, where you can then
confirm that the output shows a successful `curl` request via the proxy.

### Example: Manual configuration

To configure `tbot` manually, a YAML file will be used. In this example we'll
commit this to the repository, but this could be generated or created by the
CI pipeline itself.

Note that this example uses `tbot`'s "oneshot" mode to output credentials and
exit immediately. If you need to use a long running background service,
[see below](#example-manual-configuration-with-a-background-service) for a
tailored example.

Create `tbot.yaml` within your repository:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: github
  token: example-bot
oneshot: true
storage:
  type: memory
# services will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
services: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the first step.

Now you can define a GitHub Actions workflow that will start `tbot` with this
configuration.

Create `.github/workflows/example-action.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to
      # authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    # The name of the workflow, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the
    # required steps.
    name: guide-demo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: auto
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
    - name: Execute Machine ID
      env:
        # TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY enables the submission of anonymous
        # usage telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of
        # tbot. You can disable this by omitting this.
        TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY: 1
      run: tbot start -c ./tbot.yaml --oneshot
```

Add, commit, and push these two files to the repository. Check the GitHub
Actions UI to ensure that the workflow has succeeded.

### Example: Manual configuration with a background service

<Admonition type="warning" title="Required version">
  This requires use of version 18.6.4 or later of the `tbot` client.
</Admonition>

If you need to have a `tbot` client running in the background to provide a
service not directly supported by a dedicated action, like the
[`ssh-multiplexer`](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/configuration.mdx#ssh-multiplexer)
or [`workload-identity-api`](../../reference/machine-workload-identity/configuration.mdx#workload-identity-api)
services, or just to continually renew certificates for long-running jobs, it is
possible to safely run `tbot` in the background with some additional steps.

As in the standard manual configuration steps, create `tbot.yaml` within your
repository:

```yaml
version: v2
proxy_server: example.teleport.sh:443
onboarding:
  join_method: github
  token: example-bot
storage:
  type: memory
# services will be filled in during the completion of an access guide.
services: []
```

Replace:

- `example.teleport.sh:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
- `example-bot` with the name of the token you created in the first step.

Now you can define a GitHub Actions workflow that will start `tbot` with this
configuration.

Create `.github/workflows/example-action.yaml`:

```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started.
# It will take the following action whenever a push is made to the "main" branch.
on:
  push:
    branches:
    - main
jobs:
  demo:
    permissions:
      # The "id-token: write" permission is required or tbot will not be able to
      # authenticate with the cluster.
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    # The name of the workflow, and the Linux distro to be used to perform the
    # required steps.
    name: guide-demo
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Fetch Teleport binaries
      uses: teleport-actions/setup@v1
      with:
        version: auto
        # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service.
        proxy: example.teleport.sh:443
    - name: Start tbot in the background
      env:
        # TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY enables the submission of anonymous
        # usage telemetry. This helps us shape the future development of
        # tbot. You can disable this by omitting this.
        TELEPORT_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY: 1
      run: nohup tbot start -c ./tbot.yaml --diag-addr localhost:57264 > ./tbot.log 2>&1 &
    - name: Wait for tbot to become ready
      run: tbot wait --diag-addr localhost:57264

    # Insert other steps that use tbot credentials or services here.

    # At the end of the job, this step prints recorded tbot logs for debugging
    # purposes (stored in tbot.log).
    - name: Print tbot logs
      # Logs should be printed regardless of whether or not other job steps fail.
      if: always()
      run: |
        if [ -f ./tbot.log ]; then
          cat ./tbot.log
        else
          echo "No tbot logs found"
        fi
```

Add, commit, and push these two files to the repository. Check the GitHub
Actions UI to ensure that the workflow has succeeded.

## A note on security implications and risk

Once `teleport-actions/auth` has been used in a workflow job, all successive
steps in that job will have access to the credentials which grant access to your
Teleport cluster as the bot. Where possible, run as few steps as necessary after
this action has been used. It may be a good idea to break your workflow up into
multiple jobs in order to segregate these credentials from other code running in
your CI/CD pipeline.

Most importantly, ensure that the role you assign to your GitHub Actions bot has
access to only the resources in your Teleport cluster that your CI/CD needs to
interact with.
