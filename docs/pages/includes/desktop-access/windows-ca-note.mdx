<Admonition type="note" title="Windows CA">
Teleport v18.7.0 introduced the windows CA for issuance of Windows Desktop
Access certificates. Prior to that the user CA was used.

Clusters updated to v18.7.0 (or newer) automatically clone the user CA to the
windows CA, so existing trust relationships hold true until the windows CA is
rotated.
