  ldap:
    # Address of the LDAP server for secure LDAP connections.
    # Usually, this address will use port 636, like: ldap.example.com:636.
    # For best results, this address should point to a highly-available
    # endpoint (a load balancer, VIP, or round-robin DNS) rather than
    # a single domain controller.
    addr:     '$LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS'
    # Active Directory domain name you are connecting to.
    domain:   '$LDAP_DOMAIN_NAME'
    # LDAP username for authentication. This username must include the domain
    # NetBIOS name. The use of single quotes here is intentional in order to
    # avoid the need to escape the backslash (\) character.
    #
    # For example, if your domain is "example.com", the NetBIOS name for it is
    # likely "EXAMPLE". When connecting as the "svc-teleport" user, you should
    # use the format: "EXAMPLE\svc-teleport".
    username: '$LDAP_USERNAME'
    # You can skip LDAPS certificate verification by setting
    # this to true. It is recommended that this be set to false
    # and the certificate added your system's trusted repository,
    # or its filepath provided in with the der_ca_file variable below.
    insecure_skip_verify: false
    # DER encoded LDAP CA certificate.
    der_ca_file: /path/to/cert
  # (optional) settings for enabling automatic desktop discovery via LDAP
  discovery:
    # The wildcard '*' character tells Teleport to discover all the hosts in
    # the Active Directory Domain. To refine the search, specify a custom DN.
    # To disable automatic discovery, leave this field blank.
    base_dn: '*'
    # (optional) LDAP filters for further customizing the LDAP search.
    # See https://ldap.com/ldap-filters for details on LDAP filter syntax.
