If you are running Teleport on the internet, we recommend using Let's Encrypt to
receive your key and certificate automatically. For private networks or custom
deployments, use your own private key and certificate.
<Tabs>

  <TabItem label="Public internet deployment with Let's Encrypt">
    Let's Encrypt verifies that you control the domain name of your Teleport cluster
    by communicating with the HTTPS server listening on port 443 of your Teleport
    Proxy Service.

    You can configure the Teleport Proxy Service to complete the Let's Encrypt
    verification process when it starts up.

    On the host where you will start the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service,
    run the following `teleport configure` command. Assign 
    <Var name="tele.example.com" /> to the
    domain name of your Teleport cluster and <Var name="user@example.com" /> to
    an email address used for notifications (you can use any domain):

    ```code
    $ sudo teleport configure -o file \
        --acme --acme-email=<Var name="user@example.com" description="Your email address to register with Let's Encrypt for TLS certificates" /> \
        --cluster-name=<Var name="tele.example.com" description="The domain name of your Teleport cluster" />
    ```

    Port 443 on your Teleport Proxy Service host must allow traffic from all sources.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Private network deployment">
  On your Teleport host, place a valid private key and a certificate chain in `/var/lib/teleport/privkey.pem`
  and `/var/lib/teleport/fullchain.pem` respectively.

  The leaf certificate must have a subject that corresponds to the domain of your Teleport host, e.g., `*.teleport.example.com`.

  On the host where you will start the Teleport Auth Service and Proxy Service,
  run the following `teleport configure` command. Assign <Var
  name="tele.example.com" /> to the domain name of your Teleport cluster.

  ```code
  $ sudo teleport configure -o file \
      --cluster-name=<Var name="tele.example.com" /> \
      --public-addr=<Var name="tele.example.com" />:443 \
      --cert-file=/var/lib/teleport/fullchain.pem \
      --key-file=/var/lib/teleport/privkey.pem
  ```
