This guide shows you how to install the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart, which is
intended to help you get started with Teleport by deploying the Auth Service and
Proxy Service in a Kubernetes cluster so you can access that cluster via the
Kubernetes Service.

Since the Auth and Proxy Services are fully managed in Teleport Cloud, you should
install our `teleport-kube-agent` chart, which is intended for deployments where
the Auth Service and Proxy Service run outside your Kubernetes cluster.

You can use the `teleport-kube-agent` chart to enable the Application Service
and Database Service in addition to the Kubernetes Service.

For more information, see our [Helm chart reference](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx).
