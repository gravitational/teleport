Set up the Teleport Helm repository.

Allow Helm to install charts that are hosted in the Teleport Helm repository:

```code
$ helm repo add teleport (=teleport.helm_repo_url=)
```

Update the cache of charts from the remote repository so you can upgrade to all
available releases:

```code
$ helm repo update
```
