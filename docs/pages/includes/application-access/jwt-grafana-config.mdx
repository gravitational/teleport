Add an `auth.jwt` section in Grafana’s main configuration file. Replace <Var
name="teleport.example.com" /> with the domain name of your Teleport cluster:
```ini
[auth.jwt]
enabled = true

# HTTP header to look into to get a JWT token.
header_name = Authorization

# JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URL from your Teleport cluster.
jwk_set_url = https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />/.well-known/jwks.json

# Teleport username can be found in "sub" or "username" claims.
username_claim = sub

# Map Teleport users to Grafana organization roles based on their Teleport
# roles. Adjust accordingly.
#
# In this example, if the user's Teleport role list (the "roles" claim) contains
# "editor", assign them the Grafana "Editor" role. All other users get the
# "Viewer" role.
#
# Teleport user traits are also available in the "traits" claim and can be
# used in expressions in the same way as roles.
role_attribute_path = contains(roles[*], 'editor') && 'Editor' || 'Viewer'

# auto-create users if they are not already matched.
auto_sign_up = true
```

Restart your Grafana instance after updating the config.
