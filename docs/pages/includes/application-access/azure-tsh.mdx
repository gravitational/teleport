Now that you have authorized your Teleport user to assume the `teleport-azure`
identity, you can use Teleport to authenticate to Azure's APIs and execute
commands against it via the `az` CLI.

### List your Azure CLI application

Verify that your Teleport user can see the `azure-cli` application you
registered earlier:

```code
$ tsh apps ls
Application Description Type Public Address                 Labels
----------- ----------- ---- ------------------------------ -------------------
azure-cli               HTTP azure-cli.teleport.example.com teleport.dev/origin
```

### Log in to use an Azure CLI

Log in to the application, specifying that you would like to assume the
`teleport-azure` identity:

```code
$ tsh apps login azure-cli --azure-identity teleport-azure
```

This command validates the value of the `--azure-identity` flag against the ones
the user is authorized to assume. The value of the flag can either be the full
URI of the identity (e.g., the URI you copied earlier in this guide) or the name
of the identity, e.g., `teleport-azure`. 

A user can omit the `--azure-identity` flag if they are only authorized to
access a single Azure identity, but otherwise not including the
`--azure-identity` flag will result in an error.

If the command succeeds, you will see information about the user's chosen Azure
identity similar to the following:

```text
[
  {
    "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Microsoft Azure Sponsorship",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "user": {
      "assignedIdentityInfo": "MSIResource-/subscriptions/0000000000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure",
      "name": "userAssignedIdentity",
      "type": "servicePrincipal"
    }
  }
]

Logged into Azure app "azure-cli".
Your identity: /subscriptions/0000000000000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure
Example Azure CLI command: tsh az vm list
```

### Execute Azure CLI commands

At this point, you can run `az` commands using the Teleport Application Service
by prefixing them with `tsh`. To list VMs running in your Azure resource group,
for example, run the following command:

```code
$ tsh az vm list
```

<Admonition type="tip">

If you're not seeing the expected VMs at this point, double-check that your
Azure managed identity is assigned the "Reader" role at the scope of your
resource group.

</Admonition>

### Use Azure CLI applications without `tsh`

In addition to running `az` commands via `tsh`, you can grant secure access to
any CLI application that executes commands against Azure's APIs.

To do this, use `tsh` to start a local proxy that forwards traffic from your CLI
application to the Teleport Application Service. The Application Service uses an
Azure managed identity to fetch an authentication token from Azure, which your
CLI application uses to authenticate requests to Azure's APIs.

To start the local proxy, run the following `tsh` command:

```code
$ tsh proxy azure 
```

<Admonition type="tip">

The command `tsh proxy az` is an alias for `tsh proxy azure`.

</Admonition>

The command will print the address of the local proxy server along with `export`
commands for assigning environment variables. Azure CLI applications read these
variables in order to request an authentication token for Azure's APIs:

(!docs/pages/includes/application-access/azure-tsh-proxy-azure-sample.mdx!)

<Admonition type="warning">

`tsh proxy azure` runs the local proxy in the foreground, so don't interrupt
the process or exit the terminal where you ran the command until you're ready
to close the local proxy.

</Admonition>

Copy the `export` commands and paste them into a second terminal. In that
terminal, you can now run your Azure CLI application of choice. For example, you
can run the following command to list Azure VMs:

```code
$ az vm list
```

Since the `az` CLI requests an authentication token using the `teleport-azure`
identity you created earlier, and that identity is authorized to view resources
in your resource group, the `az vm list` command will only list VMs in that
resource group.

<Admonition type="info">

When you run an `az` command via `tsh az`, `tsh` starts the local proxy in the
background and uses it to execute the command.
