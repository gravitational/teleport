<Admonition type="tip" title="Not yet a Teleport user?">
If you have not yet deployed the Auth Service and Proxy Service, you should follow one of our [getting started guides](../../enroll-resources/application-access/getting-started.mdx) or try our Teleport application access [interactive learning track](https://goteleport.com/labs/).
</Admonition>

We will assume your Teleport cluster is accessible at `teleport.example.com` and `*.teleport.example.com`. You can substitute the address of your Teleport Proxy Service. (For Teleport Cloud customers, this will be similar to `mytenant.teleport.sh`.)
