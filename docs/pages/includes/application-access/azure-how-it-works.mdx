The Teleport Application Service installed {{ deployment }} uses {{ credential }}
to obtain authentication tokens from Azure. When a user authenticates to
Teleport, they can assume one of the respective user-assigned managed
identities to execute Azure CLI commands.

You can configure which Teleport users or roles have access to specific Azure
identities, giving you control over who can obtain credentials for different
levels of access to Azure CLIs.

The Teleport Application Service connects to the Teleport Proxy Service over a
reverse tunnel, so you can run the Application Service in a private network and
prevent unauthorized access to your organization's Azure identities.
