The next step is to authorize your Teleport user to assume an Azure identity and
execute Azure CLI commands via Teleport. You will protect access to this
identity using Teleport's RBAC system, where a user's roles determine which
Azure managed identities (if any) they can access.

There are two approaches you can take to authorize users to access Azure
identities.

|Approach|Description|Supported User Types|
|---|---|---|
|**Dynamic**|A Teleport role includes a template variable that grants a user access to all Azure identities assigned directly to them.|Local users, OIDC, SAML|
|**Static**|A Teleport role explicitly specifies the Azure identities a user is allowed to assume.|Local users, OIDC, SAML, GitHub|

<Notice type="tip">

We recommend using the dynamic approach, since it scales well as you add
Azure identities to your account. If you have configured a Teleport Community Edition
cluster to authenticate users using GitHub SSO, you must use the static approach,
as OAuth-based GitHub applications do not support custom claims.

Create a file called `azure-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - '{{internal.azure_identities}}'
```

When a user with the `azure-cli-access` role authenticates to an Azure CLI via
Teleport, the Teleport Auth Service populates the
`{{internal.azure_identities}}` template variable with any Azure identities you
have assigned to the user.

Assign the `teleport-azure` identity to your Teleport user by running the
following command, pasting in the URI of the Azure identity you copied earlier
as the value of `--set-azure-identities`:

```code
$ tctl users update <Var name="teleport-user" /> \
--set-azure-identities <Var name="azure-identity-uri" />
```

This command uses the `--set-azure-identities` flag to add Azure identities to a
user. You can assign `--set-azure-identities` to multiple identity URIs,
separated by commas.

The identity URIs are Azure resource IDs in the following format:
```text
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/IDENTITY_NAME
```

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f azure-cli-access.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem options="Dynamic Identities" label="SAML/OIDC Connectors">

In your identity provider, define a custom SAML attribute or OIDC claim called
`azure_identities`. Each user's `azure_identities` attribute or claim must be a
list of Azure identity URIs, using the following format:

```text
/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/IDENTITY_NAME
```

Create a file called `azure-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - '{{external.azure_identities}}'
```

When a user with the `azure-cli-access` role authenticates to an Azure CLI via
Teleport, the Teleport Auth Service populates the
`{{external.azure_identities}}` template variable with any Azure identities you
have assigned to the user.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f azure-cli-access.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem options="Static Identities" label="All Authentication Methods">

Define a role with access to specific Azure identities, which means that
Teleport users who assume this role can use those (and only those) identities to
execute commands via an Azure CLI.

Create a file called `azure-cli-access.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: azure-cli-access
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
    azure_identities:
      - /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/teleport-azure
```

Edit the identity URI in the `azure_identities` field to match the one you
copied in Step 1.

This role grants a user access to any Teleport-registered application, such as
the `azure-cli` application we defined earlier, and allows that user to assume
the `teleport-azure` identity you created earlier.

Create the role:

```code
$ tctl create -f azure-cli-access.yaml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Details title="Denying access to Azure identities">

You can define a Teleport role that denies a user access to one or more Azure
identities. To do so, assign values to the `azure_identities` field within the
`spec.deny` section of a `role` resource. 

For example, this role denies the user access to all Azure identities:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: "no-azure-identities"
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      '*': '*'
  deny:
    azure_identities:
      - '*'
```

The `no-azure-identities` role enables the user to access all registered
applications, but makes use of the wildcard character (`*`) within the
`deny.azure_identities` field to prevent the user from assuming any Azure
identity. 

Unlike values of `allow.azure_identities`, values of `deny.azure_identities` can
include wildcard expressions in addition to the URIs of specific Azure
identities.

The Teleport Auth Service gives `deny` rules precedence over `allow` rules when
evaluating a user's roles.
