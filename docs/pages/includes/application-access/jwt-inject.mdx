You can inject a JWT token into any header using [headers passthrough](../../enroll-resources/application-access/guides/connecting-apps.mdx#headers-passthrough)
configuration and the `{{internal.jwt}}` template variable. This variable will
be replaced with JWT token signed by Teleport JWT CA containing user identity
information like described above.
