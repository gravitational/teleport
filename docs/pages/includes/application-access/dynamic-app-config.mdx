To enable dynamic registration, include a `resources` section in your Application
Service configuration with a list of resource label selectors you'd like this
service to monitor for registering:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: true
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

You can use a wildcard selector to register all dynamic app resources in the cluster
on the Application Service or provide a specific set of labels for a subset:

```yaml
resources:
- labels:
    "env": "prod"
- labels:
    "env": "test"
```
