{{ appType="web application" appScheme="https" }}

By default, Teleport includes a user's roles and traits in the JWT generated for
application access, and the `Teleport-Jwt-Assertion` header is sent along with
every request that Teleport makes to an upstream {{ appType }}.

If your {{ appType }} doesn't care about these values, or you are encountering an
error due to exceeding the size limit of HTTP headers, you can configure
Teleport to omit this information from the token.

```yaml
- name: "dashboard"
  uri: {{ appScheme }}://localhost:4321
  rewrite:
    # Specify whether to include roles or traits in the JWT.
    # Options:
    # - roles-and-traits: include both roles and traits
    # - roles: include only roles
    # - traits: include only traits
    # - none: exclude both roles and traits from the JWT token
    # Default: roles-and-traits
    jwt_claims: roles-and-traits
    headers:
    # Inject header with Teleport-signed JWT token.
    - "Authorization: Bearer {{internal.jwt}}"
```
