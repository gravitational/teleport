In order to interact with dynamically registered applications, a user must have
a Teleport role with permissions to manage `app` resources.

In the following example, a role allows a user to perform all possible
operations against `app` resources:

```yaml
allow:
  rules:
    - resources:
        - app
      verbs: [list, create, read, update, delete]
```
