spec:
  agents:
    # mode allows users to enable, disable, or suspend agent updates at the
    # cluster level. Disable agent automatic updates only if self-managed
    # updates are in place. This value may also be set in autoupdate_version.
    # If set in both places, disabled overrides suspended, which overrides enabled.
    # Possible values: "enabled", "disabled", "suspended"
    # Default: "disabled" (unless specified in autoupdate_version)
    mode: enabled

    # strategy used to roll out updates to agents. Applies to every group.
    # The halt-on-error strategy ensures that groups earlier in the schedule are
    # given the opportunity to update to the target_version before groups that are
    # later in the schedule. (Currently, the schedule must be stopped manually by
    # setting the mode to "suspended" or "disabled". In the future, errors will be
    # detected automatically).
    # The time-based strategy ensure that each group updates within a defined
    # time window, with no dependence between groups.
    # Possible values: "halt-on-error" or "time-based"
    # Default: "halt-on-error"
    strategy: halt-on-error

    # maintenance_window_duration configures the duration after the start_hour
    # when updates may occur. Only valid for the time-based strategy.
    # maintenance_window_duration: 1h

    # schedules define groups of agents with different update times.
    # Currently, only the regular schedule is configurable.
