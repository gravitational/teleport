metadata:
  # autoupdate_agent_rollout is a singleton resource. There can be only one instance
  # of this resource in the Teleport cluster, and it must be named `autoupdate-agent-rollout`.
  name: autoupdate-agent-rollout
spec:
  # start_version is the version used to install new agents before their
  # group's scheduled update time. Agents never update to the start_version
  # automatically, but may be required to via "teleport-update update --now".
  start_version: v17.2.0

  # target_version is the version that agents update to during their group's
  # scheduled update time. New agents also use this version after their group's
  # scheduled update time.
  target_version: v17.2.1

  # schedule used to roll out updates.
  # The regular schedule is defined in the autoupdate_config resource.
  # The immediate schedule updates all agents to target_version immediately.
  # Possible values: "regular" or "immediate"
  schedule: regular

  # autoupdate_mode allows users to enable, disable, or suspend agent updates at the
  # cluster level. Disable agent automatic updates only if self-managed
  # updates are in place. This value may also be set in autoupdate_config.
  # If set in both places, disabled overrides suspended, which overrides enabled.
  # Possible values: "enabled", "disabled", "suspended"
  autoupdate_mode: enabled

  # strategy used to roll out updates to agents.
  # The halt-on-error strategy ensures that groups earlier in the schedule are
  # given the opportunity to update to the target_version before groups that are
  # later in the schedule. (Currently, the schedule must be stopped manually by
  # setting the mode to "suspended" or "disabled". In the future, errors will be
  # detected automatically).
  # The time-based strategy ensure that each group updates within a defined
  # time window, with no dependence between groups.
  # Possible values: "halt-on-error" or "time-based"
  # Default: "halt-on-error"
  strategy: halt-on-error

  # maintenance_window_duration configures the duration after the start_hour
  # when updates may occur. Only valid for the time-based strategy.
  # maintenance_window_duration: 1h
