Teleport uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Version numbers
include a major version, minor version, and patch version, separated by dots.
When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
apply:

- Servers support clients that are one major version behind, but do not support
  clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service
  instance is compatible with 7.x.x agents and 7.x.x `tsh`, but we don't
  guarantee that a 9.x.x agent will work with an 8.x.x Proxy Service instance.
  This also means you must not attempt to upgrade from 6.x.x straight to 8.x.x.
  You must upgrade to 7.x.x first.
- Proxy Service instances and agents do not support Auth Service instances that
  are on an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Service
  instances by default. For example, an 8.x.x Proxy Service or agent is not
  compatible with an 7.x.x Auth Service.
