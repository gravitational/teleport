Teleport uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Version numbers
include a major version, minor version, and patch version, separated by dots.
When running multiple `teleport` binaries within a cluster, the following rules
apply:

- Servers support clients that are one major version behind, but do not support
  clients that are on a newer major version. For example, an 17.x.x Proxy
  Service instance is compatible with 16.x.x agents and 16.x.x `tsh`, but a
  17.x.x agent will not work with an 16.x.x Proxy Service instance. This also
  means you must not attempt to upgrade from 16.x.x straight to 18.x.x. You must
  upgrade to 17.x.x first.
- Proxy Service instances and agents do not support Auth Service instances that
  are on an older major version, and will fail to connect to older Auth Service
  instances by default. For example, an 18.x.x Proxy Service or agent is not
  compatible with an 17.x.x Auth Service.
- Auth Service instances should always be the first component of the cluster that
  is upgraded, and you must upgrade all Auth Service instances to the target version
  before proceeding to upgrade Proxy Service instances, other agents, and client tools (tsh, tctl, tbot, Connect, etc).
