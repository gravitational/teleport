Open Azure Cloud Shell by navigating to <a href="https://shell.azure.com">shell.azure.com</a>,
or by clicking the Cloud Shell icon in the Azure Portal. Make sure to use the Bash version of Cloud Shell.
Once a Cloud Shell instance opens, paste the generated bash script that downloads the Teleport binary in your Azure Shell and runs the `teleport integration configure azure-oidc` command. The command:
- Creates an enterprise application.
- Configures Teleport as an OIDC IdP for the application.
- Assigns Azure permission to the application.  Teleport read-only permissions to read your directory's data (such as users and groups in the directory).
- Configures authentication by setting up a Teleport SAML service provider.

```code
# Azure Shell
$ bash -c "$(curl 'https://example.com/webapi/scripts/integrations/configure/azureoidc.sh?authConnectorName=entra-id')"

> teleport integration configure azure-oidc --proxy-public-addr=https://example.com --auth-connector-name=entra-id 
...
Success! Use the following information to finish the integration onboarding in Teleport:
Tenant ID: entra-tenant-id
Client ID: enterprise-app-id
Success! You can now go back to the Teleport Web UI to use the integration with Azure.
