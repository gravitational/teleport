Open Azure Cloud Shell by navigating to <a href="https://shell.azure.com">shell.azure.com</a>,
or by clicking the Cloud Shell icon in the Azure Portal. Make sure to use the bash version of Cloud Shell.
Once a Cloud Shell instance opens, paste the Teleport generated bash script that downloads the Teleport binary in your 
Azure Shell and run the `teleport integration configure azure-oidc` command. 
The command performs the following actions:
- Creates an enterprise application.
- Configures Teleport as an OIDC IdP for the application.
- Assigns read-only Microsoft Graph API permissions to read your directory's data (such as users and groups).
- Configures authentication by setting up a Teleport SAML service provider.

```code
# Azure Shell
$ bash -c "$(curl 'https://example.teleport.sh/webapi/scripts/integrations/configure/azureoidc.sh?authConnectorName=entra-id')"

> teleport integration configure azure-oidc --proxy-public-addr=https://example.teleport.sh --auth-connector-name=entra-id 
...
Success! Use the following information to finish the integration onboarding in Teleport:
Tenant ID: entra-tenant-id
Client ID: enterprise-app-id
Success! You can now go back to the Teleport Web UI to use the integration with Azure.
```

Once the script is done setting up the Entra ID tenant with the necessary properties that are 
required for the Teleport Entra ID integration, it prints out the Entra ID tenant ID
and the client ID of the enterprise application set up by the script.
