### "binary missing signature or entitlements" on `tsh device enroll`

A signed and notarized `tsh` binary is necessary to enroll and use a a trusted
device. [Download the macOS tsh installer](../../installation.mdx#macos) to fix
the problem.

### "unauthorized device" errors using a trusted device

A trusted device needs to be registered and enrolled before it is recognized by
Teleport as such. Follow the [registration](../../admin-guides/access-controls/device-trust/device-management.mdx) and
[enrollment](../../admin-guides/access-controls/device-trust/device-management.mdx) steps
and make sure to `tsh logout` and `tsh login` after enrollment is done.

### Auto enrollment not working

Auto-enrollment ceremonies, due to their automated nature, are stricter than
regular enrollment. Additional auto-enrollment checks include:

1. Verifying device profile data, such as data originated from Jamf, against the
   actual device
2. Verifying that the device is not enrolled by another user (auto-enroll cannot
   take devices that are already enrolled)

Check you audit log for clues: look for failed "Device Enroll Token Created"
events and see the "message" field in the details (auto-enroll audit log details
available since Teleport v14.3.33).

If you suspect (1) is the issue, compare the actual device against its inventory
definition (`tsh device collect` executed in the actual device vs `tctl get
device/<asset_tag>`). Tweaking the device profile, manual enrollment or waiting
for the next MDM sync may solve the issue.

If you suspect (2), you can unenroll the device using `tctl edit
device/<asset_tag>` and changing the "enroll_status" field to "not_enrolled".
