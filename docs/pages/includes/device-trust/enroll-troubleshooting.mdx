the problem.

### "unauthorized device" errors using a trusted device

A trusted device needs to be registered and enrolled before it is recognized by
Teleport as such. Follow the [registration](../../admin-guides/access-controls/device-trust/device-management.mdx) and
[enrollment](../../admin-guides/access-controls/device-trust/device-management.mdx) steps
and make sure to `tsh logout` and `tsh login` after enrollment is done.
