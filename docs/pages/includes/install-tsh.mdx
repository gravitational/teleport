    <Admonition type="note">
      The Teleport package in Homebrew is not maintained by Teleport and we can't
      guarantee its reliability or security. We recommend the use of our [own Teleport packages](https://goteleport.com/download?os=mac).

      If you choose to use Homebrew, you must verify that the versions of `tsh` and
      `tctl` are compatible with the versions you run server-side. Homebrew usually
      ships the latest release of Teleport, which may be incompatible with older
      versions. See our [compatibility policy](../get-started/download-install/upgrading/overview.mdx) for details.
