## `enabled`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `bool` | `true` |

`enabled` controls if the operator should be enabled and deployed.

- When `true`, the chart creates both the `CustomResourceDefinition` and operator `Deployment` Kubernetes resources.
- When `false`, the chart creates the `CustomResourceDefinition` resources without the operator `Deployment`.

## `installCRDs`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `"dynamic"` |

`installCRDs` controls if the chart should install the CRDs.
There are 3 possible values: dynamic, always, never.

- "dynamic" means the CRDs are installed if the operator is enabled or if
  the CRDs are already present in the cluster. The presence check is here to
  avoid all CRDs to be removed if you temporarily disable the operator.
  Removing CRDs triggers a cascading deletion, which removes CRs, and all the
  related resources in Teleport.
- "always" means the CRDs are always installed
- "never" means the CRDs are never installed

## `teleportAddress`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `""` |

`teleportAddress` is the address of the Teleport cluster whose resources
are managed by the operator. The address must contain both the domain name and
the port of the Teleport cluster. It can be either the address of the Auth Service
or the Proxy Service.

For example:
  - joining a Proxy: `teleport.example.com:443` or `teleport.example.com:3080`
  - joining an Auth: `teleport-auth.example.com:3025`
  - joining a Cloud-hosted Teleport: `example.teleport.sh:443`

## `caPins`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `list[string]` | `[]` |

`caPins` is a list of Teleport CA fingerprints that is used by the operator to
validate the identity of the Teleport Auth server. This is only used when joining
an Auth server directly (on port `3025`) and is ignored when joining through a Proxy
(port `443` or `3080`).

## `joinMethod`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `"kubernetes"` |

`joinMethod` describes how the Teleport Kubernetes Operator joins the Teleport cluster.
The operator does not store its Teleport-issued identity, it must be able to join the
cluster again on each pod restart. To achieve this, it needs to use a delegated join
method. `kubernetes` is the most common one.

## `teleportClusterName`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `""` |

`teleportClusterName` is the name of the joined Teleport cluster.
Setting this value is required when joining via the
[Kubernetes JWKS](../../join-methods.mdx#kubernetes-jwks) join method.

## `token`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `""` |

`token` is the name of the token used by the operator to join the Teleport cluster.

## `teleportVersionOverride`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `""` |

`teleportVersionOverride` controls the Teleport Kubernetes Operator
image version deployed by the chart.

Normally, the version of the Teleport Kubernetes Operator matches the
version of the chart. If you install chart version 15.0.0, you'll use
Teleport Kubernetes Operator version 15.0.0. Upgrading the operator is
done by upgrading the chart.

<Admonition type="warning">
`teleportVersionOverride` is intended for development and MUST NOT be
used to control the Teleport version in a typical deployment. This
chart is designed to run a specific Teleport version. You will face
compatibility issues trying to run a different Teleport version with it.

If you want to run Teleport version `X.Y.Z`, you should use
`helm install --version X.Y.Z` instead.

</Admonition>

## `image`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `"public.ecr.aws/gravitational/teleport-operator"` |

`image` sets the container image used for Teleport Kubernetes Operator
pods run by the chart.

You can override this to use your own Teleport Kubernetes Operator
image rather than a Teleport-published image.

## `annotations`

### `annotations.deployment`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `object` | `{}` |

`annotations.deployment` contains the Kubernetes annotations
put on the `Deployment` resource created by the chart.

### `annotations.pod`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `object` | `{}` |

`annotations.pod` contains the Kubernetes annotations
put on the `Pod` resources created by the chart.

### `annotations.serviceAccount`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `object` | `{}` |

`annotations.serviceAccount` contains the Kubernetes annotations
put on the `Deployment` resource created by the chart.

## `serviceAccount`

### `serviceAccount.create`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `bool` | `true` |

`serviceAccount.create` controls if the chart should create the Kubernetes
`ServiceAccount` resource for the operator.

- When `true`, the chart creates a `ServiceAccount` resource for the operator.
- When `false`, the chart does not create the `ServiceAccount` resource.
  The user is responsible for deploying and maintaining it separately.

This value can be set to `false` when deploying in constrained environments
where the user deploying the operator is not allowed to edit `ServiceAccount`
resources.

### `serviceAccount.name`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `""` |

`serviceAccount.name` controls the name of the operator Kubernetes `ServiceAccount`.
The operator pods use by default a `ServiceAccount` named after the Helm chart release.
This value overrides this behaviour, this is useful when `serviceAccount.create`
is false and the operator must use an existing `ServiceAccount`.

## `rbac`

### `rbac.create`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `bool` | `true` |

`rbac.create` controls if the chart should create RBAC Kubernetes resources.

- When `true`, the chart creates both `Role` and `RoleBinding` resources for the operator.
- When `false`, the chart does not create the `Role` and `RoleBinding` resources.
  The user is responsible for deploying and maintaining them separately.

This value can be set to `false` when deploying in constrained environments
where the user deploying the operator is not allowed to edit RBAC resources.

## `imagePullPolicy`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `"IfNotPresent"` |

`imagePullPolicy` sets the pull policy for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images)
for more details.

## `resources`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `object` | `{}` |

`resources` sets the resource requests/limits for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
for more details.

## `priorityClassName`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `""` |

`priorityClassName` sets the priority class used by any pods created by the chart.
The user is responsible for creating the `PriorityClass` resource before deploying the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/pod-priority-preemption/)
for more details.

## `tolerations`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `list` | `[]` |

`tolerations` sets the tolerations for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)
for more details.

## `nodeSelector`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `object` | `{}` |

`nodeSelector` sets the node selector for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector)
for more details.

## `affinity`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `object` | `{}` |

`affinity` sets the affinities for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity)
for more details.

## `imagePullSecrets`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `list` | `[]` |

`imagePullSecrets` sets the image pull secrets for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#referring-to-an-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod)
for more details.

## `highAvailability`

### `highAvailability.replicaCount`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `int` | `1` |

`highAvailability.replicaCount` controls the amount of operator pod replicas deployed
by the chart.

When multiple pods are running, all pods join the Teleport cluster on
startup but a single pod actively reconciles resources.

The operator replicas elect a replica leader using
[Kubernetes leases](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/leases/).
If the leader fails, its lease will expire and another replica will start
reconciling resources.

## `tls`

### `tls.existingCASecretName`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `string` | `""` |

`tls.existingCASecretName` makes the operator pods trust an additional CA certificate.
This is used to trust Proxy certificates if they're signed by a private CA. The operator
trusts by default CAs part of Mozilla's Web PKI (the `ca-certificates` package).

To use this value, you must create a Kubernetes `Secret` containing the CA
certs in the same namespace as the Teleport Kubernetes Operator using a
command such as:

```shell
$ kubectl create secret generic my-root-ca --from-file=ca.pem=/path/to/root-ca.pem
```

## `podSecurityContext`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|

`podSecurityContext` sets the pod security context for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod)
for more details.

The default value supports running under the `restricted`
[Pod Security Standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/).

## `securityContext`

| Type | Default |
|------|---------|
| `object` | `{"allowPrivilegeEscalation":false,"capabilities":{"drop":["ALL"]},"readOnlyRootFilesystem":true}` |

`securityContext` sets the container security context for any pods created by the chart.
See [the Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-container)
for more details.

The default value supports running under the `restricted`
[Pod Security Standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/).
