To check that you can connect to your Teleport cluster, sign in with `tsh login`, then 
verify that you can run `tctl` commands using your current credentials. 

For example:

```code
$ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="teleport.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="email@example.com" />
$ tctl status
# Cluster  (=teleport.url=)
# Version  (=teleport.version=)
# CA pin   (=presets.ca_pin=)
```

If you can connect to the cluster and run the `tctl status` command, you can use your
current credentials to run subsequent `tctl` commands from your workstation.
If you host your own Teleport cluster, you can also run `tctl` commands on the computer that 
hosts the Teleport Auth Service for full permissions.
