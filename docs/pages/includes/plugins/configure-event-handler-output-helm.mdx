<summary>Running the Event Handler separately from the log forwarder</summary>

This guide assumes that you are running the Event Handler on the same host or
Kubernetes pod as your log forwarder. If you are not, you will need to instruct
the Event Handler to generate mTLS certificates for subjects besides
`localhost`. To do this, use the `--dns-names` flag of the
`teleport-event-handler` configure command.

For example, if your log forwarder is addressable at {{ forwarder }},
you would run the following `configure` command:

```code
$ teleport-event-handler configure --dns-names={{ forwarder }}
```

The `--dns-names` flag accepts a comma-separated list of DNS names. It will
append subject alternative names (SANs) to the server certificate (the one you
will provide to your log forwarder) for each DNS name in the list.
