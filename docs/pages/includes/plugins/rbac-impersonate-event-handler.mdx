In order for the Event Handler plugin to forward events from your Teleport
cluster, it needs signed credentials from the cluster's certificate authority.
The `teleport-event-handler` user cannot request this itself, and requires
another user to **impersonate** this account in order to request credentials.

Create a role that enables your user to impersonate the `teleport-event-handler`
user. First, paste the following YAML document into a file called
`teleport-event-handler-impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: teleport-event-handler-impersonator
spec:
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of SSH certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 10h

  # This section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    impersonate:
      users: ["teleport-event-handler"]
      roles: ["teleport-event-handler"]
```

Next, create the role:

```code
$ tctl create teleport-event-handler-impersonator.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

Add this role to the user that generates signed credentials for the Event
Handler:

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="teleport-event-handler-impersonator"!)
