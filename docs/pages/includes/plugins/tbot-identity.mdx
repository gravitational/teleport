{{ workload="the plugin" secret="identity-output" }}

Configure `tbot` with an output that will produce the credentials needed by 
{{ workload }}. As {{ workload }} will be accessing the Teleport API, the correct
output type to use is `identity`.

For this guide, the `directory` destination will be used. This will write these
credentials to a specified directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can
be written to by the Linux user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by
the Linux user that {{ workload }} will run as.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output.

If running `tbot` on a Linux server, use the `directory` output to write
identity files to the `/opt/machine-id` directory:

```yaml
services:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

If running `tbot` on Kubernetes, write the identity file to Kubernetes secret
instead:

```yaml
services:
  - type: identity
    destination:
      type: kubernetes_secret
      name: {{ secret }}
```

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode, execute it now.

You should now see an `identity` file under `/opt/machine-id` or a Kubernetes
secret named `{{ secret }}`. This contains the private key and signed
certificates needed by {{ workload }} to authenticate with the Teleport Auth
Service.
