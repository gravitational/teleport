Earlier, we generated a file called `teleport-event-handler.toml` to configure
the Fluentd event handler. This file includes setting similar to the following:

```toml
storage = "./storage"
timeout = "10s"
batch = 20
namespace = "default"
# The window size configures the duration of the time window for the event handler
# to request events from Teleport. By default, this is set to 24 hours.
# Reduce the window size if the events backend cannot manage the event volume 
# for the default window size.
# The window size should be specified as a duration string, parsed by Go's time.ParseDuration.
window-size = "24h"
# types is a comma-separated list of event types to search when forwarding audit
# events. For example, to limit forwarded events to user logins
# and new Access Requests, you can assign this field to
# "user.login,access_request.create".
types = ""
# skip-event-types is a comma-separated list of types of events to skip. For
# example, to forward all audit events except for new app deletion events, you
# can include the following assignment:
# skip-event-types = "app.delete"
skip-event-types: []
# skip-session-types is a comma-separated list of session event types to skip.
# For example, to forward all session events except for malformed SQL packet
# events, you can include the following assignment:
# skip-session-types = "db.session.malformed_packet"
skip-session-types: []

[forward.fluentd]
ca = "/home/bob/event-handler/ca.crt"
cert = "/home/bob/event-handler/client.crt"
key = "/home/bob/event-handler/client.key"
url = "https://fluentd.example.com:8888/test.log"
session-url = "https://fluentd.example.com:8888/session"

[teleport]
addr = "example.teleport.com:443"
identity = "identity"
```

Modify the configuration to replace `fluentd.example.com` with the domain name
of your Fluentd deployment.

Use the following template to create `teleport-plugin-event-handler-values.yaml`:

```yaml
eventHandler:
  storagePath: "./storage"
  timeout: "10s"
  batch: 20
  namespace: "default"
  # The window size configures the duration of the time window for the event handler
  # to request events from Teleport. By default, this is set to 24 hours.
  # Reduce the window size if the events backend cannot manage the event volume 
  # for the default window size.
  # The window size should be specified as a duration string, parsed by Go's time.ParseDuration.
  windowSize: "24h"
  # types is a list of event types to search when forwarding audit
  # events. For example, to limit forwarded events to user logins
  # and new Access Requests, you can assign this field to:
  # ["user.login", "access_request.create"]
  types: []
  # skipEventTypes lists types of events to skip. For example, to forward all
  # audit events except for new app deletion events, you can assign this to:
  # ["app.delete"]
  skipEventTypes: []
  # skipSessionTypes lists session event types to skip. For example, to forward

  # this to:
