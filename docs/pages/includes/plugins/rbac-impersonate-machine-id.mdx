If you haven't set up a Machine ID bot yet, refer to the
[deployment guide](../../machine-workload-identity/deployment/deployment.mdx)
to run the `tbot` binary on your infrastructure.

Next, allow the Machine ID bot to generate credentials for the `access-plugin`
role. You can do this using `tctl`, replacing `my-bot` with the name of your bot:

```code
$ tctl bots update my-bot --add-roles access-plugin
```
