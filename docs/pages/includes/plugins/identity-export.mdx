Like all Teleport users, `access-plugin` needs signed credentials in
order to connect to your Teleport cluster. You will use the `tctl auth sign`
command to request these credentials for your plugin. 

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

The format of the credentials depends on whether you have set up your network to
give the plugin direct access to the Teleport Auth Service, or if all Teleport
clients and services connect to the Teleport Proxy Service instead.

The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `access-plugin` user,
generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
directory:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user=access-plugin --out=auth.pem
```

Teleport's Access Request plugins listen for new and updated Access Requests by
connecting to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

The identity file, `auth.pem`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. Your
Access Request plugin uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service,
which establishes a reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. The plugin
uses this reverse tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the
Auth Service's gRPC endpoint.

You will refer to this file later when configuring the plugin.

<TabItem label="Connect to the Auth Service">

If your network allows your plugin to access the Auth Service directly, e.g.,
you are running the plugin on the Auth Service host, the plugin uses TLS
credentials to connect to the Auth Service's gRPC endpoint and listen for new
and updated Access Requests.

You can generate TLS credentials with the following command:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --format=tls --user=access-plugin --out=auth --ttl=2190h
```

This command should result in three PEM-encoded files: `auth.crt`,
`auth.key`, and `auth.cas` (certificate, private key, and CA certs
respectively). Later, you will configure the plugin to use these credentials to
connect to the Auth Service directly.

  title="Certificate Lifetime"
>

  By default, `tctl auth sign` produces certificates with a relatively short
  lifetime. For production deployments, you can use the `--ttl` flag to ensure a
  more practical certificate lifetime, e.g., `--ttl=8760h` to export a one-year
  certificate.
