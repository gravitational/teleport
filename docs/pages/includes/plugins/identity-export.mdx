{{ client="plugin" secret="plugin-identity" }}

Like all Teleport users, `{{ user }}` needs signed credentials in order to
connect to your Teleport cluster. You will use the `tctl auth sign` command to
request these credentials.

The following `tctl auth sign` command impersonates the `{{ user }}` user,
generates signed credentials, and writes an identity file to the local
directory:

```code
$ tctl auth sign --user={{ user }} --out=identity
```

The {{ client }} connects to the Teleport Auth Service's gRPC endpoint over TLS.

The identity file, `identity`, includes both TLS and SSH credentials. The
{{ client }} uses the SSH credentials to connect to the Proxy Service, which
establishes a reverse tunnel connection to the Auth Service. The {{ client }}
uses this reverse tunnel, along with your TLS credentials, to connect to the
Auth Service's gRPC endpoint.

  title="Certificate Lifetime"
>

  By default, `tctl auth sign` produces certificates with a relatively short
  lifetime. For production deployments, we suggest using [Machine
  ID](../../enroll-resources/machine-id/introduction.mdx) to programmatically issue and renew
  certificates for your plugin. See our Machine ID [getting started
  guide](../../enroll-resources/machine-id/getting-started.mdx) to learn more.

  Note that you cannot issue certificates that are valid longer than your existing credentials.
  For example, to issue certificates with a 1000-hour TTL, you must be logged in with a session that is
  valid for at least 1000 hours. This means your user must have a role allowing
  a `max_session_ttl` of at least 1000 hours (60000 minutes), and you must specify a `--ttl`
  when logging in:

  ```code
  $ tsh login --proxy=teleport.example.com --ttl=60060
  ```

</Details>

If you are running the {{ client }} on a Linux server, create a data directory
to hold certificate files for the {{ client }}:

```code
$ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/teleport/api-credentials
$ sudo mv identity /var/lib/teleport/plugins/api-credentials
```

If you are running the {{ client }} on Kubernetes, Create a Kubernetes secret
that contains the Teleport identity file:

```code
$ kubectl -n teleport create secret generic --from-file=identity {{ secret }}
```

Once the Teleport credentials expire, you will need to renew them by running the
`tctl auth sign` command again.
