As with all Teleport users, the Teleport Auth Service authenticates the
`access-plugin` user by issuing short-lived TLS credentials. In this case, we
will need to request the credentials manually by *impersonating* the
`access-plugin` role and user.

If you are running a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise deployment and are using
`tctl` from the Auth Service host, you will already have impersonation
privileges.

To grant your user impersonation privileges for `access-plugin`, define a role
called `access-plugin-impersonator` by pasting the following YAML document into
a file called `access-plugin-impersonator.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: access-plugin-impersonator
spec:
  allow:
    impersonate:
      roles:
      - access-plugin
      users:
      - access-plugin
```

Create the `access-plugin-impersonator` role: 

```code
$ tctl create -f access-plugin-impersonator.yaml
```

If you are providing identity files to the plugin with Machine ID, assign the
`access-plugin` role to the Machine ID bot user. Otherwise, assign this role to
the user you plan to use to generate credentials for the `access-plugin` role
and user:

(!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="access-plugin-impersonator"!)

You will now be able to generate signed certificates for the `access-plugin`
role and user.
