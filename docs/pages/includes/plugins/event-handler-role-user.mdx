The `teleport-event-handler configure` command generated a file called
`teleport-event-handler-role.yaml`. This file defines a `teleport-event-handler`
role and a user with read-only access to the `event` API:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: teleport-event-handler
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: ['event', 'session']
        verbs: ['list','read']
version: v5
---
kind: user
metadata:
  name: teleport-event-handler
spec:
  roles: ['teleport-event-handler']
version: v2
```

Move this file to your workstation (or recreate it by pasting the snippet above)
and use `tctl` on your workstation to create the role and the user:

```code
$ tctl create -f teleport-event-handler-role.yaml
# user "teleport-event-handler" has been created
# role 'teleport-event-handler' has been created
```
