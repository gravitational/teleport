Access Request plugins need permissions to list and read any Teleport resource
types included in a request. This is because, when the plugin receives a
resource request, it queries the Teleport Auth Service API for data about the
requested resources. 

If you receive an error message similar to the following, the Teleport roles for
the Access Request plugin's identity do not have permissions to perform one or
more operations against the Teleport API. In the example below, the Access
Request plugin needs `list` and `read` permissions on the `user_group` resource:

```
ERRO   Failed to process request error:[
ERROR REPORT:
Original Error: *interceptors.RemoteError access denied to perform action "list" on "user_group", access denied to perform action "read" on "user_group"
```

Make sure the Teleport roles for the Access Request plugin's identity include
permissions to list requested resources. To resolve the error above, for
example, you could grant the following role to the Access Request plugin's
identity:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v7
metadata:
  name: read-user-groups
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
      - resources: [user_group]
        verbs: [list, read]
```
