Access Request plugins need permissions to list and read any Teleport resource
types included in a request. This is because, when the plugin receives a
resource request, it queries the Teleport Auth Service API for data about the
requested resources. 

If you receive an error message similar to the following, make sure the Teleport
roles for the Access Request plugin's identity include permissions to list
requested resources:

```
ERRO   Failed to process request error:[
ERROR REPORT:
Original Error: *interceptors.RemoteError access denied to perform action "list" on "user_group", access denied to perform action "read" on "user_group"
```
