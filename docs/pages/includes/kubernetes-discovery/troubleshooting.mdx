### Discovery Service

To check if the Discovery Service is working correctly, you can check if any Kubernetes 
clusters have been discovered. To do this, you can use the `tctl get kube_cluster` 
command and inspect if the expected clusters have already been imported into Teleport.

If some clusters do not appear in the list, check if the filtering labels match 
the missing cluster tags or look into the service logs for permission errors.

### Kubernetes Service

If the `tctl get kube_cluster` command returns the discovered clusters, but the 
`tsh kube ls` command does not include them, check that you have set the 
`kubernetes_service.resources` section correctly.

```yaml
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - tags:
      "env": "prod"
```

If the section is correctly configured, but clusters still do not appear or 
return authentication errors, please check if permissions have been correctly configured 
in your target cluster or that you have the correct permissions to list Kubernetes clusters 
in Teleport.
