You must ensure that your reverse proxy is communicating with Teleport using HTTPS.
When running Teleport in Kubernetes and using nginx as an ingress, this requires adding
an annotation to the chart values:

```yaml
annotations:
  ingress:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
```

Deploying Teleport behind Cloudflare, whether using its proxy ("orange-clouding") or tunnels
(`cloudflared`) should work. See the [TLS Routing FAQ](../reference/architecture/tls-routing.mdx) for more details.
