#### Teleport version 13.0+

Support for TLS routing behind layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) load balancers and reverse
proxies is available starting from Teleport 13.0. Please ensure your Teleport
cluster and Teleport clients are up to date. If the problem persists, please
submit a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new/choose).

You must ensure that your reverse proxy is communicating with Teleport using HTTPS.
When running Teleport in Kubernetes and using nginx as an ingress, this requires adding
an annotation to the chart values:

```yaml
annotations:
  ingress:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
```

Deploying Teleport behind Cloudflare, whether using its proxy ("orange-clouding") or tunnels
(`cloudflared`) should work with Teleport version 15.1 or higher. See the
[TLS Routing FAQ](../reference/architecture/tls-routing.mdx) for more details.

#### Prior to Teleport version 13.0

Prior to Teleport version 13.0, using Teleport's TLS routing mode behind a layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) proxy is not supported,
due to these proxies terminating TLS themselves and then rewriting their requests to the upstream service, stripping
the additional SNI/ALPN parts of the request in the process.

For older versions, in order for ALPN to work correctly, the Teleport Proxy
Service must terminate TLS itself.

Broadly, this means that prior to Teleport version 13.0, Teleport's TLS routing functionality is incompatible with:
- AWS ALBs (Application Load Balancers)
- AWS NLBs (Network Load Balancers), when using a TLS listener and a public ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager) certificate
- Commonly used HTTP reverse proxies including nginx, Apache, Caddy, Traefik, HAProxy and many others
- Cloudflare tunnels in their default configuration

Deploying Teleport in TLS routing mode behind an HTTP proxy will result in a Teleport Web UI experience that seems
to work perfectly, but the use of `tsh`, `tctl` and attempting to join remote Teleport services to the cluster will fail
with errors like `ssh: overflow reading version string` and `EOF`. A functioning Teleport Web UI is not always an indication
of a correctly configured Teleport cluster.

If in doubt, remove all load balancers/proxies from the equation and connect Teleport clients or agent processes directly to
Teleport's web port to isolate the issue.

To use Teleport behind a reverse proxy prior to Teleport version 13.0, you should either:
- use a layer 4 (TCP) proxy which forwards TCP streams directly to Teleport (which will in turn handle TLS termination itself)
- disable Teleport's TLS routing mode by adding `version: v1` to your config file and removing `proxy_listener_mode: multiplex`

You can get an example `v1` config file using `teleport configure --version=v1 --public-addr=teleport.example.com:443` (change the public address to your own domain)

If disabling TLS routing, consult the [list of default ports](../reference/networking.mdx#ports-without-tls-routing) to use for connecting different Teleport services.
