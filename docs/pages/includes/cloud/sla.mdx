Teleport Cloud commits to an SLA of (=cloud.sla.monthly_percentage=) of monthly uptime,
a maximum of (=cloud.sla.monthly_downtime=) of downtime per month. As we continue to invest in the
cloud product and infrastructure, the SLA will be increased.

In Teleport Cloud accounts that enable multi-region high availability, the SLA
increases to 99.99%.

Edition Pricing
