  # Name of the sync source corresponding to the service.
  # Jamf service sources with the same name manage the same devices, which is
  # particularly relevant during device removal.
  # If you have multiple Jamf sources, make sure to give them distinct,

  # Default is 'jamf'.

  # Default is '0'.
  sync_delay: 0

  # If `true` the Teleport process runs all Jamf syncs immediately and exits as

    # Action to take against devices missing from Jamf but present in Teleport.
    # Valid options are:
