    # to join a cluster. It is not used on subsequent starts.

    # File path example:
    # auth_token: /var/lib/teleport/tokenjoin
    #
    # This is the same as setting join_params.method to "token", and join_params.token_name
    # to the value of auth_token.
    # You should only use either auth_token or join_params.
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # join_params are parameters to set when joining a cluster via
    # EC2, IAM or a token.
    join_params:
        # When `method` is set to "token", it is the equivalent to using `auth_token` above.

        # in the Joining Nodes via EC2 or IAM guides.

    # Optional CA pin of the Auth Service. Specifying a CA pin enables new
    # agents to trust a Teleport cluster when joining via the Auth Service
    # directly. You can assign the ca_pin field to the literal value of the CA
    # pin or an absolute path to a file. If you specify a file, the file should
    # only contain the CA pin.
    #
    # You can also specify the value of the ca_pin key as a YAML list of CA pins
    # or file paths, e.g.:
    #
    # ca_pin:
    #   - /var/lib/teleport/pin1
    #   - /var/lib/teleport/pin2

    # only tunneling through the proxy is supported, so you should specify proxy_server.
    # All other services support both tunneling through the proxy and directly connecting
    # to the auth server, so you can specify either auth_server or proxy_server.

    # Auth Server address and port to connect to. If you enable the Teleport
    # Auth Server to run in High Availability configuration, the address should
    # point to a Load Balancer.
    # If adding a node located behind NAT, use the Proxy URL (e.g. teleport-proxy.example.com:443)
    # and set `proxy_server` instead.
