  # (optional) ldap contains configuration keys used when connecting Teleport
  # to an Active Directory domain. This enables the discovery service for
  # Windows desktops belonging to an Active Directory domain configured for
  # Teleport access.
  ldap:
    # Address of the LDAP server for secure LDAP connections.
    # Usually, this address will use port 636, like: ldap.example.com:636.
    # For best results, this address should point to a highly-available
    # endpoint (a load balancer, VIP, or round-robin DNS) rather than
    # a single domain controller.
    addr: '$LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS'
    # Optional: the server name to use when validating the LDAP server's
    # certificate. Useful in cases where addr is an IP but the server
    # presents a cert with some other hostname.
    server_name: '$LDAP_SERVER_NAME'
    # You can skip LDAPS certificate verification by setting
    # this to true. It is recommended that this be set to false
    # and the certificate added your system's trusted repository,
    # or provided as a PEM encoded certificate using ldap_ca_cert variable.
    # You can provide a filepath with der_ca_file, but this behavior is deprecated.

    # Active Directory domain name you are connecting to.
    domain: '$LDAP_DOMAIN_NAME'
    # LDAP username for authentication. This username must include the domain
    # NetBIOS name. The use of single quotes here is intentional in order to
    # avoid the need to escape the backslash (\) character.
    #
    # For example, if your domain is "example.com", the NetBIOS name for it is
    # likely "EXAMPLE". When connecting as the "svc-teleport" user, you should
    # use the format: "EXAMPLE\svc-teleport".
    username: '$LDAP_USERNAME'
    # The security identifier of the service account specified by the username
    # field above. This looks like a string starting with "S-".
    #
    # Any AD user with permission to read user objects can obtain this value
    # by opening a PowerShell and running
    # ```
    # Get-AdUser -Identity $LDAP_USERNAME | Select SID
    # ```
    #
    # The value can be obtained over LDAP by constructing a query with the
    # filter = (&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=$LDAP_USERNAME))
    # and requesting the attribute = objectSid

  # (optional) hosts is a list of hostnames to register as WindowsDesktop

  # domain configured to grant Teleport access.
  hosts:
  - win1.dev.example.com
  - win2.dev.example.com
  # (optional) non_ad_hosts is a list of hostnames that are not part of an
  # Active Diretory domain to register as WindowsDesktop objects in Teleport.
  # These hosts require the Teleport CA certificate and service, as described in
  # https://goteleport.com/docs/desktop-access/getting-started/
  non_ad_hosts:
  - win3.prod.example.com

  # (optional) settings for enabling automatic desktop discovery via LDAP

    # the Active Directory Domain. To refine the search, specify a custom DN.
    # To disable automatic discovery, leave this field blank.

    # (optional) LDAP filters for further customizing the LDAP search.
    # See https://ldap.com/ldap-filters for details on LDAP filter syntax.
    filters:
    - '(location=Oakland)'

    label_attributes:
    - location
  # Rules for applying labels to Windows hosts based on regular expressions
  # matched against the host name. If multiple rules match, the desktop will
  # get the union of all matching labels.
  # 
  # The rules for matching static hosts (hosts and non_ad_hosts) and discovered hosts
  # are slightly different. See https://goteleport.com/docs/desktop-access/rbac/
