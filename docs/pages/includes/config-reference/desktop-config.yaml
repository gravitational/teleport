windows_desktop_service:
  enabled: yes
  # This is the address that windows_desktop_service will listen on.
  listen_addr: "0.0.0.0:3028"
  # (optional) This is the address that windows_desktop_service will advertise
  # to the rest of Teleport for incoming connections. Only proxy_service should
  # connect to windows_desktop_service, users connect to the proxy's web UI
  # instead.
  public_addr: "desktop-access.example.com:3028"
  # (optional) Determines whether desktop sessions will show a user-selected wallpaper
  # vs a system-default, single-color wallpaper. For improved visual performance,
  # set this to false (its default value).
  show_desktop_wallpaper: false
  # (optional) ldap contains configuration keys used when connecting Teleport
  # to an Active Directory domain. This enables the discovery service for
  # Windows desktops belonging to an Active Directory domain configured for
  # Teleport access.
  ldap:
    # Address of the LDAP server for secure LDAP connections.
    # Usually, this address will use port 636, like: ldap.example.com:636.
    # For best results, this address should point to a highly-available
    # endpoint rather than a single domain controller.
    addr: '$LDAP_SERVER_ADDRESS'
    # Optional: the server name to use when validating the LDAP server's
    # certificate. Useful in cases where addr is an IP but the server
    # presents a cert with some other hostname.
    server_name: '$LDAP_SERVER_NAME'
    # You can skip LDAPS certificate verification by setting
    # this to true. It is recommended that this be set to false
    # and the certificate added your system's trusted repository,
    # or provided as a PEM encoded certificate using ldap_ca_cert variable.
    # You can provide a filepath with der_ca_file, but this behavior is deprecated.
    insecure_skip_verify: false
    # PEM encoded LDAP CA certificate.
    ldap_ca_cert: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          *certificate data*
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    # DER encoded LDAP CA certificate.
    # deprecated: prefer ldap_ca_cert instead
    der_ca_file: /path/to/cert
    # Active Directory domain name you are connecting to.
    domain: '$LDAP_DOMAIN_NAME'
    # LDAP username for authentication. This username must include the domain
    # NetBIOS name. The use of single quotes here is intentional in order to
    # avoid the need to escape the backslash (\) character.
    #
    # For example, if your domain is "example.com", the NetBIOS name for it is
    # likely "EXAMPLE". When connecting as the "svc-teleport" user, you should
    # use the format: "EXAMPLE\svc-teleport".
    username: '$LDAP_USERNAME'
    # The security identifier of the service account specified by the username
    # field above. This looks like a string starting with "S-".
    #
    # Any AD user with permission to read user objects can obtain this value
    # by opening a PowerShell and running
    # ```
    # Get-AdUser -Identity $LDAP_USERNAME | Select SID
    # ```
    #
    # The value can be obtained over LDAP by constructing a query with the
    # filter = (&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=$LDAP_USERNAME))
    # and requesting the attribute = objectSid
    sid: '$LDAP_USER_SID'

  # (optional) When AD support is used, this field allows you to override
  # the domain that Teleport uses for PKI operations. If empty, the domain
  # from the ldap section is used. This can be useful for cases where PKI
  # is configured in a root domain but Teleport is used to provide access
  # to users and computers in a child domain.
  pki_domain: root.example.com

  # (optional) Configures the address of the Kerberos Key Distribution Center,
  # which is used to support RDP Network Level Authentication (NLA).
  # If empty, the LDAP address will be used instead.
  #
  # example: kdc.example.com:88.
  # The port is optional and defaults to port 88 if unspecified.
  #
  # Note: NLA is only supported in Active Directory environments - this field has
  # no effect when connecting to desktops as local Windows users.
  kdc_address: '$KDC_SERVER_ADDRESS'

  # (optional) static_hosts is a list of hosts to register as WindowsDesktop
  # objects in Teleport. You can define host name and labels directly.
  static_hosts:
  - name: example1
    ad: false
    addr: win1.dev.example.com
    labels:
      datacenter: dc1
  - ad: true
    addr: win2.dev.example.com # name will be generated based on address
    labels:
      controller: all

  # (optional) settings for enabling automatic desktop discovery via LDAP
  discovery:
    # The wildcard '*' character tells Teleport to discover all the hosts in
    # the Active Directory Domain. To refine the search, specify a custom DN.
    # To disable automatic discovery, leave this field blank.
    base_dn: '*'
    # (optional) LDAP filters for further customizing the LDAP search.
    # See https://ldap.com/ldap-filters for details on LDAP filter syntax.
    filters:
    - '(location=Oakland)'
    - '(!(primaryGroupID=516))' # exclude domain controllers
    # (optional) LDAP attributes to convert into Teleport labels.
    # The key of the label will be "ldap/" + the value of the attribute.
    label_attributes:
    - location
  # Rules for applying labels to Windows hosts based on regular expressions
  # matched against the host name. If multiple rules match, the desktop will
  # get the union of all matching labels.
  #
  # The rules for matching static hosts and discovered hosts
  # are slightly different. See https://goteleport.com/docs/desktop-access/rbac/
  # for details.
  host_labels:
  - match: '^.*\.dev\.example\.com'
    labels:
      environment: dev
  - match: '^.*\.prod\.example\.com'
    labels:
      environment: prod
  - match: '^EC2AMAZ-'
    labels:
      environment: discovered-in-aws

  # Labels to attach to the Windows Desktop Service. This is used internally, so
  # any custom labels added won't affect the Windows hosts.
  labels:
    teleport.internal/resource-id: "resource-id"
