When Teleport's Auth Service receives a request to list Teleport Nodes (e.g., to
display Nodes in the Web UI or via `tsh ls`), it only returns the Nodes that the
current user is authorized to view.

For each Node in the user's Teleport cluster, the Auth Service applies the
following checks in order and, if one check fails, hides the Node from the user:

- None of the user's roles contain a `deny` rule that matches the Node's labels.
- At least one of the user's roles contains an `allow` rule that matches the
  Node's labels.

If you are not seeing Nodes when expected, make sure that your user's roles
include the appropriate `allow` and `deny` rules as documented in the
[Teleport Access Controls Reference](../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).
