When the Teleport Auth Service receives a request to list Teleport-connected
resources (e.g., to display resources in the Web UI or via `tsh ls`), it only
returns the resources that the current user is authorized to view.

For each resource in the user's Teleport cluster, the Auth Service applies the
following checks in order and, if one check fails, hides the resource from the
user:

- None of the user's roles contain a `deny` rule that matches the resource's
  labels.
- At least one of the user's roles contains an `allow` rule that matches the
  resource's labels.

If you are not seeing resources when expected, make sure that your user's roles
include the appropriate `allow` and `deny` rules as documented in the [Access
Controls Reference](../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx).
