{{ service="your Teleport instance" }}

Grant {{ service }} access to credentials that it can use to authenticate to
AWS.

- If you are running {{ service }} on an EC2 instance, you may use the EC2
Instance Metadata Service method
- If you are running {{ service }} in Kubernetes, you can use IAM Roles for
Service Accounts (IRSA)
- Otherwise, you must use environment variables

{/* TODO(gavin): try out EKS pod identities and add that method here as well */}

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Instance Metadata Service">

Teleport will detect when it is running on an EC2 instance and use the Instance
Metadata Service to fetch credentials.

The EC2 instance should be configured to use an EC2 instance profile. For more
information, see: [Using Instance Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes IRSA">
Refer to [IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) to set up an OIDC provider in AWS and configure an AWS IAM role that allows
the pod's service account to assume the role.
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Environment Variables">

Teleport's built-in AWS client reads credentials from the following environment
variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

When you start {{ service }}, the service reads environment variables from a
file at the path `/etc/default/teleport`. Obtain these credentials from your
organization. Ensure that `/etc/default/teleport` has the following content,
replacing the values of each variable:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=00000000000000000000
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<YOUR_REGION>
```
</TabItem>

<details>
<summary>Have multiple sources of AWS credentials?</summary>

Teleport's AWS client loads credentials from different sources in the following
order:

- Environment Variables
- Shared credentials file
- Shared configuration file (Teleport always enables shared configuration)
- EC2 Instance Metadata (credentials only)

While you can provide AWS credentials via a shared credentials file or shared
configuration file, you will need to run {{ service }} with the `AWS_PROFILE`
environment variable assigned to the name of your profile of choice.

If you have a specific use case that the instructions above do not account for,
consult the documentation for the [AWS SDK for
Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/session/) for a detailed
description of credential loading behavior.
