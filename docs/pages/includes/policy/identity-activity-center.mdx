Teleport Identity Activity Center is a centralized data platform that enhances visibility,
search, and analysis of activity from both human and non-human identities across multiple data sources.

It provides a rich visualization layer that maps real-time access policies
across commonly used platforms such as AWS, GitHub, Okta, and Teleport with the real-time
activity from those identities.

Built to support security and operations teams, Identity Activity Center extends
correlation of identity-based events across platforms. During investigations and incident
response, it surfaces contextual insights powered by an intelligent alerting engine
that detects anomalies from audit logs and highlights unusual behavior and the associated
access levels each identity has across organization services.
