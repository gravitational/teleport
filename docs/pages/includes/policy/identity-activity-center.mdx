Teleport Identity Activity Center is a centralized data platform that enhances visibility, allows to
search and analyze activity from both human and non-human identities across multiple data sources.

It provides a rich visualization layer that maps access policies
across services such as AWS, GitHub, Okta, and Teleport with the real-time
activity from those identities.

Built to assist security and operations teams, Identity Activity Center combines activities
from the same identity across different platforms improving the correlation of identity-based
events across platforms and expedites investigations. 
Through an intelligent alerting engine that detects irregularities in audit logs, emphasizes
odd behavior, and describes the access levels each identity has across corporate services,
it offers contextual insights during incident response.
