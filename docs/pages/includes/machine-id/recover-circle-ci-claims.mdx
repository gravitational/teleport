In order to configure the rules for which CircleCI workflows will be allowed to
connect to your Teleport cluster, you must determine the ID of your CircleCI
organization and create a CircleCI context.

### Find your organization ID

Open CircleCI and navigate to "Organization settings" from the navbar.
You should be presented with an interface titled "Overview" with a section
called "Organization ID". Note this value down and substitute <Var name="organization-id" />
in configuration examples with this.

### Create a context

CircleCI has an organization-level concept called
**contexts**, which allow you to configure a series of secrets that should be
exposed to a workflow job. You can configure CircleCI to control which actors
are allowed to trigger jobs associated with a context.

The contexts that a workflow job has been assigned are also encoded in the
identity token that CircleCI creates for the job. This makes them an ideal way
for Teleport to determine which CircleCI jobs should be granted access to the
Teleport cluster.

In this example, you will create a CircleCI context named `teleport-access`.
You will then grant this context access to your Teleport cluster.

To create the CircleCI context, open up "Organization settings" in CircleCI
and navigate to "Contexts". Click "Create Context" and provide <Var name="teleport-access"/>
as the name of the context you wish to create. You may substitute this value
for a string that makes more sense to your organization, but ensure in future
steps of this guide that you replace <Var name="teleport-access"/> with your value.

Select the context you have just created. You will now be on a page that allows
you to configure the context. To determine the ID of the context
to use when configuring Teleport, locate the URL of the
context settings page, which should have a format similar to the following:

```text
https://app.circleci.com/settings/organization/github/gravitational/contexts/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

In this case, the context ID is: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.

Note this value down and substitute <Var name="context-id" /> in configuration examples
with this
