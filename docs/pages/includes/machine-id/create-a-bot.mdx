Next, you need to create a Bot. A Bot is a Teleport identity for a machine or
group of machines. Like users, bots have a set of roles and traits which define
what they can access.

Create `bot.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: bot
version: v1
metadata:
  # name is a unique identifier for the Bot in the cluster.
  name: example
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles to grant to the Bot. Don't worry if you don't know
  # what roles you need to specify here, the Access Guides will walk you through
  # creating and assigning roles to the already created Bot.
  roles: []
```

Make sure you replace `example` with a unique, descriptive name for your Bot.

Use `tctl` to apply this file:

```code
$ tctl create bot.yaml
```
