By default, `tbot` will run in daemon mode. However, this must then be
configured as a service within the service manager on the Linux host. The
service manager will start `tbot` on boot and ensure it is restarted if it
fails. For this guide, systemd will be demonstrated but `tbot` should be
compatible with all common alternatives.

Use `tbot install systemd` to generate a systemd service file:

```code
$ tbot install systemd \
   --write \
   --config /etc/tbot.yaml \
   --user teleport \
   --group teleport \
   --anonymous-telemetry
```

Ensure that you replace:

- `teleport` with the name of Linux user you wish to run `tbot` as.
- `/etc/tbot.yaml` with the path to the configuration file you have created.

You can omit `--write` to print the systemd service file to the console instead
of writing it to disk.

`--anonymous-telemetry` enables the submission of anonymous usage telemetry.
This helps us shape the future development of `tbot`. You can disable this by
omitting this.

Next, enable the service so that it will start on boot and then start the
service:

```code
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable tbot
$ sudo systemctl start tbot
```

Check the service has started successfully:

```code
$ sudo systemctl status tbot
```
