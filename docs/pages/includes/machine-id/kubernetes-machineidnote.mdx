For self-hosted Teleport Clusters that have non-TLS routing the Kubernetes public
address must be set for Machine ID Kubernetes connections.

To confirm the TLS routing mode check the `proxy.tls_routing_enabled` from this
command with your proxy address:

```code
$ curl https://teleport.example.com:443/webapi/ping | jq
```

The optional tool [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) is used here to help display the JSON output.
If the value `proxy.tls_routing_enabled` is `false` then non-TLS routing
is set and a Kubernetes public address is required so Machine ID
will connect to the right port. You can confirm the Kubernetes public
address is set if `proxy.kube.public_addr` is populated.

The `kube_public_addr` is set within the `proxy_service` by Teleport administrators:

```yaml
proxy_service:
  enabled: true
  kube_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3026
  kube_public_addr: teleport.example.com:3026
```
