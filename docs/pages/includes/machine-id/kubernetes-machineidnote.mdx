For self-hosted Teleport Clusters that have non-TLS routing the Kubernetes public
address must be set for Machine ID Kubernetes connections.

To confirm the TLS routing mode check the `proxy.tls_routing_enabled` from this
command with your proxy address.

```bash
curl https://teleport.example.com:443/webapi/ping | jq
```

If this value is `false` then this will apply. The `kube_public_addr` is set
within the `proxy_service` by administrators.

```yaml
proxy_service:
  enabled: true
  kube_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3026
  kube_public_addr: teleport.example.com:3026
```
