# The following configuration fields are available across most output types.

# destination specifies where the output should write any generated artifacts
# such as certificates and configuration files.
#
# See the full list of supported destinations and their configuration options
# under the Destinations section of this reference page.
destination:
  type: directory
  path: /opt/machine-id
# roles specifies the roles that should be included in the certificates generated
# by the output. These roles must be roles that the bot has been granted
# permission to impersonate.
#
# if no roles are specified, all roles the bot is allowed to impersonate are used.
roles:
  - editor

# certificate_ttl and renewal_interval override the certificate TTL and renewal
# interval for this specific output, so that you can make its certificates valid
# for shorter than `tbot`'s internal certificates.
#
# This is particularly useful when using `tbot` in one-shot as part of a cron job
# where you need `tbot`'s internal certificate to live long enough to be renewed
# on the next invocation, but don't want long-lived workload certificates on-disk.
certificate_ttl: 30m
renewal_interval: 15m
