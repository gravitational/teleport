Configure Teleport to use OIDC authentication as the default instead of the local
user database. 

Edit your `cluster_auth_preference` resource:

```code
$ tctl edit cap
```

In your editor, ensure that the file contains the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:    
  type: oidc
version: v2
```
