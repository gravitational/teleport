{{ level }} Do we use Enterprise or Open Source Teleport for connecting resources to our Teleport Cluster?

Teleport Team, Enterprise, and Enterprise cloud clusters should use the Enterprise release of the 
`teleport` binary for agents. Running the non-Enterprise release could result in
incompatibility to these cluster editions for certain features.

To verify you have a Enterprise release installed run the `teleport version`
command and Enterprise will be in the output.

```code
$ teleport version
# Teleport Enterprise v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
```

Teleport Community Edition clusters should use the Open Source/Community releases. The `teleport version`
will only include Teleport in its output for those releases.

```code
$ teleport version
# Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
```

See the [Installation](../installation.mdx) guide for details on installing to specific platforms
with Enterprise or OSS releases.
