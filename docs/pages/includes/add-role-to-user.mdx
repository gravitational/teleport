{{ role="myrole" user="your Teleport user" }}
Assign the `{{ role }}` role to {{ user }} by running the appropriate
commands for your authentication provider:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Local User">

1. Retrieve your local user's roles as a comma-separated list:
   
   ```code
   $ ROLES=$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.roles | join(",")')
   ```

1. Edit your local user to add the new role:

   ```code
   $ tctl users update $(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') \
     --set-roles "${ROLES?},{{ role }}"
   ```

1. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitHub">

1. Open your `github` authentication connector in a text editor:

   ```code
   $ tctl edit github/github
   ```

1. Edit the `github` connector, adding `{{ role }}` to the `teams_to_roles` section. 
   
   The team you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your 
   organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the team must include your user account and
   should be the smallest team possible within your organization.

   Here is an example:
   
   ```diff
     teams_to_roles:
       - organization: octocats
         team: admins
         roles:
           - access
   +       - {{ role }}
   ```

1. Apply your changes by saving closing the file in your editor.
   
1. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SAML">

1. Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

   ```code
   $ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
   ```

   Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` 
   to the `saml.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the 
   saml.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

1. Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `{{ role }}` to the `attributes_to_roles` section. 
   
   The attribute you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your 
   organization's role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your 
   user account and should be the smallest group possible within your organization.
   
   Here is an example:
   
   ```diff
     attributes_to_roles:
       - name: "groups"
         value: "my-group"
         roles:
           - access
   +       - {{ role }}
   ```

1. Apply your changes:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f saml.yaml
   ```

1. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="OIDC">

1. Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
   ```

   Note that the `--with-secrets` flag adds the value of `spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` 
   to the `oidc.yaml` file. Because this key contains a sensitive value, you should remove the 
   oidc.yaml file immediately after updating the resource.

1. Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `{{ role }}` to the `claims_to_roles` section. 
   
   The claim you should map to this role depends on how you have designed your organization's 
   role-based access controls (RBAC). However, the group must include your user account and
   should be the smallest group possible within your organization.
   
   Here is an example:
   
   ```diff
     claims_to_roles:
       - name: "groups"
         value: "my-group"
         roles:
           - access
   +       - {{ role }}
   ```

1. Apply your changes:
   
   ```code
   $ tctl create -f oidc.yaml
   ```

1. Sign out of the Teleport cluster and sign in again to assume the new role.
