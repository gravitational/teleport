{{ role="myrole" }}
Assign the `{{ role }}` role to your Teleport user by running the following
commands, depending on whether you authenticate as a local Teleport user or via
the `github`, `saml`, or `oidc` authentication connectors:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Local User">

Retrieve your local user's configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get users/$(tsh status -f json | jq -r '.active.username') > out.yaml
```

Edit `out.yaml`, adding `{{ role }}` to the list of existing roles:

```diff
  roles:
   - access
   - auditor
   - editor
+  - {{ role }}
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f out.yaml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="GitHub">

Retrieve your `github`  configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get github/github --with-secrets > github.yaml
```

Edit `github.yaml`, adding `{{ role }}` to the
`teams_to_roles` section. The team you will map to this role will depend on how
you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest team
possible within your organization. This team must also include your user.

Here is an example:

```diff
  teams_to_roles:
    - organization: octocats
      team: admins
      roles:
        - access
+       - {{ role }}
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f github.yaml
```

<Admonition type="warning">
Note the `--with-secrets` flag in the `tctl get` command. This adds the value of
`spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `saml.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,
so take precautions when creating this file and remove it after updating the resource.
</Admonition>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="SAML">

Retrieve your `saml`  configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get --with-secrets saml/mysaml > saml.yaml
```

Edit `saml.yaml`, adding `{{ role }}` to the
`attributes_to_roles` section. The attribute you will map to this role will
depend on how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the
smallest group possible within your organization. This group must also include
your user.

Here is an example:

```diff
  attributes_to_roles:
    - name: "groups"
      value: "my-group"
      roles:
        - access
+       - {{ role }}
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f saml.yaml
```

<Admonition type="warning">

`spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `saml.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,

</Admonition>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="OIDC">

Retrieve your `oidc`  configuration resource:

```code
$ tctl get oidc/myoidc --with-secrets > oidc.yaml
```

Edit `oidc.yaml`, adding `{{ role }}` to the
`claims_to_roles` section. The claim you will map to this role will depend on
how you have designed your organization's RBAC, but it should be the smallest
group possible within your organization. This group must also include your
user.

Here is an example:

```diff
  claims_to_roles:
    - name: "groups"
      value: "my-group"
      roles:
        - access
+       - {{ role }}
```

Apply your changes:

```code
$ tctl create -f saml.yaml
```

<Admonition type="warning">

`spec.signing_key_pair.private_key` to `saml.yaml`. This is a sensitive value,

Log out of your Teleport cluster and log in again to assume the new role.
