Okta API tokens inherit the permissions of the user who created them. These permissions can be
controlled by using [custom admin
roles](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/custom-admin-role/about-creating-custom-admin-roles.htm)
and assigning them to a user who will then create the API token. We recommend
creating a user dedicated to the Teleport Okta API service to manage this token.

### Custom role

The user should have a [custom admin
role](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/custom-admin-role/create-role.htm)
assigned with those minimal permissions:

**User permissions**

- View users and their details
- Edit users' group membership
- Edit users' application assignments

**Group permissions**

- Manage groups

**Application permissions**

- Add and configure applications (only required for installation)
- View applications and their details
- Edit application's user assignments

### Group Membership Admin role

The user should also have built-in ["Group Membership
Admin"](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/administrators-admin-comparison.htm#APItokens)
role assigned to be able to create the API token. **Once API token is created this role can be
unassigned.**

### Resource sets (optional)

If it's desired to limit the Okta integration to a subset of Group and Application resources, [Okta
resource
sets](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/custom-admin-role/create-resource-set.htm)
can be used.

For the resource set to be effective **the user has to have "Group Membership Admin" role
unassigned** and the resource set should be associated with the custom role created earlier.

There is a set to rules that have to be followed when using Okta resource sets.

**Application resources rules:**

- During the integration enrolment "All applications" has to be selected. This is because Teleport
  will try to create a new SAML application or validate the existing one.
- After the integration enrolment is complete, resource set can be limited to a subset of
  Applications, but **extra care has to be taken that "Teleport $cluster" application is included**
  in the subset. Otherwise Teleport won't be able to synchronize users.

**Groups resources rules:**

- If a subset of groups is selected Teleport won't be able to assign ["Everyone" built-in
  group](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/The-Everyone-Group-in-Okta?language=en_US) to the
  "Teleport $cluster" application. **In this case "Everyone" built-in group has to be manually
  assigned to "Teleport $cluster" SAML application.** Otherwise Teleport won't be able to
  synchronize users.

**Users resource rules:**

- Users resources must not be restricted by resource set. "All users" should be selected.
