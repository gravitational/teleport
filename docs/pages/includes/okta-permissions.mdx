Okta API tokens inherit the permissions of the user who created them. These can
be controlled by using [custom admin roles](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/custom-admin-role/about-creating-custom-admin-roles.htm)
and assigning them to a user who will then create the API token. We recommend
creating a user dedicated to the Teleport Okta API service to manage this token.

The permissions required are:

### User permissions

- View users and their details
- Edit users' group membership
- Edit users' application assignments

### Group permissions

- View groups and their details
- Manage group membership

### Application permissions

- Add and configure applications (only required for installation)
- View applications and their details
- Edit application's user assignments

Additionally, the resource set associated with the target user must have
unconstrained access to Users, Applications, and Groups.

One caveat here is that it's impossible to assign API token creation permissions to a
custom role. However, the Okta built in role "Group Membership Admin" has permissions
to create an API token. See more information about built in roles
[here](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Security/administrators-admin-comparison.htm).
