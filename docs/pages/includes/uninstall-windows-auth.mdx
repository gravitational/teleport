If you are using Teleport's Windows auth package to provide passwordless logins for local users,
you can remove it by running the setup program from an administrative command prompt:

```
> teleport-windows-auth-setup.exe uninstall
```

A reboot is necessary after the uninstall completes in order to fully remove the package.
