When discovering EC2 instances, Teleport makes use of IAM invite tokens for
authenticating joining Nodes.

Create a file called `token.yaml`:

```yaml
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: aws-discovery-iam-token
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required (e.g. Node, App, Kube, DB, WindowsDesktop)
  roles: [Node]

  # set the join method allowed for this token
  join_method: iam

  allow:
  # specify the AWS account which Nodes may join from
  - aws_account: "123456789"
```

Assign the `aws_account` field to your AWS account number.
Add the token to the Teleport cluster with:

```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```
