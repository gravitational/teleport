If you are running the Discovery Service on its own host, the service requires a
valid invite token to connect to the cluster. Generate one by running the
following command against your Teleport Auth Service:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery
```

Save the generated token in `/tmp/token` on the Node (EC2 instance) that will
run the Discovery Service.

In order to enable EC2 instance discovery the `discovery_service.aws` section
of `teleport.yaml` must include at least one entry:

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/discovery-group.mdx!)

```yaml
# teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />"
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: false
discovery_service:
  enabled: true
  discovery_group: "aws-prod"
  aws:
   - types: ["ec2"]
     regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1"]
     install:
        join_params:
          token_name: aws-discovery-iam-token
          method: iam
     tags:
       "env": "prod" # Match EC2 instances where tag:env=prod
```

- Edit the `teleport.proxy_server` key to match your Proxy Service's URI
  and port.
- Adjust the keys under `discovery_service.aws` to match your EC2 environment,
  specifically the regions and tags you want to associate with the Discovery
  Service.
