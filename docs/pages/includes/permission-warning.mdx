## Best practices for production security

  When running Teleport in production, you should adhere to the following best
  practices to avoid security incidents:

  - Avoid using `sudo` in production environments unless it's necessary.
  - Create new, non-root, users and use test instances for experimenting with Teleport.
  - Run Teleport's services as a non-root user unless required. Only the SSH
    Service requires root access. Note that you will need root permissions (or
    the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability) to make Teleport listen on a port
    numbered < `1024` (e.g. `443`).
  - Follow the **principle of least privilege**. Don't give users
    permissive roles when more a restrictive role will do.
    For example, don't assign users the built-in `access,editor` roles, which give
    them permissions to access and edit all cluster resources. Instead, define roles 
    with the minimum required permissions for each user and configure
    **Access Requests** to provide temporary elevated permissions.
  - When you enroll Teleport resources—for example, new databases or applications—you 
    should save the invitation token to a file.
    If you enter the token directly on the command line, a malicious user could view
    it by running the `history` command on a compromised system.

You should note that these practices aren't necessarily reflected in the examples used 
in documentation. Examples in the documentation are primarily intended for demonstration 
and for development environments.
