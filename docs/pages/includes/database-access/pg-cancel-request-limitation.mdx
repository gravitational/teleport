### Unable to cancel a query

If you use a PostgreSQL cli client like `psql`, and you try to cancel a query
with `ctrl+c`, but it doesn't cancel the query, then you need to connect using a
tsh local proxy instead.
When `psql` cancels a query, it establishes a new connection without TLS
certificates, however Teleport requires TLS certificates not only for
authentication, but also to route database connections.

If you
[enable TLS Routing in Teleport](../../admin-guides/management/operations/tls-routing.mdx)
then `tsh db connect` will automatically start a local proxy for every
connection.
Alternatively, you can connect via
[Teleport Connect](../../connect-your-client/teleport-connect.mdx)
which also uses a local proxy.
Otherwise, you need to start a tsh local proxy manually using `tsh proxy db`
and connect via the local proxy.

If you have already started a long-running query in a `psql` session that you
cannot cancel with ctrl+c, you can start a new client session to cancel that
query manually:

First, find the query's process identifier (PID):
```sql
{{ PIDQuery }}
```

Next, gracefully cancel the query using its PID.
This will send a SIGINT signal to the postgres backend process for that query:
```sql
SELECT pg_cancel_backend(<PID>);
```

You should always try to gracefully terminate a query first, but if graceful
cancellation is taking too long, then you can forcefully terminate the query
instead.
This will send a SIGTERM signal to the postgres backend process for that query:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(<PID>);
```

See the PostgreSQL documentation on
[admin functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SIGNAL)
for more information about the `pg_cancel_backend` and `pg_terminate_backend`
functions.
