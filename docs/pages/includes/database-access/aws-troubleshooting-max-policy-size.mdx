### Maximum policy size exceeded errors

Due to [IAM and STS character
limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html#reference_iam-quotas-entity-length),
you may encounter one of the following errors in the Database Service logs when
large numbers of databases are registered:
- `LimitExceeded: Maximum policy size of 2048 bytes exceeded for user <iam-user>`
- `LimitExceeded: Maximum policy size of 10240 bytes exceeded for role <iam-role>`

For reference, a user policy can maintain permissions for approximately 6
Redshift databases, or 20 RDS databases due to the IAM policy character limits.
A role policy can maintain permissions for approximately 30 Redshift databases,
or 100 RDS databases.

One way to work around this is to manually manage the IAM policy used for database
connections, and use a wildcard `"*"` for `"Resource"` to reduce the policy size:

<Details title="use a wildcard policy" opened={false}>

Attach a policy with the following permissions to the IAM user or role:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="RDS">
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "rds-db:connect",
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Redshift">
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "redshift:GetClusterCredentials",
              "Resource": "*"
          }
      ]
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can safely remove the inline policy created by the Database Service and the
IAM permissions for the Database Service to `Get/Put/Delete` the user or role
policy.

</Details>

Another option is to deploy [the Database Service in a highly available (HA)
configuration](../../database-access/guides/ha.mdx) where databases can be
sharded to separate Database Services with different IAM roles.

If the limit is exceeded for a user policy, it is also recommended to use an
IAM role for the Database Service instead.
