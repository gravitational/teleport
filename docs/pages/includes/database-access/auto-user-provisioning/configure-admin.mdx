Teleport should be able to connect to the database as a user that can create
other users and assign them roles.

Choose a name for the Teleport automatic user provisioning admin: <Var name="teleport-admin"/>

<Admonition type="tip">
We recommend creating a separate user
designated specifically for Teleport automatic user provisioning.
