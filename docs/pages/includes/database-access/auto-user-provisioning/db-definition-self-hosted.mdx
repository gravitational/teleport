Next, configure the database admin user in the Teleport database configuration:

```yaml
kind: db
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  protocol: "{{ protocol }}"
  uri: "{{ uri }}"
  admin_user:
    name: "teleport-admin"
```

This example assumes that you have configured the database as a dynamic
resource. If you have configured your database using a static Teleport Database
Service configuration, edit the entry in your `db_service.databases`
configuration.
