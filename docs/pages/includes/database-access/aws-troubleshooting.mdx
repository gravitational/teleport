### Certificate error

If your `tsh db connect` error includes the following text, you likely have an RDS database created before July 28, 2020, which presents an X.509 certificate that is incompatible with Teleport:

```text
x509: certificate relies on legacy Common Name field, use SANs instead
```

AWS provides instructions to rotate your [SSL/TLS certificate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL-certificate-rotation.html).

### Timeout errors

The Teleport Database Service needs connectivity to your database endpoints. That may require
enabling inbound traffic on the database from the Database Service on the same VPC or routing rules from another VPC. Using the `nc`
program you can verify connections to databases:

```code
$ nc -zv postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com 5432
# Connection to postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com (172.31.24.172) 5432 port [tcp/postgresql] succeeded!
```

### Not authorized to perform `sts:AssumeRole`

The Database Service assumes an IAM role in one of following situations:

- An IAM role is used as `db_user` when accessing AWS services that require IAM
  roles as database users, such as DynamoDB, Keyspaces, Opensearch, and
  Redshift Serverless.
- The `assume_role_arn` field is specified for the database resources or
  dynamic resource matchers.

<Details title="Role chaining">
When both of the above conditions are true for a database connection, the
Database Service performs a role chaining by assuming the IAM role specified
`assume_role_arn` first then using that IAM role to assume the IAM role for
`db_user`.
</Details>

You may encounter the following error if the trust relationship is not
configured properly between the IAM roles:
```text
AccessDenied: User: arn:aws:sts::111111111111:assumed-role/database-service-role/i-* is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/database-user-role
```

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/iam_role_trust_relationship.mdx!)

You can test the trust relationship by running this AWS CLI command as `role1`:
```code
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/role2 --role-session-name test-trust-relationship
```
