In some deployments the same logical database is reachable via multiple hostnames with different characteristics, for example:

* replicated databases
* hostnames that traverse different network paths

If this applies to your setup, list all hosts in order of preference to improve connection resiliency.

If a TCP dial error occurs for a host, the next host in the list is tried automatically. Non-network errors (e.g., certificate or authentication failures) are not retried and do not advance to the next host.

By default, hosts are attempted in the listed order. Retries cycle through the list and wrap to the start as needed (e.g., `host1 → host2 → host3 → host1 → ...`). To randomize the sequence per connection attempt, set `shuffle_hostnames`; the same cyclic pattern then applies to that randomized order.

`retry_count` controls the number of retries per host after the initial attempt on a network error. The default is `2`, so there are 3 total attempts per host (1 initial + 2 retries) before moving to the next host in sequence.

This setup supports failover and basic load-balancing for new connections: enabling `shuffle_hostnames` spreads initial connection attempts across hosts (load-balancing), while retries automatically move to the next host if the current one is unreachable (failover).

```yaml
- name: oracle
  protocol: oracle
  uri: host1:2484,host2:2484,host3:2484  # Multiple hosts; dials in sequence and wraps (host1 → host2 → host3 → host1 ...). Dialing sequence can be randomized with `shuffle_hostnames`.
  static_labels:
    env: dev
  oracle:
    # Randomize host order per connection attempt to spread load. Optional.
    shuffle_hostnames: true
    # Retries per host on network errors only; non-network errors stop (default: 2). Optional.
    retry_count: 5            
```
