### Could not find default credentials 

This error can come from either your client application or Teleport.

For a client application, ensure that you disable GCP credential loading.
Your client should not attempt to load credentials because GCP credentials will
be provided by the Teleport Database Service.

If you see the credentials error message in the Teleport Database Service logs
(at DEBUG log level), then the Teleport Database Service does not have GCP
credentials configured correctly.

If you are using a service account key, then ensure that the environment
variable
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json` is set and restart
your Teleport Database Service to ensure that the env var is available to
`teleport`.
For example, if your Teleport Database Service runs as a `systemd` service:
```code
$ echo 'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/teleport
$ sudo systemctl restart teleport
```

See [authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service-accounts)
in the Google Cloud documentation for more information about service account
authentication methods.
