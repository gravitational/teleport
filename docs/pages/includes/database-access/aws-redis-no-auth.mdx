If you choose not to use the above options, Teleport will not automatically
authenticate with the database.

You can either set up a "no password" configuration for your {{ dbType }} user,
or manually enter an `AUTH` command with the password you have configured after
a successful client connection. However, it is strongly advised to use one of
the first two options or a strong password for better security.
