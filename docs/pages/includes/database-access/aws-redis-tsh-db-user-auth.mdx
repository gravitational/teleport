If flag `--db-user` is not provided, Teleport logs in as the `default` user.

Now, depending on the authentication configurations, you may need to send an
`AUTH` command to authenticate with the Redis server:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Redis with ACL">
    The Database Service automatically authenticates Teleport-managed and
    IAM-enabled users with the database. No `AUTH` command is required after
    successful connection.

    If you are connecting as a user that is not managed by Teleport and is not
    IAM-enabled, the connection normally starts as the `default` user.
    Now you can authenticate the database user with its password:

    ```
    AUTH my-database-user <USER_PASSWORD>
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Redis with AUTH token">
    Now you can authenticate with the shared AUTH token:

    ```
    AUTH <SHARED_AUTH_TOKEN>
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Redis without AUTH">
    For Redis or Valkey deployments without the ACL system or legacy
    `requirepass` directive enabled, no `AUTH` command is required.
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
