<Details title="Why do I need my own CA?">
Distributed databases like {{ db }} use mTLS for node-to-node communication.
Teleport requires that you have your own CA to issue certificates for 
node-to-node mTLS communication.

Teleport uses a split-CA architecture for database access. The Teleport `db` CA 
issues server certificates and the `db_client` CA issues client certificates.

Databases are configured to trust the Teleport `db_client` CA for client
authentication, but not the `db` CA. 
Additionally, Teleport only issues *ephemeral* `db_client` CA certificates.

When a {{ db }} node connects to another {{ db }} node, it must present a 
certificate that the other node trusts for client authentication.
Since Teleport does not issue long-lived `db_client` certificates, the node
needs to have a long-lived certificate issued by another CA that its peer node
trusts.

The split `db` and `db_client` CA architecture was introduced as a security fix 
in Teleport versions
(= db_client_ca.released_version.v14 =) and
(= db_client_ca.released_version.v15 =).
