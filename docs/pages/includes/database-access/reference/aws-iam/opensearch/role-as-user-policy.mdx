OpenSearch maps IAM roles to OpenSearch backend roles.
The Teleport Database Service must be able to assume these "access" IAM roles to
sign the OpenSearch API requests.

Refer to
[Fine-grained access control in Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/fgac.html)
for more information about the permissions you can configure for these roles.
