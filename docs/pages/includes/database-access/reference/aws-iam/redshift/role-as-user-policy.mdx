The following permissions policy should be attached to an IAM role that Teleport
users can specify as a database user.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "RedshiftConnectWithIAM",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

| Statement | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
|`RedshiftConnectWithIAM` | Connect to a Redshift database as a database user mapped 1:1 from this IAM identity. |

An IAM role can connect as an automatically created database user with
permissions mapped 1:1 from the identity's IAM permissions.
Permissions in the database are granted with `redshift-data:*` statements
attached to the IAM identity, for example `redshift-data:GetStatementResult`.
Teleport users can connect as that role by specifying "role/\{RoleName\}" as a
database user, e.g.

```code
$ tsh db connect redshift-example-db --db-user=role/{{ dbUserRole }}
```

See
[Using identity-based policies for Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/redshift-iam-access-control-identity-based.html)
for more information about available Redshift IAM permissions that are mapped
to the database user.
