The Teleport Database Service assumes a user-specified IAM role when forwarding
requests to Keyspaces on their behalf.
Keyspaces-related IAM permissions must be attached to that IAM role.

Refer to the
[Amazon Keyspaces identity-based policy examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html)
for more information about the Keyspaces permissions that you can grant to an
IAM role.
