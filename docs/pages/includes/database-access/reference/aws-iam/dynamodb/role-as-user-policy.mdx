The Teleport Database Service assumes a user-specified IAM role when forwarding
requests to DynamoDB on their behalf.
DynamoDB-related IAM permissions must be attached to that IAM role.

Refer to
[Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazondynamodb.html)
for more information about DynamoDB permissions.
