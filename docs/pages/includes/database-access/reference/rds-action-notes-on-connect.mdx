The `rds-db:connect` permission is required to connect to databases.
You can reduce the scope of the permission to only allow specific databases,
regions, or users.
The resource ARN has the following format:
```code
arn:aws:rds-db:{Region}:{AccountID}:dbuser:{ResourceID}/{UserName}
```

Refer to
[Creating and using an IAM policy for IAM database access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.IAMPolicy.html)
for more information about the `rds-db:connect` permission grant syntax.
