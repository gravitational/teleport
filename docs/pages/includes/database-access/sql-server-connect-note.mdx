<Admonition type="note">
Either the `sqlcmd` or `mssql-cli` command-line clients should be available in
`PATH` in order to be able to connect. `tsh` attempts to run `sqlcmd` first and,
if it's not present on the `PATH`, runs `mssql-cli`.

If you have neither command-line clients available on your system, you can run
the following command to start a local proxy server that you can connect to with
your SQL Server client:

```code
$ tsh proxy db --db-user=teleport --tunnel sqlserver
```

Read the [Database GUI Clients](../../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx#sql-server-with-azure-data-studio) 
guide for how to connect your DB GUI client to the local proxy.
