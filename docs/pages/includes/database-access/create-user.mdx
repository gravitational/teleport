Create a local Teleport user with the built-in `access` role:

```code
$ tctl users add --roles=access alice
```

The `access` role allows users to see all connected database servers, but
database names and accounts are restricted to the user's `db_names` and
`db_users` traits. Normally, these traits come from the identity provider. For
the local user you've just created you can update them manually to allow it to
connect to any database as any database user.

First, export the user resource:

```code
$ tctl get users/alice > alice.yaml
```

Update the resource to include the following traits:

```yaml
traits:
  db_users:
  - "*"
  db_names:
  - "*"
```

Update the user:

```code
$ tctl create alice.yaml -f
```

For more detailed information about database access controls and how to restricted
access see [RBAC](../../database-access/rbac.mdx) documentation.
