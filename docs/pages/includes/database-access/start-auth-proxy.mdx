Teleport requires a valid TLS certificate to operate and can fetch one
automatically using Let's Encrypt's ACME protocol. Before Let's Encrypt can
issue a TLS certificate for the Teleport Proxy host's domain, the ACME protocol
must verify that an HTTPS server is reachable on port 443 of the host.  

We will assume that you have configured DNS records for `teleport.example.com`
and `*.teleport.example.com` to point to your Teleport Node.

<Admonition type="note" title="Web Proxy Port">
To support the ACME protocol, Teleport Proxy must listen on port 443, rather
than the default port 3080.

Download the latest version of Teleport for your platform from our
[downloads page](https://goteleport.com/teleport/download) and follow the
installation [instructions](../../installation.mdx).

Next, start the Teleport Auth and Proxy Services:

```code
$ sudo teleport start
```

<TabItem label="Teleport Cloud" scope={["cloud"]}> 
If you do not have a Teleport Cloud account, use our [signup form](/signup) to
get started. Teleport Cloud manages instances of the Proxy Service and Auth
Service, and automatically issues and renews the required TLS certificate.

You will need to download the Enterprise version of Teleport from the
[customer portal](https://dashboard.gravitational.com/web/login) to run `tctl`
commands in Teleport Cloud.

You must log into your cluster before you can run `tctl` commands.
```code
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh
$ tctl status
```
