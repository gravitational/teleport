The Teleport Database Service needs permissions to automatically download
your Cloud SQL instance's root CA certificate and to general an ephemeral
client certificate.

If you intend to download the CA certificate manually and your Cloud SQL
instance SSL mode is not "require trusted client certificates", then you can
skip this step.

Otherwise, in the second step of the service account creation dialogue, assign
the service account the pre-defined GCP IAM role "Cloud SQL Client", then click
"Done".

<details>
<summary>Cloud SQL Client permissions</summary>
The "Cloud SQL Client" role has the following permissions:

```ini
# Used to auto-download the instance's root CA certificate and check SSL mode.
cloudsql.instances.get
# Used to generate an ephemeral client certificate
cloudsql.instances.connect
```

If you only need one of these permissions, you can define and assign a custom
IAM role to the service account instead.
