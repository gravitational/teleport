Teleport uses mutual TLS authentication with self-hosted databases. These
databases must be able to verify certificates presented by the Teleport Database
Service. Self-hosted databases also need a certificate/key pair that Teleport
can verify.

By default, the Teleport Database Service trusts certificates issued by a
certificate authority managed by the Teleport Auth Service. You can either:
- Configure your self-hosted database to trust this CA, and instruct Teleport to
  issue a certificate for the database to present to the Teleport Database
  Service.
- Configure the Database Service to trust a custom CA.

<TabItem label="Use the Teleport CA">

To configure the database to trust the Teleport CA and issue a certificate for
the database, follow these instructions on your workstation:

1. To use `tctl` from your workstation, your Teleport user must be allowed to
   impersonate the system role `Db` in order to be able to generate the database
   certificate. Include the following `allow` rule in in your Teleport user's
   role:

   ```yaml
   allow:
     impersonate:
       users: ["Db"]
       roles: ["Db"]
   ```

1. Export Teleport's certificate authority and a generate certificate/key pair.
   This example generates a certificate with a 1-year validity period.
   `db.example.com` is the hostname where the Teleport Database Service can
   reach the {{ dbname }} server.

   ```code
   $ tctl auth sign --format={{ format }} --host=db.example.com --out=server --ttl=2190h
   ```

   (!docs/pages/includes/database-access/ttl-note.mdx!)

   The command creates 3 files: `server.cas`, `server.crt` and `server.key`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Use a custom CA" >

If the {{ dbname }} database already has a CA that it uses to sign certificates
, you only need to export a Teleport CA certificate for the database to
authenticate traffic from the Teleport Database Service. You do not need to
enable `Db` impersonation privileges.

1. Replace <Var name="example.teleport.sh:443" /> with the host and web port of
   the Teleport Proxy Service in your cluster. Run the following command on your
   workstation:

   ```code
   $ tctl auth export --type=db-client --auth-server=<Var name="example.teleport.sh:443" /> > db-client.cas
   ```

   The command creates 1 file, `db-client.cas`.

1. Append the contents of `db-client.cas` to your database's existing CA cert
   file, which this guide expects to be called `server.cas`.

1. Generate `server.crt` and `server.key` by retrieving a TLS certificate and
   private key from your existing database CA, signed for your database server.
   You will use these files later in the guide.
