<Admonition type="note" title="Certificate Rotation">
  Teleport 9.1 introduced new database certificate authority that is only used by Database Access.
  Older Teleport versions uses host certificate to sign Database Access certificates.
  After upgrading to Teleport 9.1 the host certificate authority will be still used by Database Access to maintain compatibility.
  The first [certificate rotation](../../setup/operations/ca-rotation.mdx) will rotate host and database certificates.
  New Teleport 9.1+ installations generate database certificate authority on the first start and they are not affected
  by the rotation procedure described above.
