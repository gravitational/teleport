The Teleport Database Service requires connectivity to your database endpoints.

Check that firewall rules (e.g., AWS security groups) allow connectivity between the Teleport Database Service and the database endpoint.
- Inbound firewall rules for the database must allow connections from the Teleport Database Service.
- Outbound firewall rules for the Teleport Database Service must allow connections to the database endpoint.

<Admonition type="tip">
On the same host as the Teleport Database Service, try running `nc` to check if it can reach the database port.

- Database host: <Var name="database-host" initial="postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com" />
- Database port: <Var name="database-port" initial="5432" />

```code
$ nc -zv <Var name="database-host" /> <Var name="database-port" />
# Connection to postgres-instance-1.sadas.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com (172.31.24.172) 5432 port [tcp/postgresql] succeeded!
```

For deployments in AWS, it may be helpful to use [AWS Reachability Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/reachability/what-is-reachability-analyzer.html) to analyze the network path between the Teleport Database Service and the database.

1. Identify the Elastic Network Interface (ENI) associated with the Teleport Database Service host. This can be found in the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?NIC).
2. Identify the private IP address of the database.
3. Create and analyze a network path:
    - Set the path source to the ENI associated with the Teleport Database Service host.
    - Set the path destination to the database IP.
4. Check the analysis results to identify reachability issues.
