The Teleport Database Service proxies traffic from users to {{ dbType }}
for Redis and Valkey. Authentication between the Database Service and the
{{ dbType }} can take one of two forms:

- **IAM authentication (preferred):** The Teleport Database Service connects to
  the database using a short-lived AWS IAM authentication token. AWS IAM
  authentication is available for {{ dbType }} with engine version 7.0 or above.
- **Managing users:** The Teleport Database Service manages users in a access
  control list, rotates their passwords every 15 minutes, and saves these
  passwords in AWS Secrets Manager. The Database Service automatically sends an
  `AUTH` command with the saved password when connecting the client to the
  {{ dbType }} server.
