Teleport can provide secure access to {{ dbName }} via the  [Teleport Database
Service](../../database-access/introduction.mdx). This allows for fine-grained
access control through the [Teleport RBAC
system](../../database-access/rbac.mdx).

The Teleport Database Service proxies traffic from database clients to
self-hosted databases in your infrastructure. Teleport maintains a certificate
authority for database clients. You configure your database to trust the
Teleport database client CA, and the Teleport Database Service presents
certificates signed by this CA when proxying user traffic. With this setup,
there is no need to store long-lived credentials for self-hosted databases.

Meanwhile, the Teleport Database Service verifies self-hosted databases by
checking their TLS certificates against either the Teleport database CA or a
custom CA chosen by the user.

In this guide, you will:

1. Configure your {{ dbType }} database for Teleport access.
1. Add the database to your Teleport cluster.
1. Connect to the database via Teleport
