There are a couple of ways for the Teleport Database Service to access Azure
resources:

- The Database Service can run on an Azure VM with attached managed identity. This
  is the recommended way of deploying the Database Service in production since
  it eliminates the need to manage Azure credentials.
- The Database Service can be registered as a Microsoft Entra ID application
  (via "App registrations") and configured with its credentials. This is only
  recommended for development and testing purposes since it requires Azure
  credentials to be present in the Database Service's environment.

  Go to the [Managed Identities](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity%2FuserAssignedIdentities)
  page in your Azure portal and click *Create* to create a new user-assigned
  managed identity:

  ![Managed identities](../../../img/azure/managed-identities@2x.png)

  Pick a name and resource group for the new identity and create it:

  ![New identity](../../../img/database-access/guides/azure/new-identity.png)

  Take note of the created identity's *Client ID*:

  ![Created identity](../../../img/database-access/guides/azure/created-identity.png)

  Next, navigate to the Azure VM that will run your Database Service instance and
  add the identity you've just created to it:

  ![VM identity](../../../img/database-access/guides/azure/vm-identity.png)

  Attach this identity to all Azure VMs that will be running the Database
  Service.

  <Admonition type="note">
    Registering the Database Service as a Microsoft Entra ID application is
    suitable for test and development scenarios, or if your Database Service
    does not run on an Azure VM. For production scenarios prefer to use the
    managed identity
    approach.

  Go to the [App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)
  page of Microsoft Entra ID and click on *New registration*:

  ![App registrations](../../../img/azure/app-registrations@2x.png)

  Pick a name (e.g. *DatabaseService*) and register a new application. Once the
  app has been created, take note of its *Application (client) ID* and click on
  *Add a certificate or secret*:

  ![Registered app](../../../img/database-access/guides/azure/registered-app@2x.png)

  Create a new client secret that the Database Service agent will use to
  authenticate with the Azure API:

  ![Registered app secrets](../../../img/azure/registered-app-secrets@2x.png)

  The Teleport Database Service uses Azure SDK's default credential provider chain to
  look for credentials. Refer to [Azure SDK Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/azure-sdk-authorization)
  to pick a method suitable for your use-case. For example, to use
  environment-based authentication with a client secret, the Database Service should
  have the following environment variables set:

  ```code
  export AZURE_TENANT_ID=
  export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=
  export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=
  ```
