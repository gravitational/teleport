Each Redis user must be protected by a strong password. We recommend using OpenSSL to generate passwords:

```code
openssl rand -hex 32
```

<Admonition type="note">
  If you have access to Redis you can also generate a password by using the below command from the Redis console:

  ```
  ACL GENPASS
  ```
</Admonition>

Create a `users.acl` file, which defines users for your Redis deployment, passwords required to log in as a given user,
and sets of ACL rules. Redis allows you to provide passwords in plaintext or an SHA256 hash.
We strongly recommend using an SHA256 hash instead of plaintext passwords.

You can use the command below to generate an SHA256 hash from a password.
```code
echo -n STRONG_GENERATED_PASSWORD | sha256sum
```

```text
user alice on #57639ed88a85996453555f22f5aa4147b4c9614056585d931e5d976f610651e9 allcommands allkeys
user default off
```

For more ACL examples refer to the [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/docs/manual/security/acl/).

<Admonition type="warning">
  It's very important to either disable or protect with a password the `default` user. Otherwise, everyone with access
  to the database can log in as the `default` user, which by default has administrator privileges.
</Admonition>
