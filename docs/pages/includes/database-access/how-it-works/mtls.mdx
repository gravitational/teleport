The Teleport Database Service authenticates to your self-hosted {{ db }}
database using mutual TLS. {{ db }} trusts the Teleport certificate authority
for database clients, and presents a certificate signed by either the Teleport
database CA or a custom CA. When a user initiates a database session, the
Teleport Database Service presents a certificate signed by Teleport. The
authenticated connection then proxies client traffic from the user.
