To install a Teleport Agent on your Linux server:

The recommended installation method is the cluster install script.
It will select the correct version, edition, and installation mode for your cluster.

1. Assign <Var name="teleport.example.com:443"/> to your Teleport cluster
   hostname and port, but not the scheme (https://).

1. Run your cluster's install script:

   ```code
   $ curl "https://<Var name="teleport.example.com:443"/>/scripts/install.sh" | sudo bash
   ```
