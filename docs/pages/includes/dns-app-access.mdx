Once the Teleport Application Service is proxying traffic to your web
application, the Teleport Proxy Service makes the application available at the
following URL:

```text
https://<APPLICATION_NAME>.<TELEPORT_DOMAIN>
```

For example, if your Teleport domain name is `teleport.example.com`, the
application named `my-app` would be available at
`https://my-app.teleport.example.com`. The Proxy Service must present a TLS
certificate for this domain name that browsers can verify against a certificate
authority.

If you are using Teleport Enterprise (Cloud), DNS records and TLS certificates
for this domain name are provisioned automatically. If you are self-hosting
Teleport, you must configure these yourself:

1. Create either:
   - A DNS A record that associates a wildcard subdomain of your Teleport Proxy
     Service domain, e.g., `*.teleport.example.com`, with the IP address of the
     Teleport Proxy Service.
   - A DNS CNAME record that associates a wildcard subdomain of your Proxy
     Service domain, e.g., `*.teleport.example.com`, with the domain name of the
     Teleport Proxy Service.

1. Ensure that your system provisions TLS certificates for Teleport-registered
   applications. The method to use depends on how you originally set up TLS for
   your self-hosted Teleport deployment, and is outside the scope of this guide. 

   In general, the same system that provisions TLS certificates signed for the
   web address of the Proxy Service (e.g., `teleport.example.com`) must also
   provision certificates for the wildcard address used for applications (e.g.,
   `*.teleport.example.com`).

Take care not to create DNS records that map the Teleport cluster subdomain of a
registered application to the application's own host, as attempts to navigate to
the application will fail.
