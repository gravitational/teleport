<Admonition type="warning">
Discovery Service exposes a configuration parameter - `discovery_service.discovery_group` -
that allows you to group discovered resources into different sets. This parameter
is used to prevent Discovery Agents watching different sets of cloud resources
from colliding against each other and deleting resources created by another services.

When running multiple Discovery Services, you must ensure that each service is configured
with the same `discovery_group` value if they are watching the same cloud resources
or a different value if they are watching different cloud resources.

It is possible to run a mix of configurations in the same Teleport cluster meaning
that some Discovery Services can be configured to watch the same cloud resources
while others watch different resources. As an example, a 4-agent high availability
configuration analyzing data from two different cloud accounts would run with
the following configuration.

- 2 Discovery Services configured with `discovery_group: "prod"` polling data
from Production account.
- 2 Discovery Services configured with `discovery_group: "staging"` polling data
from Staging account.
