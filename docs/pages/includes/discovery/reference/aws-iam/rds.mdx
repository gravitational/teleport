| Statement | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| `RDSDiscovery` | Discover RDS instances and Aurora clusters. |

When configured to discover RDS databases, the Teleport Discovery Service
will attempt to discover both RDS instances and Aurora clusters.
The `rds:DescribeDBInstances` permission is used to find RDS instances, but it
is also used to find additional information about discovered Aurora clusters, so
you should include this permission even if you only have Aurora clusters to
discover.
If you don't want Aurora cluster discovery, then you can omit the
`rds:DescribeDBClusters` permission.
