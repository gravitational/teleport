Teleport {{ resourceDesc }} auto-discovery involves two components:

1. The Teleport Discovery Service that watches for new {{ resourceDesc }}s or
changes to previously discovered {{ resourceDesc }}s.
It dynamically registers each discovered {{ resourceDesc }} as a
`{{ resourceKind }}` resource in your Teleport cluster.
It does not need connectivity to the {{ resourceDesc }}s it discovers.
2. The Teleport {{ serviceName }} Service that monitors the dynamic
`{{ resourceKind }}` resources registered by the Discovery Service.
It proxies communications between users and the {{ resourceDesc }}.
