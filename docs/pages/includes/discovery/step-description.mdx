Teleport {{ serviceName }} auto-discovery involves two components.

The first, the Discovery Service, is responsible for watching your cloud
provider and checking if there are any new {{ resourceDesc }}s or if there have
been any modifications to previously discovered {{ resourceDesc }}s. It
dynamically registers each discovered {{ resourceDesc }} as a
`{{ resourceKind }}` resource in your Teleport cluster.
The second, the {{ serviceName }} Service, monitors the dynamic
`{{ resourceKind }}` resources registered by the Discovery Service.
It proxies communications between users and the {{ resourceDesc }}.

<Admonition type="tip">

This guide presents the Discovery Service and {{ serviceName }} Service running
in the same process, however both can run independently and on different machines. 

For example, you can run an instance of the {{ serviceName }} Service in the
same private network as the {{ resourceDesc }}s you want to register with your
Teleport cluster, and an instance of the Discovery Service in any network you
wish.
