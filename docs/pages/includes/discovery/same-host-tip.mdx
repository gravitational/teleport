<Admonition type="tip">

This guide presents the Discovery Service and {{ serviceName }} Service running
in the same process, however both can run independently and on different machines. 

For example, you can run an instance of the {{ serviceName }} Service in the
same private network as the {{ resourceDesc }}s you want to register with your
Teleport cluster, and an instance of the Discovery Service in any network you
wish.
