### Database Service troubleshooting

#### Databases do not appear in `tctl db ls`

If the `tctl get db` command returns the discovered databases you expect, but
the `tctl db ls` command does not include them, check that you have set the 
`db_service.resources` section correctly, for example:

```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "env": "prod"
```

If the section is correctly configured, but databases still do not appear,
check that you have the correct permissions to list databases in Teleport.
You should have a Teleport role that matches the database labels and allows
the "read" and "list" verbs for `db` and `db_server` objects.
Here's an example that grants those permissions for every database in your
cluster:

```yaml
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: view-all-databases
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      '*': '*'
    rules:
      - resources: [db_server, db]
        verbs: [read, list]
```

#### Errors when connecting to a database

<Admonition type="note">
This section assumes you have already provisioned a database user and configured
Teleport RBAC for that database user by following a specific guide in 
[Enroll AWS Databases](../../enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/enroll-aws-databases.mdx).
</Admonition>

If there are connection errors when you try to connect to a database, then
first check if there are multiple `db_server` heartbeat resources for the target
database: `tctl get db_server/yourDatabaseName`.
If there are, it means that multiple Teleport Database Service instances are
proxying the database - this is an HA setup that will complicate
troubleshooting.
Teleport will choose one of those Database Service instances at random to proxy
the connection and if one of them can't reach the database endpoint or lacks 
permissions, then you will see random connection errors.
{/* TODO(gavin): once we add healthchecks, we can remove this advice. HA shouldn't make connections randomly fail. */}

Even if connection errors are consistent, you should scale down or reconfigure
your Teleport Database Service instances such that only one matches the target `db`
while you are troubleshooting errors.
Verify that there is only one `db_server` with `tctl get db_server/yourDatabaseName`
and then try the connection again.

Check the Teleport Database Service logs with DEBUG level logging enabled and
look for network or permissions errors.

Refer to the [Database Service troubleshooting
guide](../../enroll-resources/database-access/troubleshooting.mdx) for more
general troubleshooting steps.

Additionally, a guide specific to the type of database in
[Enroll AWS Databases](../../enroll-resources/database-access/enroll-aws-databases/enroll-aws-databases.mdx).
may have more specific troubleshooting information.
