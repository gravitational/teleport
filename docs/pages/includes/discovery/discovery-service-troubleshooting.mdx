### Discovery Service

To check if the Discovery Service is working correctly, you can check if any
{{ resourceKind }}s have been discovered.
To do this, you can use the `tctl get {{ tctlResource }}` command and check if the
expected {{ resourceKind }}s have already been registered with your Teleport
cluster.

If some {{ resourceKind }}s do not appear in the list, check if the Discovery
Service selector labels match the missing {{ resourceKind }} tags or look into
the Discovery Service logs for permission errors.

If you are running multiple Discovery Services, you must ensure that each
service is configured with the same `discovery_group` value if they are watching
the same cloud {{ resourceKind }}s or a different value if they are watching different
cloud {{ resourceKind }}s.
If this is not configured correctly, a typical symptom is `{{ tctlResource }}`
resources being intermittently deleted from your Teleport cluster's registry.
