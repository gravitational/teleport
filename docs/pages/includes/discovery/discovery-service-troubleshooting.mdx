### Discovery Service troubleshooting

First, check if any {{ resourceKind }}s have been discovered.
To do this, you can use the `tctl get {{ tctlResource }}` command and check if the
expected {{ resourceKind }}s have already been registered with your Teleport
cluster.

If some {{ resourceKind }}s do not appear in the list, check if the Discovery
Service selector labels match the missing {{ resourceKind }} tags or look into
the Discovery Service logs for permission errors.

Check that the Discovery Service is running with credentials for the correct AWS
account. It can discover resources in another AWS account, but it must be
configured to assume a role in the other AWS account if that's the case.

Check if there is more than one Discovery Services running:

```code
$ tctl inventory status --connected
```

If you are running multiple Discovery Services, you must ensure that each
service is configured with the same `discovery_group` value if they are watching
the same cloud {{ resourceKind }}s or a different value if they are watching different
cloud {{ resourceKind }}s.
If this is not configured correctly, a typical symptom is `{{ tctlResource }}`
resources being intermittently deleted from your Teleport cluster's registry.
