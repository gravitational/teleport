### Kubernetes Service troubleshooting

If the `tctl get kube_cluster` command returns the discovered clusters, but the 
`tctl kube ls` command does not include them, check that you have set the 
`kubernetes_service.resources` section correctly.

```yaml
kubernetes_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "env": "prod"
```

If the section is correctly configured, but clusters still do not appear or 
return authentication errors, please check if permissions have been correctly configured 
in your target cluster or that you have the correct permissions to list Kubernetes clusters 
in Teleport.
