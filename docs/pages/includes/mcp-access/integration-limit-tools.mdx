<Admonition type="tip" title="Limiting MCP Tools">
You can restrict which MCP tools Teleport users can access by refining the
`mcp.tools` list in their role. Only the tools you include will be available to
that role. For example:
```yaml
kind: role
version: v8
metadata:
  name: {{service}}-mcp-readonly
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:
      'service': '{{service}}'
    mcp:
      tools:
      - {{tool}}
```
