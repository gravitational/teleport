When starting your MCP client, you might see an error such as `spawn <tsh-path>
ENOENT` or `command not found`:

![ENOENT error](../../../img/mcp-access/troubleshoot-tsh-binary-enoent.png)

This error indicates the path to the `tsh` binary is misconfigured in the
client’s settings. To fix it, re-run the `tsh mcp config` command to update the
path, or manually correct it in the client’s configuration file. See [connect
MCP clients](../../connect-your-client/model-context-protocol/mcp-access.mdx)
for more details.

This issue can also occur due to a bug from the managed update feature, which
has been fixed in version 18.2.3. If your Teleport cluster has managed update
enabled for tools, check your `tsh` version by:
```bash
$ tsh version
Teleport v18.2.3 git:v18.2.3-0-xxxxxxxx go1.24.7
Proxy version: 18.2.0
Proxy: steve.teleport.test:34443
Re-executed from version: 18.2.0
```

The first line shows the version of the `tsh` binary from the managed update,
and the last line shows the version from your original installation. Both
versions must be at least `18.2.3` to fully resolve this issue.

If managed-update version is outdated, contact your Teleport administrator to
raise the version for tools update.  If your local `tsh` (e.g. `which tsh`) is
outdated, uninstall it and install a newer release.

Once `tsh` has been updated, re-run the `tsh mcp config` commands to reconfigure
your MCP client.
