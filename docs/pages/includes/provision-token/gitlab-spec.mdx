    # allow is an array of rule configurations for what GitLab CI jobs should be
    # allowed to join. All options configured within one allow entry
    # must be satisfied for the GitLab CI run to be allowed to join. Where
    # multiple allow entries are specified, any job which satisfies all of the
    # options within a single entry will be allowed to join.

    # An allow entry must include at least one of:
    # - project_path
    # - namespace_path
    # - sub

    # able to access your Teleport cluster.
