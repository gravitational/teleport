      # If set to a public key in SSH authorized_keys format, the
      # joining client must have the corresponding private key to join. This
      # keypair may be created using `tbot keypair create`. If set,
      # `registration_secret` and `must_register_before` are ignored.
      initial_public_key: ""

      # If set to a secret string value, a client may use this secret to perform
      # the first join without pre-registering a public key in
      # `initial_public_key`. If unset and no `initial_public_key` is provided,
      # a random value will be generated automatically into
      # `.status.bound_keypair.registration_secret`.
      registration_secret: ""

      # If set to an RFC 3339 timestamp, attempts to register via
      # `registration_secret` will be denied once the timestamp has elapsed. If
      # more time is needed, this field can be edited to extend the registration
      # period.

    # Fields related to recovery after certificates have expired.
    recovery:
      # The maximum number of allowed recovery attempts. This value may
      # be raised or lowered after creation to allow additional recovery
      # attempts should the initial limit be exhausted. If `mode` is set to
      # `standard`, recovery attempts will only be allowed if
      # `.status.bound_keypair.recovery_count` is less than this limit. This
      # limit is not enforced if `mode` is set to `relaxed` or `insecure`. This
      # value must be at least 1 to allow for the initial join during
      # onboarding, which counts as a recovery.
      limit: 1

      # The recovery rule enforcement mode. Valid values:
      # - standard (or unset): all configured rules enforced. The recovery limit
      #   and client join state are required and verified. This is the most
      #   secure recovery mode.
      # - relaxed: recovery limit is not enforced, but client join state is
      #   still required. This effectively allows unlimited recovery attempts,
      #   but client join state still helps mitigate stolen credentials.
      # - insecure: neither the recovery limit nor client join state are
      #   enforced. This allows any client with the private key to join freely.
      #   This is less secure, but can be useful in certain situations, like in
      #   otherwise unsupported CI/CD providers. This mode should be used with
      #   care, and RBAC rules should be configured to heavily restrict which
      #   resources this identity can access.
      mode: "standard"

    # If set to an RFC 3339 timestamp, once elapsed, a keypair rotation will be
    # forced on next join if it has not already been rotated. The most recent
    # rotation is recorded in `.status.bound_keypair.last_rotated_at`.
