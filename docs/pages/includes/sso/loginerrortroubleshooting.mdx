### Using the Web UI

If you get "access denied" or other login errors, the number one place to check is the Audit
Log on the Teleport Auth Server. You can access it in the **Activity** tab of the Teleport Web UI.

Example of a user being denied because the role `clusteradmin` wasn't set up:

```json
{
  "code": "T1001W",
  "error": "role clusteradmin is not found",
  "event": "user.login",
  "method": "oidc",
  "success": false,
  "time": "2019-06-15T19:38:07Z",
  "uid": "cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"
}
```

### On the Auth Service host
All editions can provide the ability to review the Audit Log in the Web UI. In self hosted
You can monitor Audit Log file entries and process logs on the Teleport Auth Server.
The Audit Log is located in `/var/lib/teleport/log` by
default and it will contain a detailed reason why a user's login was denied.

  If you are using a Teleport storage configuration that does not store log entries locally, this will not appear. You can look at the `teleport`
process logs to see `ERROR` and `INFO` entries.

Example of a user being denied because the role `clusteradmin` wasn't set up:


```json
{
  "code": "T1001W",
  "error": "role clusteradmin is not found",
  "event": "user.login",
  "method": "oidc",

  "time": "2019-06-15T19:38:07Z",
  "uid": "cd9e45d0-b68c-43c3-87cf-73c4e0ec37e9"
}
```

Some errors (like filesystem permissions or a misconfigured network) can be
diagnosed using Teleport's `stderr` log, which is usually available via:

```code
$ sudo journalctl -fu teleport
```

If you wish to increase the verbosity of Teleport's logs, you can pass the
[`--debug`](../../setup/reference/cli.mdx#teleport-start) flag to the `teleport start` command.
