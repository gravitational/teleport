<summary>IdP-initiated SSO</summary>
    Enabling the `spec.allow_idp_initiated` flag in SAML connectors allows users to
    log in to Teleport with one click from the dashboard provided by the IdP.

    This feature is potentially unsafe and should be used with caution.

    Enabling IdP-initiated login comes with notable security risks such as:
    - Possibility of replay attacks on the SAML payload giving an attacker a secret web session
  - Increased risk of session hijacking and impersonation attacks based on intercepting SAML communications
