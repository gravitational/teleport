{{ idp="your SSO provider" }}

You can register your Teleport cluster as an application with {{ idp }}, then
create an **authentication connector** resource that provides Teleport with
information about your application. When a user signs in to Teleport, {{ idp }}
executes its own authentication flow, then sends an HTTP request to your
Teleport cluster to indicate that authentication has completed.

Teleport authenticates users to your infrastructure by issuing short-lived
certificates. After a user completes an SSO authentication flow, Teleport issues
short-lived TLS and SSH certificates to the user. Teleport also creates a
temporary user on the Auth Service backend. 

Teleport roles are encoded in the user's certificates. To assign Teleport roles
to the user, the Auth Service inspects the **role mapping** within the
authentication connector, which associates user data on {{ idp }} with the names
of one or more Teleport roles.
