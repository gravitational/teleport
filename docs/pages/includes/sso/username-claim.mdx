By default, Teleport expects an `email` claim to be present in the OIDC claim. 
The value from the `email` claim is used as a username in Teleport. If you wish 
to use another claim to configure username, you can override the 
default expected `email` claim with the `username_claim` field in the auth 
connector spec. 

The example below shows configuring the `username_claim` field with `preferred_username`
value. This will configure Teleport to query `preferred_username` claim instead 
of the `email` claim.:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  # ...
spec:
  # ...
  username_claim: preferred_username
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Username claim">
  Ensure that the claim value you use to configure `username_claim` is a uniquely
  identifiable value for the user. 
</Admonition>
