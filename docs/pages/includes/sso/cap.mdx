Edit your cluster authentication preferences so you can make the authentication
connector you configured in this guide the default authentication method for
your Teleport cluster.

Open the Teleport Web UI. From the left sidebar, navigate to **Zero Trust
Access** > **Auth Connectors**. Find the connector you would like to make the
default and, from its three-dot menu, select **Set as default**. 

If you are managing your Teleport resources as configuration files, you can
choose a default authentication connector using a dynamic resource. In this
case, use `tctl` to edit the `cluster_auth_preference` value:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_auth_preference
```

Set the value of `spec.type` to `{{ type }}`:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  ...
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  ...
  type: {{ type }}
  ...
version: v2
```

After you save and exit the editor, `tctl` will update the resource:

```text
cluster auth preference has been updated
```

The cluster auth preference is available as a Teleport Terraform provider
resource. Find a list of configuration options in the [Cluster Auth Preferences
Resource
Reference](../../reference/infrastructure-as-code/teleport-resources/cluster-auth-preferences.mdx).

If you self-host Teleport, you can edit your Teleport Auth Service configuration
file to include the following:

```yaml
# Snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: {{ type }}
```

</details>

If you need to log in again before configuring your identity provider, use the
flag <nobr>`--auth=local`</nobr>.
