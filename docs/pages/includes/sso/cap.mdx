By editing the `cluster_auth_preference` resource we can make the authentication
connector you configured in this guide the default authentication method for
your Teleport cluster.

Configure Teleport to use your identity provider as the default authentication
method instead of the local user database.

Use `tctl` to edit the `cluster_auth_preference` value:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_auth_preference
```

Set the value of `spec.type` to `{{ type }}`:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  ...
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  ...
  type: {{ type }}
  ...
version: v2
```

After you save and exit the editor, `tctl` will update the resource:

```text
cluster auth preference has been updated
```

<details>
<summary>Static configuration file</summary>

You can also edit your Teleport configuration file to include the following:

```yaml
# Snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: {{ type }}
```

</details>

If you need to log in again before configuring your identity provider, use the
flag <nobr>`--auth=local`</nobr>.
