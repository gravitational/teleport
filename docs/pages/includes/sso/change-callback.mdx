The callback address can be changed if calling back to a remote machine
instead of the local machine is required:

```code
# --bind-addr sets the host and port tsh will listen on, and --callback changes
# what link is displayed to the user
$ tsh login --proxy=proxy.example.com --auth=github --bind-addr=localhost:1234 --callback https://remote.machine:1234
```

For this to work the hostname or CIDR of the remote machine that will be used for
the callback will need to be allowed via your auth connector's `client_redirect_settings`:

```yaml
kind: oidc
metadata:
  name: example-connector
spec:
  client_redirect_settings:
    # a list of hostnames allowed for HTTPS client redirect URLs
    # can be a regex pattern
    allowed_https_hostnames:
      - remote.machine
      - '*.app.github.dev'
      - '^\d+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.foo.internal$'
    # a list of CIDRs allowed for HTTP or HTTPS client redirect URLs
    insecure_allowed_cidr_ranges:
      - '192.168.1.0/24'
      - '2001:db8::/96'
```
