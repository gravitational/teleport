<Details title="SAML Single Logout">
    Setting the `spec.single_logout_url` endpoint in SAML connectors enables SAML SLO (Single Logout).
    If enabled, upon logging out of Teleport, users will also be logged out of the SAML provider session, which 
    may also log them out of any other non-Teleport applications which they are currently logged into using the same SAML provider.

    For optimal user experience, we recommend keeping this disabled unless necessary.

    Refer to your SAML provider's documentation for instructions on where to obtain this URL.
