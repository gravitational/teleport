When a user authenticates to Teleport, the Teleport Auth Service issues SSH and
TLS certificates to the user that contain the user's Teleport roles. 

For SSO authentication connectors, the Auth Service determines which roles to
encode in the certificate by reading the authentication connector's **role
mapping**. The role mapping indicates which Teleport roles to assign based on
data that your identity provider stores about the user.

When you configure an authentication connector using the `tctl` CLI, a role
mapping takes the following format:

```text
<{{fieldType}}_name>,<{{fieldType}}_value>,<teleport_role_1>,<teleport_role_2>,...,<teleport_role_n>
```

For example, the following role mapping means that any user with the {{fieldType}}
`groups` with the value `admin` receives the Teleport roles `editor` and
`auditor`:

```text
groups,admin,editor,auditor
```

For the purpose of this guide, assign two separate role mappings:

- A more permissive role mapping: <Var name="mapping_1" initial="groups,admins,auditor,editor" />
- A more restrictive role mapping: <Var name="mapping_2" initial="groups,users,access" />
