To change log levels in Teleport, you can use either of the following methods:

- Debug Service: Allows on-the-fly log level adjustments without restarting the
  instance, which is ideal for troubleshooting sessions.
- Updating configuration: Involves updating the Teleport configuration file and
  restarting the instance.

<TabItem label="Debug Service">
The Teleport Debug Service allows administrators to dynamically manage log levels
without restarting the instance. The service, enabled by default, ensures
local-only access and must be consumed from inside the same instance.

To change the instance log level use the `teleport debug set-log-level` command:

```code
$ teleport debug set-log-level DEBUG
Changed log level from "INFO" to "DEBUG".

$ kubectl -n teleport exec my-pod -- teleport debug set-log-level DEBUG
Changed log level from "INFO" to "DEBUG".
```

If you're unsure what is the current level you can retrieve it using
`teleport debug get-log-level`.

To diagnose problems, you can configure the `teleport` process to run with
verbose logging enabled by passing it the `-d` flag. `teleport` will write logs
to stderr.

Alternatively, you can set the log level from the Teleport configuration file:

```yaml
teleport:
  log:
    severity: DEBUG
```

Restart the `teleport` process to apply the modified log level. Logs will resemble
the following (these logs were printed while joining a server to a cluster, then
terminating the `teleport` process on the server):

After troubleshooting, remember to turn the log level back to avoid generating
unnecessary logs.
