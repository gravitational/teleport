  # The OLTP exporter to send traces to. Possible values:
  #    "grpc://collector.example.com"
  #      - Traces will be exported via gRPC to the provided URL.

  #       - Traces will be exported via HTTP to the provided URL.
  #    "file:///var/lib/teleport/traces"
  #       - Traces will be saved to files within the provided directory. Each file
  #         will contain one proto encoded span per line. Files are rotated after
  #         reaching 100MB. To override the rotation limit add
  #         ?limit=<desired_file_size_in_bytes> to the exporter_url
  #         (i.e. file:///var/lib/teleport/traces?limit=100)

  # 0 will not sample any spans generated by Teleport but will respect any parent span's sampling.
