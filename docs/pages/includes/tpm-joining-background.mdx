The `tpm` join method is a secure way for Bots and Agents to authenticate with
the Teleport Auth Service without using any shared secrets. Instead of using a
shared secret, the unique identity of the host's Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
and public key cryptography is used to authenticate the host.

In environments where there is no other form of identity available to machines,
e.g on-prem, this is the most secure method for joining. It avoids the need to
distribute a shared secret as is needed for the `token` join method.

A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a secure, physical cryptoprocessor that is
installed on a host. TPMs can store cryptographic material and perform a number
of cryptographic operations, without exposing the cryptographic material to the
operating system. Each TPM has a unique key pair burned-in known as the
Endorsement Key (EK).

Some TPMs also contain an X.509 certificate for this key pair that is signed by
the manufacturer's CA. This is known as the EK Certificate (EKCert). This
certificate can be used by the TPM to prove to a third-party (who trusts the
manufacturer's CA) that the TPM is genuine and abides by the TPM specification.

When using the `tpm` join method, you must first query the TPM's public key and
then create a join token that explicitly allows this public key. Even if the
host operating system is reinstalled, the EK public key will not change, meaning
that the TPM will still be usable to join your Teleport cluster. If you have a
large number of hosts, it may make sense to use automation tooling such as
ansible to query the TPMs across your fleet and then generate join tokens.
