Teleport Enterprise and Enterprise Cloud customers should use the Enterprise release of the 
`teleport` binary for agents. Running the Community Edition binary could result in
incompatibility to these cluster editions for certain features.

To verify you have a Teleport Enterprise release installed run the `teleport version`
command and Enterprise will be in the output.

```code
$ teleport version
# Teleport Enterprise v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
```

Teleport Community Edition clusters should use the Teleport Community Edition releases. The `teleport version`
command will only include Teleport in its output for those releases.

```code
$ teleport version
# Teleport v(=teleport.version=) go(=teleport.golang=)
```

See the [Installation](../installation/installation.mdx) guide for details on installing to specific platforms
with Enterprise or Teleport Community Edition releases.
