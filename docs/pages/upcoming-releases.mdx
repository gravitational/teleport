## Teleport

| Version | Date           |
| ------- | ---------------|
| 16.0.0  | June 14, 2024  |

### 16.0.0

#### Teleport VNet

Teleport 16 introduces Teleport VNet, a new feature that provides a virtual IP
subnet and DNS server that automatically proxies TCP connections to Teleport
apps over mutually authenticated tunnels.

This will allow scripts and software applications to connect to any
Teleport-protected application as if they were connected to a VPN, without the
need to manage local tunnels.

#### Per-session MFA for applications

Teleport 16 will support per-session MFA checks when accessing web and TCP applications.

#### Device Trust support for the Web UI

With Teleport 16, Device Trust checks can be enforced for workflows that require the Web UI.
This includes access to web applications and Windows desktops.

Teleport Connect must be installed on user workstations in order to satisfy device checks.

## Teleport Cloud

The key deliverables for Teleport Cloud in the next quarter:

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
