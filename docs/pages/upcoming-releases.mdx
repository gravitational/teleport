Teleport releases a new major version approximately every 4 months, and provides
security-critical support for the current and two previous major versions. With
our typical release cadence, we usually support each major version for 12
months.

## Teleport

We plan to release the following versions in the coming months:

| Version | Date                       |
|---------|----------------------------|
| 18.4.0  | Week of November 10, 2025  |
| 18.5.0  | Week of December 1, 2025   |

We continue to support the following major versions of Teleport:

| Release | Release Date      | EOL              | Minimum `tsh` version |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| v18.x   | July 3, 2025      | August 2027      | v17.0.0               |
| v17.x   | November 16, 2024 | August 2026      | v16.0.0               |
| v16.x   | June 14, 2024     | October 31 2025  | v15.0.0               |

### 18.4.0

#### Streamable-HTTP and SSE support for MCP Zero-Trust Access

MCP Zero-Trust Access users will be able to secure and audit connections to MCP
servers that use HTTP-based transport protocols in addition to stdio.

#### Improved Bot Instances Dashboard

The Bot Instances dashboard will now provide a more intuitive interface
for managing a fleet of Machine & Workload Identity bot instances. This will
include improved filtering, sorting and searching capabilities, and a high-level
overview of the versions of all bot instances in the cluster.

#### Updated Oracle Joining Support

Oracle compute instances are no longer required to have additional IAM permissions granted
to them in order to join. Oracle join tokens will also allow restricting which instances
may leverage a token to join.

#### Direct node-to-node `tsh scp`

tsh will be able to copy files directly between two hosts via 
`tsh scp alice@foo:/path/1.txt bob@bar:/path/2.txt`.

### 18.5.0

#### Kubernetes support for Relay Service

The relay service will be extended to facilitate Kubernetes connections.

#### Shared state between `tsh` and Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect and `tsh` will share the same local state.
Logins from one app will automatically be reflected in the other.

| November 3, 2025   | Teleport 18.3 agents will begin rollout to eligible tenants. |

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
