## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
