[GitHub
Proxy](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/management/guides/github-integration)
integration.

#### AWS Identity Center integration improvements

AWS Identity Center integration will support using IAM authentication instead
of OIDC (useful for private clusters) and a hybrid setup that allows to use
another IdP as external identity source.

#### Okta integration improvements

Teleport Okta integration will include updated guided enrollment flow and will
allow updating integration settings (such as sync configuration or group filters)
without having to recreate the integration.

### 17.4.0

#### Database access for Oracle RDS

Teleport database access will support connecting to Oracle RDS with Kerberos
authentication.

#### Okta integration read-only mode

Teleport Okta integration will support read-only mode that does not back-propagate

Teleport web UI will provide detailed status dashboard for AWS integration as
well as the new "user tasks" view that will highlight integration issues requiring
user attention along with suggested remediation steps.

#### Windows desktop improvements

Teleport will support registering the same host twice - once as a domain-joined
machine, and one as a standalone machine. This will allow Teleport users to connect
as Active Directory users and local users to the same host.

### 17.5.0

#### Encrypted session recordings

Teleport will provide the ability to integrate with Hardware Security Modules
(HSMs) in order to encrypt session recordings prior to uploading them to storage.

#### Azure Console via SAML IdP

#### Desktop Access in Teleport Connect

Teleport Connect will allow users to connect to Windows desktops directly from
the Teleport Connect application without needing to use a browser.

#### VNet for SSH

Teleport's VNet feature will be available for SSH, allowing users to access
SSH servers protected by Teleport as if they were on the same network.

### 18.0.0

#### Identity Activity Center

Teleport Identity Security (fka Teleport Policy) will provide an Identity Activity
Center to allow users to correlate user activity by multiple factors to facilitate
incident response. The first iteration will support integrations with GitHub, Okta
and AWS.

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
