Teleport releases a new major version approximately every 4 months, and provides
security-critical support for the current and two previous major versions. With
our typical release cadence, we usually support each major version for 12
months.

## Teleport

We plan to release the following versions in the coming months:

| Version | Date                       |
|---------|----------------------------|
| 18.3.0  | Week of October 27, 2025   |
| 18.4.0  | Week of November 10, 2025  |

We continue to support the following major versions of Teleport:

| Release | Release Date      | EOL              | Minimum `tsh` version |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| v18.x   | July 3, 2025      | August 2027      | v17.0.0               |
| v17.x   | November 16, 2024 | August 2026      | v16.0.0               |
| v16.x   | June 14, 2024     | October 31 2025  | v15.0.0               |

### 18.3.0

#### Web UI Workload ID

Teleport's web UI will list all workload identity resources registered in the cluster.

#### Relay Service

Teleport will ship with a new relay service that acts as a lightweight proxy service,
receiving connections from both SSH clients and agents.

The relay service can be used to avoid routing SSH connections through the broader Teleport
control plane, providing the ability to optimize network flows in large or complex deployments.

#### Multi-cluster Discovery

Teleport EC2 auto-discovery will support a use-case in which multiple Teleport clusters
discover the same EC2 instances without interfering with each other.

#### Kubernetes Health Checks

The Kubernetes service will perform regular health checks for registered Kubernetes clusters.
Health status will be reported in the Teleport web UI and reflected in kube_server resources.
Teleport will prioritizes healthy services when routing user connections to Kubernetes clusters.

#### ElastiCache Serverless

Teleport Database Access will support connecting to ElastiCache Serverless databases.

### 18.4.0

#### Streamable-HTTP and SSE support for MCP Zero-Trust Access

MCP Zero-Trust Access users will be able to secure and audit connections to MCP
servers that use HTTP-based transport protocols in addition to stdio.

#### Improved Bot Instances Dashboard

The Bot Instances dashboard will now provide a more intuitive interface
for managing a fleet of Machine & Workload Identity bot instances. This will
include improved filtering, sorting and searching capabilities, and a high-level
overview of the versions of all bot instances in the cluster.

#### Kubernetes support for Relay Service

The relay service will be extended to facilitate Kubernetes connections.

|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
