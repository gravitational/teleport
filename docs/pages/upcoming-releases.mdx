### 16.4.0

#### Machine ID for Terraform Cloud

Teleport will support secure joining via Terraform Cloud, allowing Machine ID
workflows to run on Terraform Cloud without shared secrets.

#### SPIFFE Federation for Workload Identity

Teleport Workload Identity will support SPIFFE Federation, allowing trust
relationships to be established between a Teleport cluster's trust domain and
trust domains managed by other SPIFFE compatible platforms. Establishing a
relationship between the trust domains enables workloads belonging to one trust
domain to validate the identity of workloads in the other trust domain, and vice
versa.

#### Multi-domain support for web applications

Teleport will support web application access where one application depends on
another. For example, you may have a web application that depends on a backend
API service, of which are separate apps protected by Teleport.

#### Okta integration status dashboard

Cluster admins will be able to get a detailed overview of the Okta integration
status in the Teleport web UI.

#### Secrets support for Kubernetes Operator

Kubernetes Operator will be able to lookup values from Kubernetes secrets for
`GithubConnector.ClientSecret` and `OIDCConnector.ClientSecret`.

### 17.0.0

#### New Nav

Teleport 17 will include navigation updates to enhance usability and
scalability of the web UI.

#### Modern Signature Algorithms

Teleport admins will have the option to use elliptic curve cryptography for the
majority of user, host, and certificate authority key material. This includes
Ed25519 SSH keys and ECDSA TLS keys, replacing the RSA keys used today.

#### AWS Identity Center integration

Teleport will integrate with AWS Identity Center to allow users to sync and
manage AWS IC group and their members and allow them to request access to AWS
IC permission sets.

#### Hardware Key support for Teleport Connect

Teleport's support for [hardware-backed private
keys](admin-guides/access-controls/guides/hardware-key-support.mdx) will be extended to
Teleport Connect.

*Delayed from Teleport 16.3.0.*

members in other Access Lists.

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
