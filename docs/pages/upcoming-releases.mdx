## Teleport

| Version | Date            |
|---------|-----------------|
| 15.2.0  | March 29, 2024  |
| 16.0.0  | May 31, 2024    |

### 15.2.0

#### New paginated APIs

Teleport's gRPC server will expose new paginated APIs for listing roles and
access requests, which will improve performance on clusters with large numbers
of these resources.

*Delayed from Teleport 15.1.0*

#### Zero-downtime web asset rollout

Teleport 15.2 changes the way that web assets are served and cached, which
will allow multiple compatible versions of the Teleport Proxy to run behind
the same load balancer.

#### Workload Identity MVP

With Teleport 15.2, Machine ID can bootstrap and issue identity to services
across multiple computing environments and organizational boundaries. Workload
Identity issues [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io/)-compatible x509 certificates that
can be used for mTLS between services.

#### Support for Kubernetes 1.29+

The Kubernetes project is deprecating the SPDY protocol for streaming commands
(`kubectl exec`, `kubectl port-forward`, etc) and replacing it with a new
websocket-based subprotocol. Teleport 15.2.0 will support the new protocol to
ensure compatibility with newer Kubernetes clusters.

#### Automatic database access requests

Both `tsh db connect` and `tsh proxy db` will offer the option to submit an
access request if the user attempts to connect to a database that they don't
already have access to.

### 16.0.0

#### Teleport VNet

Teleport 16 introduces Teleport VNet, a new feature that provides a virtual IP
subnet and DNS server that automatically proxies TCP connections to Teleport
apps over mutually authenticated tunnels.

This will allow scripts and software applications to connect to any
Teleport-protected application as if they were connected to a VPN, without the
need to manage local tunnels.

## Teleport Cloud

The key deliverables for Teleport Cloud in the next quarter:

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
