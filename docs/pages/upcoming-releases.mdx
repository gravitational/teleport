## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.

## Preview Policy

A product or feature may be marked as "Preview" if any of the following is
true.

- The product or feature is missing key functionality. For example, Microsoft
  SQL Server support for database access initially shipped without audit
  logging support.
- The product or feature has NOT been adopted by at least 2 existing customers.
- The product or feature has NOT been through a security audit.
- The documentation for the product or feature is incomplete.
- Assets (e.g. binaries) associated with the feature are not published to our

Use preview features in production if the above issues are not a concern.
