Teleport releases a new major version approximately every 4 months, and provides
security-critical support for the current and two previous major versions. With
our typical release cadence, we usually support each major version for 12
months.

## Teleport

| Version | Date                   |
|---------|------------------------|
| 18.0.0  | Week of July 7, 2025   |
| 18.1.0  | Week of August 4, 2025 |

### 18.0.0

#### Identity Activity Center

Teleport Identity Security (fka Teleport Policy) will provide an Identity Activity
Center to allow users to correlate user activity by multiple factors to facilitate
incident response. The first iteration will support integrations with GitHub, Okta
and AWS.

#### Automatic access request reviews

Teleport will provide the ability to perform automatic access request reviews based
on requested roles out of the box.

#### Multi-session MFA for Database Access

Teleport will provide a more user-friendly way to execute queries on multiple
databases when per-session MFA is enabled, without requiring MFA tap for each
connection.

#### RBAC for SAML applications

Users will be able to control access to SAML applications using role labels
similar to other Teleport-protected resources.

#### Database health checks

Teleport will support periodic connectivity checks for connected databases
and expose database health information to users via web UI and CLI/API.

### 18.1.0

#### Encrypted session recordings

Teleport will provide the ability to integrate with Hardware Security Modules
(HSMs) in order to encrypt session recordings prior to uploading them to storage.

#### VNet for SSH

Teleport VNet will add native support for SSH, enabling any SSH client to connect
to Teleport SSH servers with zero configuration. Advanced Teleport features like
per-session MFA will have first-class support for a seamless user experience.

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
