Teleport releases a new major version once per year, and provides
security-critical support for the current and previous major version. We
support each major version for 24 months.

The most recent major version of Teleport, referred to as the **current version**,
is the only major version of Teleport that will receive new features. The
previous major version, referred to as the **stable version**, will only receive
bug fixes and security patches.

### Upcoming releases

We plan to release the following versions in the coming months:

| Version | Date                       |
|---------|----------------------------|
| 18.7.0  | Week of February 09, 2026  |
| 18.8.0  | Week of March 02, 2026     |
| 19.0.0  | August 2026                |

### 18.7.0

#### Session timeline view for Identity Security

Session player for Identity Security users will receive an enhanced timeline view with
per-command session breakdown.

#### Organization-level auto-discovery for AWS EC2 instances

AWS auto-discovery will support EC2 instance enrollment from all or a subset of accounts
of an AWS organization without having to configure per-account discovery.

Organization-level discovery for other resources within AWS (RDS, EKS) as well as other
for cloud providers will follow in future releases.

#### Terraform-native flow for configuration of AWS EC2 auto-discovery

Teleport will provide in-product UX for configuring EC2 auto-discovery in a single AWS
account using terraform module.

#### Static labels for auto-discovered Windows desktops

Teleport can now be configured to apply a set of static labels to Windows
desktops that it discovers via LDAP. This is an alternative to setting labels
based on the value of LDAP attributes.

#### Access requests privilege escalation UX for AWS

Teleport users will be able to see specific IAM roles available to them when requesting
elevated access to AWS CLI/console. Future releases will extend support for specific
principal selection to access requests for other resource types as well.

#### Entra ID integration status page

Teleport users will be able to see status of the configured Entra ID integration in the
web UI.

#### Inventory UI

Teleport's web UI will include a new page showing the complete inventory of all instances
and bots connected to the cluster.

#### Managed Updates UI

Teleport's web UI will include new functionality for working with managed updates.
The UI will offer the ability to view and manage the updater configuration as well
as monitor the progress of update rollouts.

### 18.8.0

#### VNet for Linux

Teleport VNet support will be extended to Linux workstations.

*Delayed from 18.7.0.*

#### Improvements to access list creation UX

Teleport will provide guided in-product UX for creating common types of access lists
centered around granting users permissions to resources and permissions to request
access to resources.

*Delayed from 18.7.0.*

#### Split Windows CA

Teleport will introduce a new Windows CA responsible for issuing user certificates for 
Windows Desktop access. Currently the User CA issues those certificates, as they are end-user certs. 
Splitting the CAs improves Teleport's security posture by introducing a more specialized CA
and allows both CAs to be rotated independently.

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
