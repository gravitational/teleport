description: A timeline of upcoming Teleport releases.
---

Teleport releases a new major version approximately every 4 months, and provides
security-critical support for the current and two previous major versions. With
our typical release cadence, we usually support each major version for 12
months.

## Teleport

We plan to release the following versions in the coming months:

| Version | Date                   |
|---------|------------------------|
| 18.1.0  | Week of August 4, 2025 |

We continue to support the following major versions of Teleport:

| Release | Release Date      | EOL            | Minimum `tsh` version |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| v18.x   | July 3, 2025      | August 2026    | v17.0.0               |
| v17.x   | November 16, 2024 | February 2026  | v16.0.0               |
| v16.x   | June 14, 2024     | October 2025   | v15.0.0               |

### 18.1.0

#### Encrypted session recordings

Teleport will provide the ability to integrate with Hardware Security Modules
(HSMs) in order to encrypt session recordings prior to uploading them to storage.

#### VNet for SSH

Teleport VNet will add native support for SSH, enabling any SSH client to connect
to Teleport SSH servers with zero configuration. Advanced Teleport features like
per-session MFA will have first-class support for a seamless user experience.

#### Identifier-first login

Teleport will add support for identifier-first login flows. When enabled, the initial
login screen will contain only a username prompt. Users will be presented with the 
SSO connectors that apply to them after submitting their username.

#### Bound keypair joining for Machine ID

The new bound keypair join method for Machine ID is a more secure and user-friendly
alternative to token joining in both on-prem environments and cloud providers without
a delegated join method. It allows for automatic self-recovery in case of expired client
certificates and gives administrators new options to manage and automate bot joining.

#### Sailpoint SCIM integration

Teleport will support Sailpoint as a SCIM provider allowing to synchronize Sailpoint
entitlement groups with Teleport access lists.

#### Improved access requests UX

Teleport web UI will make a better distinction between just-in-time and long-term
access request UX.

## Teleport Cloud

The key deliverables for Teleport Cloud in the next quarter:

| Week of         | Description                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| August 11, 2025 | Teleport 18.1 will begin rollout on Cloud.                   |
| August 11, 2025 | Teleport 18.1 agents will begin rollout to eligible tenants. |

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
