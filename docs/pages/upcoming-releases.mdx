### 17.1.0

#### Per-session MFA via IdP

Teleport users will be able to satisfy per-session MFA checks by authenticating
with an external identity provider as an alternative to using second factors
registered with Teleport.

#### Access requests support for AWS Identity Center

AWS Identity Center integration will allow users to request short or long term
access to permission sets via Access Requests.

#### Database access for PostgreSQL via web UI

Database access users will be able to connect to PostgreSQL databases connected
to Teleport right from the web UI and use psql-style interface to query the
database.

#### Hosted email plugin for access requests

Users will be able to setup Mailgun or generic SMTP server for access request
notifications using Teleport web UI without needing to self-host the email
plugin.

#### Multi-port support for VNet

Users will be able to support multiple ports (or a range of ports) with a
single TCP application, and Teleport VNet will make all of the application's
ports accessible on the virtual network.

#### Graphical Role Editor

Teleport's web UI will include a new role editor that allows users to create
and modify roles without resorting to a raw YAML editor.

### 17.2.0

#### GitHub access

Teleport will natively support GitHub access allowing users to transparently
interact with Github with RBAC and audit logging support.

*Delayed from Teleport 17.1.0.*

#### Granular SSH port forwarding controls

Teleport will allow cluster administrators to enable local and remote port forwarding
separately rather than grouping both types of port forwarding behind a single option.

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
