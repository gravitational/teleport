Teleport releases a new major version approximately every 4 months, and provides
security-critical support for the current and two previous major versions. With
our typical release cadence, we usually support each major version for 12
months.

## Teleport

We plan to release the following versions in the coming months:

| Version | Date                      |
|---------|---------------------------|
| 18.3.0  | Week of October 13, 2025  |

We continue to support the following major versions of Teleport:

| Release | Release Date      | EOL            | Minimum `tsh` version |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| v18.x   | July 3, 2025      | August 2026    | v17.0.0               |
| v17.x   | November 16, 2024 | February 2026  | v16.0.0               |
| v16.x   | June 14, 2024     | October 2025   | v15.0.0               |

### 18.3.0

#### Web UI Workload ID

Teleport's web UI will list all workload identity resources registered in the cluster.

#### Relay Service

Teleport will ship with a new relay service that acts as a lightweight proxy service,
receiving connections from both clients and agents. 

The relay service can be used to avoid routing connections through the broader Teleport
control plane, providing the ability to optimize network flows in large or complex deployments.

#### Multi-cluster Discovery

Teleport EC2 auto-discovery will support a use-case in which multiple Teleport clusters
discover the same EC2 instances without interfering with each other.

## Teleport Cloud

The key deliverables for Teleport Cloud in the next quarter:

| Week of            | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| October 20, 2025 | Teleport 18.3 will begin rollout on Cloud.                   |
| October 20, 2025 | Teleport 18.3 agents will begin rollout to eligible tenants. |

## Production readiness

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for pre-releases and
releases.

### Pre-releases

Pre-releases of Teleport (versions with suffixes like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`)
should not be run in production environments.

Pre-releases of Teleport are great for testing new features, breaking changes,
and backwards incompatibility issues either in development or staging
environments.

### Major Releases

Major releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).0.0`.

Major releases of Teleport contain many large new features and may contain
breaking changes.

Due to the scope and quantity of changes in a major release, we encourage
deploying to staging first to verify your usage pattern has not changed.

### Minor Releases

Minor releases look like `(=teleport.major_version=).X.0`.

Minor releases of Teleport typically contain smaller features and improvements.
Minor releases can typically be deployed directly to production.

Most customers upgrade to the next major version of Teleport during the first
minor release, such as (=teleport.major_version=).1.0.

### Patch Releases

Patch releases contain small bug fixes and can typically be deployed directly
to production.
