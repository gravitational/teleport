Teleport is available in different editions to support different deployment models and feature requirements. 
This _Quick Start_ provides a brief overview of what's available and your deployment options to help you decide
what's right for your organization, large or small.

Before diving into details, the first most important thing you should know about Teleport is that it is a
secure **access platform** that protects **resources**—including servers, applications, databases, and 
devices—within a conceptual boundary called the **Teleport cluster**.

The cluster can be as simple as a single Linux server or a collection of resources distributed on a global scale.
At a minimum, the cluster provides at least one Teleport Auth Service and at least one Teleport Proxy Service.

## Get Teleport

There are many ways you can prepare a development environment for testing and evaluating Teleport features and 
performing common administrative tasks. 
For example, you can deploy Teleport:

- As a self-hosted private network consisting of physical or virtual machines, Docker containers, or in 
  a Kubernetes cluster.
- On a cloud-hosted public network using AWS EC2, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure instances or Kubernetes
  clusters.
- By enrolling and configuring infrastructure for a Teleport Team or Teleport Enterprise account in a 
  Teleport-hosted cloud.

There are getting started guides and examples of the different deployment options in other sections throughout 
the documentation. However, if you want to minimize the preparation time and management involved, you can 
start your Teleport journey by signing up for a Teleport Team account. Teleport Team offers a free trial period 
so you can learn the basics of managing your infrastructure without installing or managing the Teleport cluster 
core services—the **Teleport Auth Service** and the **Teleport Proxy Service**.
