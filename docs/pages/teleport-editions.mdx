title: Teleport Editions
description: Provides a comparison of features and products available in Teleport Community Edition and Teleport Enterprise.
---

This guide explains the editions and products that are available to Teleport
users.

Teleport includes two editions:
- **Teleport Community Edition:** An open source offering intended for demos and
  small teams.
- **Teleport Enterprise:** A fully-featured commercial offering.

Teleport Enterprise offers two deployment
options: 
- **Cloud:** The Teleport team manages the Teleport Auth Service and Teleport
  Proxy Service on the Teleport Cloud infrastructure.
- **Self-Hosted:** Teleport users deploy the Teleport Auth Service and Teleport Proxy
  Service on their own infrastructure.

Teleport Enterprise includes add-on products that provide a more complete
infrastructure identity solution, which this guide explains in more detail
below.

For information on how Teleport calculates billing metrics for product usage,
see [Usage and Billing](./usage-billing.mdx).

## Teleport Zero Trust Access

Teleport Zero Trust Access provides engineers with least-privileged access to
applications, servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, remote desktops, and
other resources across distributed infrastructure. Built on a foundation of
cryptographic identity and purpose-built for infrastructure, Teleport Zero Trust
Access uses short-lived credentials to enforcing granular access policies and
Zero-Trust principles.

Teleport Zero Trust Access is available in all Teleport editions, with some
features only available in Teleport Enterprise, and some features requiring
self-hosted deployments.

See [Usage and Billing](./usage-billing.mdx#machine-and-workload-identities) for
how Teleport calculates usage of this product in addition to Teleport Enterprise
usage.

## Management and licensing

When choosing an edition of Teleport, one consideration to make is how you plan
to manage the cluster and which available option best suits your organization.
While Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) is fully managed, Teleport Enterprise
(Self-Hosted) allows admins to customize certain aspects of their cluster for
large organizations with unique security needs.
