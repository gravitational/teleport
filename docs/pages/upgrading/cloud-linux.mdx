title: Upgrade Teleport Cloud Agents on Linux
description: Provides instructions for upgrading Teleport Cloud agents that run on Linux servers. 
---

This guide explains how to upgrade Teleport Cloud agents running on Linux
servers. On Teleport Cloud, Auth Service and Proxy Service upgrades are managed
for you. To keep agents up to date, you can either enroll them in automatic
upgrades or upgrade them manually using the method you used to install Teleport.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./overview.mdx) guide,
  which describes the sequence in which to upgrade components in your cluster.

- A Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. You can determine the current version of
  the Auth Service and Proxy Service by running the following command, where
  `mytenant` is the name of your Teleport Enterprise Cloud account. This
  requires the [`jq` CLI tool](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/):

  ```code
  $ curl -s https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.server_version'
  ```

- (!docs/pages/includes/cloud/tctl-tsh-prerequisite.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

Teleport supports automatic agent updates for systemd-based Linux distributions
using `apt`, `yum`, and `zypper` package managers. The [Automatic Update
Architecture](../architecture/agent-update-management.mdx) guide describes
how agent updating works. Automatic agent upgrades require:

- A Teleport Cloud account that supports automatic upgrades. To determine if
  your account supports automatic upgrades, run the following command, replacing
  `mytenant.teleport.sh` with the address of your Teleport Cloud account:

  ```code
  $ curl -s https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/ping | jq '.automatic_upgrades'
  true
  ```

- At least one Teleport Enterprise agent, started via systemd on a distribution
  using the `apt` or `yum` package managers. 

  So you can access each agent, we assume that each agent runs the Teleport SSH
  Service in addition to any other services. See the [Deploy Teleport Agents
  with Terraform](../enroll-resources/agents/deploy-agents-terraform.mdx) guide for an example.

## Step 1/2. Find agents to upgrade

To list agents that are not enrolled in automatic upgrades, use the `tctl
inventory ls` command with the `--upgrader=none` flag. This command also uses
the `--services` flag to constrain the search to Teleport processes running
agent services:

```code
$ tctl inventory ls \
  --services=node,kube,db,app,windows_desktop,discovery,okta \
  --upgrader=none
Server ID                            Hostname      Services Version Upgrader
------------------------------------ ------------- -------- ------- --------
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ip-10-1-6-130 Node     v13.4.5 none
```

If you have a lot of agents on different versions and want to prioritize enrolling
your oldest agents, you can limit your search using the `--older-than` filter:

```code
$ tctl inventory ls --upgrader=none --older-than=v1.2.3
Server ID                            Hostname        Services       Version Upgrader
------------------------------------ --------------- -------------- ------- --------
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 old.example.com Node           v1.1.1  none
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 teleport-proxy  Proxy          v14.3.6 none
00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 teleport-auth   Auth,Discovery v14.3.6 none
...
```

Note that the `inventory ls` command will also list `teleport-auth` and `teleport-proxy` services.
You do not need to update these services or enroll them in automatic updates.
Teleport Cloud manages updates for these services.

When you enroll each agent in automatic updates in the next section, you can
run the following commands to fetch the hostname for each agent and access it
via Teleport. 

For each agent ID returned by the `tctl inventory ls` command, copy the ID and
run the following `tctl` command to access the host via `tsh`:

```code
$ HOST=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
$ USER=root
$ tsh ssh "${USER?}@${HOST?}"
```

You can then follow the steps in the next section on each agent to enroll it in
automatic upgrades.

## Step 2/2. Enroll agents in automatic upgrades

Complete the following instructions on each agent you would like to enroll into
automatic upgrades:

1. Ensure the Teleport repository is added and Teleport Enterprise is installed.

   To verify if the Teleport repository was added to the system, check if either of
   the follow files exists:
   
   ```code
   $ ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/teleport.list
   # or
   $ ls /etc/yum.repos.d/teleport.repo
   ```

   The upgrader checks the repository for available releases, so make sure that
   it is up to date.

1. If the repository was added, make sure the Teleport binary installed on the
   agent can run the automatic upgrader:

   ```code
   $ which teleport-upgrade || echo "Install the upgrader"
   Install the upgrader
   ```

1. If the Teleport repository is not found, or the Teleport binary you installed
   does not include the upgrader, add the appropriate repository and reinstall
   Teleport:

   (!docs/pages/includes/cloud/install-linux-cloud.mdx!)

1. If you changed the agent user to run as non-root, create
   `/etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule` and grant ownership to your Teleport user.
   Otherwise, you can skip this step:

   ```code
   $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/
   $ sudo touch /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
   $ sudo chown <your-teleport-user> /etc/teleport-upgrade.d/schedule
   ```

1. Verify that the upgrader can see your version endpoint by checking for
   updates:

   ```code
   $ sudo teleport-upgrade dry-run
   ```
   
   You should see one of the following messages, depending on the target version
   you are currently serving:
   
   ```text
   no upgrades available (1.2.3 == 1.2.3)
   an upgrade is available (1.2.3 -> 2.3.4)
   ```

   The upgrader may display warnings about not having a valid upgrade schedule.
   This is expected immediately after install as the maintenance schedule might
   not be exported yet.

1. Ensure that the upgrader is running:

   ```code
   $ sudo systemctl status teleport-upgrade
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If the agent is not automatically updated, you can invoke the upgrader manually
and look at its logs:

```code
$ sudo teleport-upgrade run
```

To suspend automatic upgrades, disable the systemd timer:

```code
$ sudo systemctl disable --now teleport-upgrade.timer
```

To enable and start the systemd timer after suspending:

```code
$ sudo systemctl enable --now teleport-upgrade.timer
```
