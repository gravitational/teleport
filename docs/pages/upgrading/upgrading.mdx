The guides in this section show you how to upgrade Teleport to a more recent
version.

Read the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](overview.mdx) to
understand how to upgrade components in your Teleport cluster while ensuring
compatibility between all components.  For Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) users, see
[Cloud Cluster Updates](cloud-cluster-updates.mdx) for details on how this is
managed for you.

If you have a Teleport Enterprise (Cloud) account, you **must** [set up Managed
Teleport Agent Updates](agent-managed-updates.mdx) to ensure that
the version of Teleport running on agents is always compatible with that of the
Teleport cluster. You can also set up automatic agent upgrades in a self-hosted
Enterprise cluster.

For more information about upgrading Teleport manually, read
[Upgrading Manually](upgrading-manual.mdx).

For more information about client tools managed updates, read the
[Teleport Client Tools Managed Updates](client-tools-managed-updates.mdx).

You can find more information regarding the automatic updates architecture in the
[Agent Update Management](../reference/architecture/agent-update-management.mdx) page.
