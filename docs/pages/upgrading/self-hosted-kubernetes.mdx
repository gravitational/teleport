title: Upgrade Self-Hosted Teleport Clusters on Kubernetes
description: Provides instructions for upgrading self-hosted Teleport clusters that run on Kubernetes. 
---

This guide explains how to upgrade self-hosted Teleport clusters running on
Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the [Upgrading Compatibility Overview](./overview.mdx) guide,
  which describes the sequence in which to upgrade components of your cluster.
- A self-hosted Teleport cluster in which the Auth Service and Proxy Service run
  on Kubernetes. This guide assumes that you have deployed the Teleport cluster
  using the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl-tsh-prerequisite.mdx!)
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

This guide assumes that you have configured the `teleport-cluster` Helm chart
with a values file called `values.yaml`, and that your `teleport-cluster`
release is called `teleport-cluster`.

## Step 1/2. Shrink the Auth Service pool

You must reduce the number of Auth Service instances to one in order to ensure a
consistent cluster state during the upgrade.

Ensure that your `teleport-cluster` values file includes the following
configuration:

```yaml
auth:
  highAvailability:
    replicaCount: 1
```

Once you have completed this guide and upgraded the cluster, you can configure
your cluster for high availability again.

## Step 2/2. Upgrade the Auth Service and Proxy Service

Run the following commands to upgrade Auth Service and Proxy Service instances
running on Kubernetes.

1. Update the Teleport Helm chart repository so you can install the latest
   version of the `teleport-cluster` chart:

    (!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/helm/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

1. Upgrade the Helm release:

    ```code
    $ helm upgrade teleport-cluster teleport/teleport-cluster \
      --version=<Var name="(=teleport.version=)" /> \
      --values=values.yaml
    ```

The `teleport-cluster` Helm chart automatically waits for the previous version
of the Proxy Service to stop responding to requests before running a new version
of the Auth Service.

## Step 3/3. Upgrade agents

Run the following commands to upgrade Teleport agents running on Kubernetes.

1. Update the Teleport Helm chart repository so you can install the latest
   version of the `teleport-kube-agent` chart:

      (!docs/pages/includes/kubernetes-access/helm/helm-repo-add.mdx!)

1. Upgrade the Helm release:

   ```code
   $ helm -n <Var name="teleport" /> upgrade <Var name="teleport-agent" /> teleport/teleport-kube-agent \
     --values=values.yaml \
     --version=<Var name="(=teleport.version=)" />
   ```
