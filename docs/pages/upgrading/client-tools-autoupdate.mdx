title: Teleport Client Tool Automatic Updates
description: Explains how to use Teleport client tools (`tsh` and `tctl`) auto-updates.
---

This documentation explains how to keep Teleport client tools like `tsh` and `tctl` up-to-date.
Updates can be automatic or self-managed, ensuring tools are secure, free from bugs,
and compatible with your Teleport cluster. Available in versions: 17.0.1, 16.4.10, and 15.4.24.

Why keep client tools updated?

- **Security**: Updates deliver patches for known vulnerabilities.
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved issues are pushed to endpoints.
- **Compatibility**: Avoid manual understanding of [Teleport component compatibility rules](overview.mdx#component-compatibility).

## How it works

When you run `tsh login`, the tsh tool will check if updates are enabled for your cluster.
If your client version differs from the cluster's required version, it will:

1. Download the updated version.
2. Store it in `~/.tsh/bin`.
3. Validate the binary with a checksum.
4. Re-execute using the updated version (with the same environment variables).

### Key features

**Binary Management**: Original binaries are preserved, and updates are stored separately.
Updates are installed in the `$TELEPORT_HOME/.tsh/bin/` folder (if `TELEPORT_HOME` is not defined, the home folder is used).
When client tools (`tctl` or `tsh`) are executed from any other path, they consistently check for binaries in the update
folder and re-execute them if found.

**Validation**: Downloaded packages are verified with a hash sum to ensure integrity.
Package downloads are directed to the `cdn.teleport.dev` endpoint and depend on the operating system,
platform, and edition. The edition must be identified by the original client tools binary.
The URL pattern is as follows:
- `https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-{ent-}vX.Y.Z-{linux,darwin,windows}-{amd64,arm64,arm,386}-{fips-}bin.{tar.gz,pkg,zip}`
- `https://cdn.teleport.dev/teleport-{ent-}vX.Y.Z-{linux,darwin,windows}-{amd64,arm64,arm,386}-{fips-}bin.{tar.gz,pkg,zip}.sha256`

**Concurrency**: Tools use a locking mechanism to enable smooth operation during updates.
Only one process can acquire the lock to update client tools, while other processes wait for the lock to be released.
If the first process cancels the update, the next process in line will initiate the update.

## Configuring client tool automatic updates

### Using environment variables
Values:
- `X.Y.Z`: Use a specific version.
- `off`: Disable updates.

An environment variable `TELEPORT_TOOLS_VERSION` can be used as an emergency workaround for a known issue,
pinning to a specific version in CI/CD, for debugging, or for manual updates.

During re-execution, child process will inherit all environment variables and flags. To prevent infinite loops
only version environment variable will be overridden to `TELEPORT_TOOLS_VERSION=off`.

Example of self-managed auto-update by setting the version with environment variable:
```bash
$ TELEPORT_TOOLS_VERSION=17.0.5 tctl version
Update progress: [▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒] (Ctrl-C to cancel update)
Teleport v17.0.5 git:v17.0.5-0-g7cc4c2a go1.23.4
````

### Using `tctl`

To enable or disable client tools automatic updates in the cluster, use the following command:

```code
$ tctl autoupdate client-tools enable
client tools auto update mode has been changed

$ tctl autoupdate client-tools disable
client tools auto update mode has been changed
```

To set or remove the target version for automatic updates for all client tools:

```code
$ tctl autoupdate client-tools target X.Y.Z
client tools auto update target version has been set

$ tctl autoupdate client-tools target --clear
client tools auto update target version has been cleared
```

If the target version is cleared, the cluster version will be used automatically, eliminating the need for manual
updates each time the cluster version is upgraded.

The `status` command retrieves the target version and mode configured for the logged-in cluster.
To use an unauthenticated endpoint for this configuration, include the `--proxy` flag.

```code
$ tctl autoupdate client-tools status --format json
{
    "mode": "enabled",
    "target_version": "X.Y.Z"
}

$ tctl autoupdate client-tools status --proxy proxy.example.com --format json
{
    "mode": "enabled",
    "target_version": "X.Y.Z"
}
```

### Using resource definitions

To enable client tools automatic updates in cluster, first create a file named `autoupdate_config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind: autoupdate_config
metadata:
  name: autoupdate-config
spec:
  tools:
    mode: enabled
```

And write resource data to the cluster `tctl create -f autoupdate_config.yaml`, after that any new `tsh` login must
check the target version and initiate downloading desired version to install in Teleport home folder.

The next resource is responsible for setting target version `autoupdate_version.yaml`.

```yaml
kind: autoupdate_version
metadata:
  name: autoupdate-version
spec:
  tools:
    target_version: X.Y.Z
```

Create the resource using `tctl create -f autoupdate_version.yaml`.
If the `autoupdate_version` resource hasn't been created yet, the cluster version will be used as the default target version.

<Admonition type="note">
    - For self-hosted clusters, automatic updates are disabled by default but can be enabled.
    - Cloud clusters are automatically enrolled in updates, managed by the Teleport Cloud team.
    - For clusters with multiple root versions, use self-managed updates to avoid frequent version switching.
</Admonition>

## Determining a client tool version

To determine the version required to operate with the cluster, during the login process, `tsh` queries from the
unauthenticated proxy discovery `/v1/webapi/find` endpoint. If `.auto_update.tools_auto_update` is enabled, the
client tools must initiate the installation of the version specified in `.auto_update.tools_version`.

For manual updates, when scheduling updates at specific times or using custom CDN mirrors or with self-build packages,
you can disable auto-update via configuration. In this case, you can monitor the tool's version separately
or pair it with the `TELEPORT_TOOLS_VERSION=off` environment variable.

```bash
$ curl https://proxy.example.com/v1/webapi/find | jq .auto_update
{
    "tools_auto_update": true,
    "tools_version": "X.Y.Z",
}
```
