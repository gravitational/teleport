Since Teleport is a distributed system with a number of services that run on
potentially many hosts, you should take care when upgrading the cluster to
ensure that all components remain compatible.

This guide provides an overview of how to upgrade the components in your
Teleport cluster while preserving compatibility.

## Component compatibility

(!docs/pages/includes/compatibility.mdx!)

You can think of Teleport cluster components in three tiers:
1. The Auth Service is expected to be the newest component in the cluster.
   For this reason it should always be the first component that is upgraded.
2. The Proxy Service is expected to run a version less than or equal to the
   Auth Service. The Proxy Service should never run a version newer than the
   Auth Service.
3. Other Teleport agents (SSH Service, Database Service, etc.) should always
   run a version less than or equal to the Proxy Service.

In Teleport Enterprise Cloud, we manage the Auth Service and Proxy Service for
you. You can determine the current version of these services by running the
following command, where `mytenant` is the name of your Teleport Enterprise
Cloud tenant:

```code
$ curl -s https://mytenant.teleport.sh/webapi/find | jq '.server_version'
```

## Upgrading a self-hosted Teleport cluster

Because of the component compatibility guarantees we described in the previous
section, you must adhere to the following sequence when upgrading a self-hosted
Teleport cluster.

<Admonition type="warning">
  If you are upgrading more then one major version, you must repeat the
  following steps for each major version until you reach your target version.
  For example, if your cluster is on v15 and you wish to upgrade to v18, you
  must first follow the sequence below for v16, then v17, before finally upgrading
  to v18. You must not upgrade directly from v15 to v18.
</Admonition>

1. Back up your Teleport cluster state as a precaution against any unforeseen
   incidents while upgrading the Auth Service, which may perform data
   migrations on its backend. Follow the instructions in [Backup and
   Restore](../zero-trust-access/management/operations/backup-restore.mdx).
1. Upgrade all **Auth Service** instances to the **target version first**.
   Auth Service instances may be upgraded in any sequence or at the same time. After
   the upgrade **confirm** that the cluster is in a healthy state before continuing.
1. After all Auth Service instances are running the target version, upgrade Proxy Service instances
   to the same version as the Auth Service. Proxy Service instances are
   stateless and can be upgraded in any sequence or at the same time. After the
   upgrade **confirm** that the cluster is in a healthy state before continuing.
1. After all Proxy Service instances are running the target version, upgrade
   your Teleport Agents to the same version as the Auth Service. You can upgrade
   agents in any sequence or at the same time. After the upgrade **confirm**
   that the cluster is in a healthy state before continuing.
1. Upgrade your Teleport clients and plugins (tctl, tsh, tbot, terraform-provider, event-handler, etc.).

By following this process, your agents will never get ahead of your control
plane components (even within the same major/patch version), ensuring that all
expected APIs and migrations will be available by the time the agents upgrade.

## Upgrading multiple Teleport clusters

When upgrading multiple Teleport clusters with a trust relationship, you must
upgrade in the following sequence to avoid compatibility issues.

You must upgrade all clusters one major version at a time. For example, if you
would like to upgrade your clusters from v10 to v12, you must follow the
sequence below to upgrade clusters from v10 to v11, then repeat the sequence to
upgrade from v10 to v11.

1. Upgrade the root cluster—that is, the cluster that other clusters
   trust—first.
1. Verify the upgrade was successful.
1. Upgrade the trusted leaf clusters.

## Downgrading major versions

In order to safely downgrade from one major version to another, i.e. from v17 to v16,
you must restore the Teleport backend to the back up taken prior to upgrading. First,
roll back all components to the exact version they were running prior to the upgrade in
reverse order of the upgrade sequence above until only the Auth Service instances are running
the new major version. Then stop the Auth Service and follow the
[Backup and Restore](../zero-trust-access/management/operations/backup-restore.mdx) guidance
to restore the backend to a point in time prior to the upgrade. Once the backup has been
restored, downgrade the Auth Service instances to the exact version of Teleport
they were running prior to the upgrade attempt, then start them again.
