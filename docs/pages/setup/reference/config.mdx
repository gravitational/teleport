## teleport.yaml

Teleport uses the YAML file format for configuration. A full configuration reference
file is shown below, this provides comments and all available options for `teleport.yaml`
By default, it is stored in `/etc/teleport.yaml`.

(!docs/pages/includes/backup-warning.mdx!)

This document aims to be a reference rather than a starting point for a real cluster. To
get a good starting file, run `teleport configure -o teleport.yaml`.

```yaml
# By default, this file should be stored in /etc/teleport.yaml

# Configuration file version. The current version is "v2".
version: v2

# This section of the configuration file applies to all teleport
# services.
teleport:
    # nodename allows one to assign an alternative name this node can be reached by.
    # by default it's equal to hostname
    nodename: graviton

    # Data directory where Teleport daemon keeps its data.
    # See "Filesystem Layout" for more details
    # (https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guide/#filesystem-layout).

    #pid_file: /var/run/teleport.pid

    # Invitation token used to join a cluster. it is not used on
    # subsequent starts
    auth_token: xxxx-token-xxxx

    # Optional CA pin of the auth server. This enables more secure way of adding new
    # nodes to a cluster. See "Adding Nodes to the Cluster"
    # (https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guide/#adding-nodes-to-the-cluster).

    # When running in multi-homed or NATed environments Teleport nodes need
    # to know which IP it will be reachable at by other nodes
    #
    # This value can be specified as FQDN e.g. host.example.com
    advertise_ip: 10.1.0.5

    # Auth Server address and port to connect to. If you configure teleport auth to run in High
    # Availability configuration the address should point to a Load Balancer.
    # If adding a node located behind NAT, use the Proxy URL. e.g.
    #  auth_servers:
    #     - teleport-proxy.example.com:443
    auth_servers:
        - 10.1.0.5:3025
