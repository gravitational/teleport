title: Teleport Diagnostics
description: How to use Teleport's health, readiness, profiling, and monitoring endpoints.
---

Teleport provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring purposes. They are disabled by
default, but you can enable them using the `--diag-addr` flag when running
`teleport start`:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --diag-addr=127.0.0.1:3000
```

Now you can collect monitoring information from several endpoints.

## `/healthz`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/healthz` endpoint responds with a body of
`{"status":"ok"}` and an HTTP 200 OK status code if the process is running.

This is a simple check, suitable for determining if the Teleport process is
still running.

## `/readyz`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz` endpoint is similar to `/healthz`, but its
response includes information about the state of the process.

The response body is a JSON object of the form:

```
{ "status": "a status message here"}
```

### `/readyz` and heartbeats

If a Teleport component fails to execute its heartbeat procedure, it will enter
a degraded state. Teleport will begin recovering from this state when a
heartbeat completes successfully.

The first successful heartbeat will transition Teleport into a recovering state.

A second consecutive successful heartbeat will cause Teleport to transition to
the OK state, so long as at least 10 seconds have elapsed since the
first successful heartbeat.

Teleport heartbeats run every 5 seconds. This means that depending on the timing
of heartbeats, it can take 10-20 seconds after connectivity is restored for
`/readyz` to start reporting healthy again.

### Status codes

The status code of the response can be one of:

- HTTP 200 OK: Teleport is operating normally
- HTTP 503 Service Unavailable: Teleport has encountered a connection error and
  is running in a degraded state. This happens when a Teleport heartbeat fails.
- HTTP 400 Bad Request: Teleport is either entering its initial startup phase or
  has begun recovering from a degraded state.

The same state information is also available via the `process_state` metric
under the `/metrics` endpoint.

## `/debug/pprof`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/` endpoint is Go's standard pprof
profiler. This endpoint is only available if the `--debug` (or `-d`) flag is
supplied (in addition to `--diag-addr`).

## `/metrics`

The `http://127.0.0.1:3000/metrics` endpoint serves the internal metrics
Teleport is tracking. It is compatible with
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) collectors.

The following metrics are available:

While Teleport Cloud does not expose monitoring endpoints, you can use the following metrics to monitor your Teleport Nodes.
