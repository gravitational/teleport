description: Reference of Teleport Audit Events and Session Records
---

Teleport logs SSH, Kubernetes, and database events into its audit log. There are
two components of the audit log:

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["enterprise", "oss"]} label="Self-Hosted">


1. **Cluster Events:** Teleport logs events like successful user logins along
   with metadata like remote IP address, time, and the session ID.
2. **Recorded Sessions:** Every SSH or Kubernetes shell session is recorded and
   can be replayed later. By default, the recording is done by Teleport Nodes,
   but can be configured to be done by the proxy.

You can use
[Enhanced Session Recording with BPF](../../server-access/guides/bpf-session-recording.mdx)
to get even more comprehensive audit logs with advanced security.

</Notice>

Refer to the
["Audit Log" section](../../architecture/authentication.mdx#audit-log) in the
Teleport architecture guide to learn more about how the audit log and Session
Recording are designed.

## Events

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["enterprise", "oss"]} label="Self-Hosted">

Teleport supports multiple storage backends for storing audit events. The `dir`
backend uses the local filesystem of an Auth Service host.

For High Availability configurations, users can refer to our
[DynamoDB](./backends.mdx#dynamodb) or [Firestore](./backends.mdx#firestore)
chapters for information on how to configure the SSH events and recorded
sessions to be stored on network storage. 

It is even possible to store audit logs in multiple places at the same time.
For more information on how to configure the audit log, refer to the `storage`
section of the example configuration file in the
[Teleport Configuration Reference](./config.mdx).

Let's examine the Teleport audit log using the `dir` backend. The event log is
stored in the `data_dir` under `log` directory, usually `/var/lib/teleport/log`.
Each day is represented as a file:

```code
$ ls -l /var/lib/teleport/log/

# total 104
# -rw-r----- 1 root root  31638 Jan 22 20:00 2017-01-23.00:00:00.log
# -rw-r----- 1 root root  91256 Jan 31 21:00 2017-02-01.00:00:00.log
# -rw-r----- 1 root root  15815 Feb 32 22:54 2017-02-03.00:00:00.log
```

Teleport Cloud manages the storage of audit logs for you. You can access your
audit logs via the Teleport Web UI by clicking:

**Activity** > **Audit Log**

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Audit logs use JSON format. They are human readable but can also be
programmatically parsed. Each line represents an event and has the following
format:

```javascript
{
    // Event type. See below for the list of all possible event types.
    "event": "session.start",
    // A unique ID for the event log. Useful for  deduplication.
    "uid": "59cf8d1b-7b36-4894-8e90-9d9713b6b9ef",
    // Teleport user name
    "user": "ekontsevoy",
    // OS login
    "login": "root",
    // Server namespace. This field is reserved for future use.
    "namespace": "default",
    // Unique server ID
    "server_id": "f84f7386-5e22-45ff-8f7d-b8079742e63f",
    // Server Labels
    "server_labels": {
      "datacenter": "us-east-1",
      "label-b": "x"
    }
    // Session ID. Can be used to replay the session.
    "sid": "8d3895b6-e9dd-11e6-94de-40167e68e931",
    // Address of the SSH node
    "addr.local": "10.5.l.15:3022",
    // Address of the connecting client (user)
    "addr.remote": "73.223.221.14:42146",
    // Terminal size
    "size": "80:25",
    // Timestamp
    "time": "2017-02-03T06:54:05Z"
}
```

## Event types

The possible event types are:

| Event Type | Description |
| - | - |
| auth | Authentication attempt. Adds the following fields: `{"success": "false", "error": "access denied"}` |
| session.start | Started an interactive shell session. |
| session.end | An interactive shell session has ended. |
| session.join | A new user has joined the existing interactive shell session. |
| session.leave | A user has left the session. |
| session.disk | A list of files opened during the session. *Requires Enhanced Session Recording*. |
| session.network | A list of network connections made during the session.  *Requires Enhanced Session Recording*. |
| session.command | A list of commands ran during the session.  *Requires Enhanced Session Recording*. |
| exec | Remote command has been executed via SSH, like `tsh ssh root@node ls /`. The following fields will be logged: `{"command": "ls /", "exitCode": 0, "exitError": ""}` |
| scp | Remote file copy has been executed. The following fields will be logged: `{"path": "/path/to/file.txt", "len": 32344, "action": "read" }` |
| resize | Terminal has been resized. |
| user.login | A user logged into web UI or via tsh. The following fields will be logged: `{"user": "alice@example.com", "method": "local"}` . |
| app.session.start | A user accessed an application |
| app.session.chunk | A record of activity during an app session |

## Recorded sessions
In addition to logging `session.start` and `session.end` events, Teleport also
records the entire stream of bytes going to/from the standard input and standard
output of an SSH session.

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["enterprise", "oss"]} label="Self-Hosted">

Teleport can store the recorded sessions in an [AWS S3 bucket](./backends.mdx#s3)
or in a local filesystem (including NFS).

The recorded sessions are stored as raw bytes in the `sessions` directory under
`log`. Each session is a binary protobuf-encoded stream of data.

You can replay recorded sessions using the [`tsh play`](./cli.mdx#tsh-play) command or the Web
UI.

For example, replay a session via CLI:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy play 4c146ec8-eab6-11e6-b1b3-40167e68e931
```

Print the session events in JSON to stdout:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy play 4c146ec8-eab6-11e6-b1b3-40167e68e931 --format=json
```
