## Introduction

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

A Teleport administrator has two tools to configure a Teleport cluster:

- The [configuration file](./config.mdx) is used for static configuration
  settings such as the cluster name.
- The [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) admin tool is used for configuring the Teleport
  Auth Service, and can be used to manage dynamic records like Teleport users.

</TabItem>
<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">

A Teleport administrator can configure a Teleport cluster by using the
[`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) admin tool to manage dynamic records like Teleport
users.

### `tctl` concepts

[`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) has convenient sub-commands for dynamic
configuration, such as `tctl users` or `tctl nodes`. 

For more advanced management tasks, like connecting clusters together or
troubleshooting trust, [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl) offers the more powerful,
lower-level CLI interface called `resources`.

The concept is borrowed from the REST programming pattern. A cluster is composed
of different objects (i.e., resources) and there are three common operations
that can be performed on them: `get` , `create` , and `remove` .

A resource is defined as a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file.
Every resource in Teleport has three required fields:

- `kind`: The type of resource
- `name`: A required field in the `metadata` to uniquely identify the resource
- `version`: The version of the resource format

Everything else is resource specific and any component of a Teleport cluster can
be manipulated with just three CLI commands:

| Command | Description | Examples |
| - | - | - |
| [`tctl get`](./cli.mdx#tctl-get) | Get one or multiple resources. | `tctl get users` or `tctl get user/joe` |
| [`tctl rm`](./cli.mdx#tctl-rm) | Delete a resource by type/name. | `tctl rm user/joe` |
| [`tctl create`](./cli.mdx#tctl-create) | Create a new resource from a YAML file. Use the `-f` flag to update existing resources. | `tctl create -f joe.yaml` |

  title="YAML Format"

  By default Teleport, uses [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) to
  describe resources. YAML is a human-readable alternative to JSON or XML, but
  it's sensitive to white space. Pay attention to spaces versus tabs.

</Admonition>

### `tctl` example

Here's an example of a YAML resource definition for a user named `joe`. It can
be retrieved by executing `tctl get user/joe`.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  roles: admin
  status:
    # Users can be temporarily locked in a Teleport system, but this
    # functionality is reserved for internal use for now.
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  traits:
    # These are "allowed logins" which are usually specified as the
    # last argument to `tctl users add`.
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # Any resource in Teleport can automatically expire.
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # For internal use only
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

<Admonition

  Some of the fields you will see when printing resources are used only internally and are not meant to be changed. Others are reserved for future use.

## Dynamic resources

Here's the list of resources currently exposed via [`tctl`](./cli.mdx#tctl):

| Resource Kind | Description |
| - | - |
| [user](#user) | A user record in the internal Teleport user DB. |
| [role](#role) | A role assumed by interactive and non-interactive users. |
| connector | Authentication connectors for [Single Sign-On](../../enterprise/sso.mdx) (SSO) for SAML, OIDC and Github. |
| node | A registered SSH node. The same record is displayed via `tctl nodes ls` |
| cluster | A trusted cluster. See [here](../../setup/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) for more details on connecting clusters together. |

**Examples:**

```code
# List all connectors:
$ tctl get connectors

# Dump a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl get saml/okta

# Delete a SAML connector called "okta":
$ tctl rm saml/okta

# Delete an OIDC connector called "gworkspace":
$ tctl rm oidc/gworkspace

# Delete a github connector called "myteam":
$ tctl rm github/myteam

# Delete a local user called "admin":
$ tctl rm users/admin
```

<Admonition type="note">
  Although `tctl get connectors` will show you every connector, when working with an individual connector you must use the correct `kind`, such as `saml` or `oidc`. You can see each connector's `kind` at the top of its YAML output from `tctl get connectors`.

### User

Teleport supports interactive local users, non-interactive local users (bots)
and single-sign on users that are represented as a resource.

```yaml
kind: user
version: v2
metadata:
  name: joe
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles assigned to this user
  roles:
  - admin
  # status sets user temporarily locked in a Teleport system, for example
  # when users exceed predefined amount of failed login attempts
  status:
    is_locked: false
    lock_expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    locked_time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # traits are key, list of values pairs assigned to a user resource.
  # Traits can be used in role templates as variables.
  traits:
    logins:
    - joe
    - root
  # expires, if not empty, sets automatic expiry of the resource
  expires: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
  # created_by is a system property that tracks
  # identity of the author of this user resource.
  created_by:
    time: 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
    user:
      name: builtin-Admin
```

### Role

Interactive and non-interactive users (bots) assume one or many roles.
Roles govern access to databases, SSH servers, kubernetes clusters, and web apps.

```yaml
---
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  # options specify connection , in case if user has multiple non-default
  # conflicting options, teleport chooses the least permissive value.
  options:
    # max_session_ttl defines the TTL (time to live) of certificates
    # issued to the users with this role.
    max_session_ttl: 8h
    # forward_agent controls whether SSH agent forwarding is allowed
    forward_agent: true
    # port_forwarding controls whether TCP port forwarding is allowed for SSH
    port_forwarding: true
    # client_idle_timeout determines if SSH sessions to cluster nodes are
    # forcefully terminated after no activity from a client (idle client).
    # it overrides the global cluster setting. examples: "30m", "1h" or "1h30m"
    client_idle_timeout: never
    # Determines if the clients will be forcefully disconnected when their
    # certificates expire in the middle of an active session.
    # It overrides the global cluster setting.
    disconnect_expired_cert: no
    # max_sessions is total number of session channels that can be established
    # across a single connection. Setting it to 10 matches OpenSSH default behavior.
    max_sessions: 10
    # permit_x11_forwarding allows users to use X11 forwarding with openssh
    # clients and servers through the proxy
    permit_x11_forwarding: true
    # require_session_mfa require per-session MFA for any owner of this role
    require_session_mfa: true
    # lock sets locking mode for user of this role,
    # valid values are "strict" or "best_effort"
    lock: strict
    # enterprise-only request_access field is either 'always' or 'reason'. If set to always, it instructs
    # tsh or the web UI clients to always create an access request on login. If it is
    # set to 'reason', the user will be required to indicate why they are
    # generating the access request.
    request_access: reason
    # the `request_prompt` field can be used to tell the user what should
    # be supplied in the request reason field.
    request_prompt: Please provide your ticket ID
    # enterprise-only max_connections field sets a limit of concurrent sessions within a
    # cluster. This setting slows down Teleport performance because it has to track
    # connections cluster-wide.
    max_connections: 2
    # Specify whether or not to record the user's desktop sessions.
    # Desktop session recording is enabled if one or more of the user's
    # roles has enabled recording. Defaults to true if unspecified.
    # Desktop sessions will never be recorded if auth_service.session_recording
    # is set to 'off' in teleport.yaml or if the cluster's session_recording_config
    # resource has set 'mode: off'.
    record_sessions:
      desktop: true
    # Specify whether clipboard sharing should be allowed with the
    # remote desktop (requires a supported browser). Defaults to true
    # if unspecified. If one or more of the user's roles has disabled
    # the clipboard, then it will be disabled.
    desktop_clipboard: true

  # The allow section declares a list of resource/verb combinations that are
  # allowed for the users of this role. By default, nothing is allowed.
  allow:
    # The logins array defines the OS/UNIX logins a user is allowed to use.
    # both strings and template variables are supported in this field
    logins: [root, '{{internal.logins}}']

    # node_labels: a user with this role will be allowed to connect to
    # SSH nodes, which labels match expressions below.
    node_labels:

      # the wildcard ('*') means "any node"
      '*': '*'
      # a list of alternative options:
      'region': ['us-west-1', 'eu-central-1']
      # regular expressions start with ^ and end with $
      # Teleport uses golang regexp syntax.
      # of the list example above can be expressed as:
      'reg': '^us-west-1|eu-central-1$'

    # kubernetes_groups specifies Kubernetes groups a user with this role will assume.
    # You can refer to a SAML/OIDC trait via the "external" property bag.
    # This allows you to specify Kubernetes group membership in an identity manager:
    kubernetes_groups: ["system:masters", "{{external.trait_name}}"]

    # kubernetes_users is an optional field that specifies kubernetes users
    # this role can assume.
    kubernetes_users: ['IAM#{{external.foo}};']

    # kubernetes_labels: a user with this role will be allowed to connect to
    # k8s clusters, which labels match expressions below.
    kubernetes_labels:
      # A user can only access prod environments
      'env': 'prod'
      # User can access any region in us-west, e.g us-west-1, us-west-2

    # aws_role_arns allows a user with this role to assume AWS roles when
    # accessing AWS console using UI or AWS API using CLI
    aws_role_arns:

      - 'arn:aws:iam::0987654321:role/example-role'

    # impersonate allows a user with this role to issue certificates on behalf
    # of other users and roles matching expressions below
    impersonate:
      users: ['*']
      roles: ['jenkins']

    # review_requests allows a user holding this role
    # to approve or deny access requests
    review_requests:
      roles: ['dbadmin']

    # request allows a user user request roles matching
    # expressions below
    request:
      # the `roles` list can be a mixture of literals and wildcard matchers
      roles: ['common', 'dev-*']
      # thresholds specifies minimum amount of approvers and deniers,

      thresholds:
        # requires at least two qualifying approvers and at least one denier.
        - approve: 2
          deny: 1

      # the `claims_to_roles` mapping works the same as it does in
      # the OIDC connector, with the added benefit that the roles being mapped to
      # can also be matchers. the below mapping says that users with
      # the claims `groups: admins` can request any role in the system.
      claims_to_roles:
        - claim: 'projects'
          # matches all group names with a leading 'product-'
          value: '^product-(.*)$'
          # generates a role name from the value capture
          roles: ['$1-admin']

      # Teleport can attach annotations to pending access requests. these
      # annotations may be literals, or be variable interpolation expressions,
      # effectively creating a means for propagating selected claims from an
      # external identity provider to the plugin system.
      annotations:
        foo: ['bar']
        groups: ['{{external.groups}}']
