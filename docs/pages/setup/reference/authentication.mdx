Teleport authenticates users with an identity provider via **authentication
connectors**. There are three types of authentication connectors.

## Local (no authentication connector)

Local authentication is used to authenticate against a local Teleport user
database. This database is managed by the [`tctl users`](./cli.mdx#tctl-users-add)
command. Teleport also supports second-factor authentication (2FA) for the local
connector. There are several possible values (types) of 2FA:

- `otp` is the default. It implements [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)
  standard. You can use [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator)
  or [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) or any other TOTP client.
- `u2f` implements the [U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal\_2nd_Factor)
  standard for utilizing hardware (USB) keys for the second factor. You can use [YubiKeys](https://www.yubico.com/),
  [SoloKeys](https://solokeys.com/) or any other hardware token which implements the FIDO U2F standard.
- `on` enables both TOTP and U2F, and all local users are required to have at least one 2FA device registered.
- `optional` enables both TOTP and U2F but makes it optional for users. Local users that register a 2FA device will be prompted for it during login. This option is useful when you need to gradually enable 2FA usage before switching the value to `on`.
- `off` turns off second-factor authentication.


You can modify these settings in the static config `teleport.yaml`  or using dynamic configuration resources:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Static Config (self-hosted)">
  ```yaml
  auth_service:
    authentication:
      type: local
      second_factor: off
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Dynamic resources (all editions)">
  Create a file `cap.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  kind: cluster_auth_preference
  metadata:
    name: cluster-auth-preference
  spec:
    type: local
    u2f:
      app_id: 'https://example.teleport.sh'
      facets:
      - 'https://example.teleport.sh:443'
      - 'https://example.teleport.sh'
      - 'example.teleport.sh:443'
      - 'example.teleport.sh'
  version: v2
  ```

  Create a resource:

  ```code
  $ tctl create -f cap.yaml
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
  
<Admonition type="note">
  SSO users can also register 2FA devices, but Teleport will not prompt them for 2FA during login. Login 2FA for SSO users should be handled by the SSO provider.
</Admonition>

## GitHub

This connector implements GitHub's OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. Please refer to GitHub's documentation on [Creating an OAuth App](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/)
to learn how to create and register an OAuth app.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml` :

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: github
```

See [Github OAuth 2.0](../admin/github-sso.mdx) for details on how to configure it.

## SAML

<Notice type="note">
You need the Enterprise edition of Teleport for this option.
</Notice>

This connector type implements SAML authentication. It can be configured against any external identity manager like Okta or Auth0. This feature is only available for Teleport Enterprise.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml` :

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: saml
```

### OIDC

<Notice type="note">
You need the Enterprise edition of Teleport for this option.
</Notice>

Teleport implements OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, which is similar to SAML in principle.

Here is an example of this setting in the `teleport.yaml` :

```yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: oidc
```
