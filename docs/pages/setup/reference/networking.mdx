## Public address

All three Teleport services (proxy, auth, node) have an optional
`public_addr` property. The public address can take an IP or a DNS name. It can
also be a list of values:

```yaml
public_addr: ["proxy-one.example.com", "proxy-two.example.com"]
```

Specifying a public address for a Teleport service may be useful in the
following use cases:

- You have multiple identical services, like proxies, behind a load balancer.
- You want Teleport to issue an SSH certificate for the service with the additional
  principals, e.g.host names.

## HTTP CONNECT proxies

Some networks funnel all connections through a proxy server where they can be
audited and access control rules are applied. For these scenarios, Teleport supports HTTP CONNECT tunneling.

To use HTTP CONNECT tunneling, simply set either the `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables and when Teleport builds and establishes the reverse tunnel to the main cluster, it will funnel all traffic through the proxy. Specifically, if using the default configuration, Teleport will tunnel ports `3024` (SSH, reverse tunnel) and `3080` (HTTPS, establishing trust) through the proxy.

The value of `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` should be in the format
`scheme://host:port` where scheme is either `https` or `http` . If the value is
`host:port` , Teleport will prepend `http` .

It's important to note that for Teleport to use HTTP CONNECT
tunneling, the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables must be set
within Teleport's environment. You can also optionally set the `NO_PROXY`
environment variable to avoid use of the proxy when accessing specified
hosts/netmasks. When launching Teleport with `systemd`, this will probably involve
adding some lines to your `systemd` unit file:

```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8"
```

  `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are invalid values for the proxy host. If for some reason your proxy runs locally, you'll need to provide some other DNS name or a private IP address for it.

## Ports

Teleport services listen on several ports. This table shows the default port numbers.

| Port | Service | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 3022 | Node | SSH port. This is Teleport's equivalent of port `22` for SSH. `ssh_service.listen_addr` |
| 3023 | Proxy | SSH port clients connect to. A proxy will forward this connection to port `3022` on the destination node. `proxy_service.listen_addr` |
| 3024 | Proxy | SSH port used to create "reverse SSH tunnels" from behind-firewall environments into a trusted proxy server. Teleport instances configured in IOT mode hold open connections to this port. `proxy_service.tunnel_listen_addr` |
| 3025 | Auth | TLS/HTTPS/GRPC port used by the Auth Service to serve its API to other nodes in a cluster. `auth_service.listen_addr` |
| 3080 | Proxy | HTTPS connection to authenticate `tsh` users and web users into the cluster. The same connection is used to serve a Web UI. `proxy_service.web_listen_addr` |
| 3026 | Proxy | HTTPS Kubernetes proxy that clients connect to. `proxy_service.kube_listen_addr` |
| 3027 | Kubernetes | Kubernetes Service that the proxy server connects to. `kubernetes_service.listen_addr` |
| 3036 | Proxy | MySQL port clients connect to. `proxy_service.mysql_addr` |
