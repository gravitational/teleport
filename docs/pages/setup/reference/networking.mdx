## Public address

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

All Teleport services (e.g., the Proxy Service, Auth Service, and Nodes) have an
optional `public_addr` property that you can modify in each service's
configuration file. The public address can take an IP or a DNS name. It can also
be a list of values:

```yaml
public_addr: ["proxy-one.example.com", "proxy-two.example.com"]
```

Specifying a public address for a Teleport service may be useful in the
following use cases:

- You have multiple identical services, e.g., Proxy Service instances, behind a
  load balancer.
- You want Teleport to issue an SSH certificate for the service with additional
  principals, e.g., host names.

## HTTP CONNECT proxies

Some networks funnel all connections through a proxy server where they can be
audited and access control rules can be applied. For these scenarios, Teleport
supports HTTP CONNECT tunneling.

To use HTTP CONNECT tunneling, set the `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`
environment variables when running Teleport. You can also optionally set the
`NO_PROXY` environment variable to avoid use of the proxy when accessing
specified hosts/netmasks.

For example, when launching Teleport with `systemd`, you can add
the following lines to your `systemd` unit file, replacing `proxy.example.com` with
the address of your proxy.

```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080/"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8"
```

When Teleport builds and establishes the reverse tunnel to the main cluster, it will funnel all traffic through the proxy. Specifically, if using the default configuration, Teleport will tunnel ports `3024` (SSH, reverse tunnel) and `3080` (HTTPS, establishing trust) through the proxy.

The value of `HTTPS_PROXY` or `HTTP_PROXY` should be in the format
`scheme://host:port` where scheme is either `https` or `http` . If the value is
`host:port` , Teleport will prepend `http` .

  `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are invalid values for the proxy host. If for some reason your proxy runs locally, you'll need to provide some other DNS name or a private IP address for it.

## Ports

<Tabs>
<TabItem scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} label="Self-Hosted">

Teleport services listen on several ports. This table shows the default port
numbers for each service.

<Admonition

  To get a listing of the assigned ports for an instance of the Teleport Proxy
  Service, use the following command:

  ```code
  $ curl https://teleport.example.com:443/webapi/ping | jq 
  ```

  Note that if `auth_service.proxy_listener_mode` is set to `multiplex` in your
  Teleport configuration, that means only a single port is used for
  multiple services through the Proxy.

| Port | Service | Description |
| - | - | - |
| 3022 | Node | SSH port. This is Teleport's equivalent of port `#22` for SSH. |
| 3023 | Proxy | SSH port clients connect to. The Proxy Service will forward this connection to port `#3022` on the destination Node. |
| 3024 | Proxy | SSH port used to create "reverse SSH tunnels" from behind-firewall environments into a trusted proxy server. |
| 3025 | Auth | SSH port used by the Auth Service to serve its API to other Nodes in a cluster. |
| 3080 | Proxy | HTTPS connection to authenticate `tsh` users into the cluster. The same connection is used to serve a Web UI. |
| 3026 | Kubernetes | HTTPS Kubernetes proxy `proxy_service.kube_listen_addr` |
| 3027 | Kubernetes | Kubernetes Service `kubernetes_service.listen_addr` |
| 3028 | Desktop | Desktop Service `windows_desktop_service.listen_addr` |
| 3036 | MySQL | MySQL port `proxy_service.mysql_addr` |

<TabItem scope={["cloud"]} label="Teleport Cloud">

Teleport services listen on several ports. This table shows the default port
numbers for each service. The Teleport Proxy Service is the host available at your
Teleport Cloud tenant URL, e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh`.
