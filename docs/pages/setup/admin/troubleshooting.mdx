## Troubleshooting

To diagnose problems you can configure [`teleport`](../reference/cli.mdx#teleport) to
run with verbose logging enabled by passing it `-d` flag.

<Admonition

  title="NOTE"
>
  It is not recommended to run Teleport in production with verbose logging as it generates a substantial amount of data.
</Admonition>

Sometimes you may want to reset [`teleport`](../reference/cli.mdx#teleport) to a clean
state. This can be accomplished by erasing everything under `"data_dir"`
directory. Assuming the default location, `rm -rf /var/lib/teleport/*` will do.

Teleport also supports HTTP endpoints for monitoring purposes. They are disabled
by default, but you can enable them:

```code
$ sudo teleport start --diag-addr=127.0.0.1:3000
```

Now you can see the monitoring information by visiting several endpoints:

- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/metrics` is the list of internal metrics Teleport is tracking. It is compatible with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
  collectors. For a full list of metrics review our [metrics reference](../reference/metrics.mdx).
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/healthz` returns "OK" if the process is healthy or
  `503` otherwise.
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/readyz` is similar to `/healthz`, but it returns "OK"
  *only after* the node successfully joined the cluster, i.e.it draws the difference between "healthy" and "ready".
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000/debug/pprof/` is Golang's standard profiler. It's only
  available when `-d` flag is given in addition to `--diag-addr`

## Debug dump

You can get a goroutine dump of a running process by sending it `USR1` signal.

Locate a running teleport daemon PID:

```code
# Locate teleport process PID
$ pidof teleport
235119
```

Send a `USR1` signal to teleport process:

```code
$ kill -USR1 $(pidof teleport)
```

Teleport will print the debug information to `stderr`. Here what you will see in the logs:

```txt
INFO [PROC:1]    Got signal "user defined signal 1", logging diagnostic info to stderr. service/signals.go:99
