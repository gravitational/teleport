title: AWS Database Auto-Discovery
description: How to configure Teleport to discover AWS-hosted databases.
---

Database discovery involves two components.

The first, the Discovery Service, is responsible for watching your cloud
provider and checking if there are any new databases or if there have been any
modifications to previously discovered databases.

The second, the Database Service, monitors the databases created by the
Discovery Service and proxies communications between users and the database
servers hosted by the cloud provider.

In this guide, you will configure a Teleport Discovery Service instance to
discover AWS-hosted databases automatically.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An AWS account with permissions to create and attach IAM policies.
- One or more database servers hosted by AWS database services.
- A host to run the Teleport Discovery Service.

## Step 1/4. Generate a join token

The Discovery Service requires a valid join token to connect to the cluster.

Generate a join token by running the following command against your Teleport
Auth Service and save it in `/tmp/token` on the host that will run the
Discovery Service.

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery
```

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/alternative-methods-join.mdx!)

## Step 2/4. Configure the Discovery service

Enabling AWS database discovery requires that the `discovery_service.aws`
section includes at least one entry and that `discovery_service.aws.types`
includes one of database types listed in the sample YAML below. 

Create a `teleport.yaml` file similar to the following on the host that will
run the Discovery Service:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "<Var name="teleport.example.com:443"/>"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  discovery_group: "aws-prod"
  aws:
    # Database types. Valid options are:
    # 'rds' - discovers AWS RDS and Aurora databases.
    # 'rdsproxy' - discovers AWS RDS Proxy databases.
    # 'redshift' - discovers AWS Redshift databases.
    # 'redshift-serverless' - discovers AWS Redshift Serverless databases.
    # 'elasticache' - discovers AWS ElastiCache Redis databases.
    # 'memorydb' - discovers AWS MemoryDB Redis databases.
    # 'opensearch' - discovers AWS OpenSearch Redis databases.
  - types: ["rds"]
    regions: ["us-east-1"]
    tags:
      "env": "prod" # Match database resource tags where tag:env=prod

  - types: ["redshift", "redshift-serverless"]
    regions: ["us-west-1"]
    tags:
      "env": "prod"
    # Optional AWS role that the Discovery Service will assume to discover
    # AWS-hosted databases. The IAM identity assigned to the host must be able
    # to assume this role.
    assume_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/example-role-name"
    # Optional AWS external ID that the Database Service will use to assume
    # a role in an external AWS account.
    external_id: "example-external-id"
```

Adjust the keys under `discovery_service.aws` to match your AWS databases.

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/discovery-group.mdx!)

## Step 3/4. Bootstrap IAM permissions

Create an IAM role and attach it to the host that will run the Discovery
Service.

Teleport can bootstrap IAM permissions for the Discovery Service using the
`teleport discovery bootstrap` command. You can use this command in automatic
or manual mode:

- In automatic mode, Teleport attempts to create the appropriate IAM policies
  and attach them to the specified IAM roles. This requires IAM permissions to
  create and attach IAM policies.
- In manual mode, Teleport prints the required IAM policies. You can then create
  and attach them manually using the AWS management console.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Automatic">
  Either temporarily give IAM admin permissions to the host of the Discovery
  Service or copy the service YAML configuration file to your desktop where you
  have the IAM admin permissions.

  Use this command to bootstrap the permissions automatically with YAML
  configuration file of the Discovery Service:

  ```code
  $ teleport discovery bootstrap \
    --attach-to-role arn:aws:iam::<Var name="aws-account-id"/>:role/<Var name="iam-role-name"/> \
    --policy-name TeleportDatabaseDiscovery \
    -c <Var name="/etc/teleport.yaml"/>
  ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Manual">
  Use the following command to display the required IAM policies that you need
  to create in your AWS console:

  ```code
  $ teleport discovery bootstrap --manual \
    --attach-to-role arn:aws:iam::<Var name="aws-account-id"/>:role/<Var name="iam-role-name"/> \
    --policy-name TeleportDatabaseDiscovery \
    -c <Var name="/etc/teleport.yaml"/>
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Details title="Bootstrapping with assume_role_arn in config">
When `assume_role_arn` is configured for AWS matchers, `teleport discovery
bootstrap` command determines the permissions required for the bootstrap target
AWS IAM identity using the following logic:

- When the target does not match `assume_role_arn` in any AWS matcher in the
  configuration file, the target is assumed to be the Teleport Discovery
  Service's AWS IAM identity and permissions are bootstrapped for all the AWS
  matchers without `assume_role_arn`.
- When an `--attach-to-role` target matches an `assume_role_arn` setting for
  AWS matchers in the configuration file, permissions are bootstrapped only for
  those AWS matchers.

You will need to run the bootstrap command once with the Teleport Discovery
Service's IAM identity as the policy attachment target, and once for each AWS
IAM role that is used for `assume_role_arn`.
</Details>

## Step 4/4. Use the Discovery Service

### Start the Discovery Service

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Discovery Service"!)

After the Discovery Service starts, database servers matching the tags and
regions specified in the AWS section are added to the Teleport cluster
automatically.

### List registered databases

You can list them with the `tctl get db` command or check a specific database
with `tctl get db/<database-name>`.

The default name of the discovered database includes the AWS resource ID,
endpoint and matcher types, AWS region and account ID to ensure uniqueness, for
example `my-postgres-rds-aurora-us-east-1-123456789012`.

A discovered database with the default name also has a shorter display name
that consists only the AWS resource ID and the endpoint type, for example
`my-postgres`, `my-postgres-reader`. Either the full name or the display name
can be used for `tctl` and `tsh` commands.

You can override the default name by applying the `TeleportDatabaseName` AWS
tag to the AWS database resource.
