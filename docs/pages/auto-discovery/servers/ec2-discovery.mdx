title: Configure Teleport to Automatically Enroll EC2 instances 
description: How to configure Teleport to automatically enroll EC2 instances.
---

The Teleport Discovery Service can connect to Amazon EC2 and automatically
discover and enroll EC2 instances matching configured labels. It will then
execute an install script on these discovered instances using AWS Systems
Manager that will install Teleport, start it and join the cluster.

In this scenario, Teleport Discovery Service uses an IAM invite token with a
long time-to-live (TTL), so that new instances can be discovered and added to
the Teleport cluster for the lifetime of the token.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- AWS account with EC2 instances and permissions to create and attach IAM
policies.
- EC2 instances running Ubuntu/Debian/RHEL/Amazon Linux 2 and SSM agent version 3.1 or greater if making use of the
default Teleport install script. (For other Linux distributions, you can
install Teleport manually.)
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/7. Create an EC2 invite token

When discovering EC2 instances, Teleport makes use of IAM invite tokens for
authenticating joining Nodes.

Create a file called `token.yaml`:

```yaml
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: aws-discovery-iam-token
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required (e.g. Node, App, Kube, DB, WindowsDesktop)
  roles: [Node]

  # set the join method allowed for this token
  join_method: iam

  allow:
  # specify the AWS account which Nodes may join from
  - aws_account: "123456789"
```

Assign the `aws_account` field to your AWS account number.
Add the token to the Teleport cluster with:

```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 2/7. Define an IAM policy

The `teleport discovery bootstrap` command will automate the process of
defining and implementing IAM policies required to make auto-discovery work. It
requires only a single pre-defined policy, attached to the EC2 instance running
the command:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetPolicy",
                "iam:TagPolicy",
                "iam:ListPolicyVersions",
                "iam:CreatePolicyVersion",
                "iam:CreatePolicy",
                "ssm:CreateDocument",
                "iam:DeletePolicyVersion",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "iam:PutRolePermissionsBoundary"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

Create this policy and apply it to the Node (EC2 instance) that will run the Discovery Service.

## Step 3/7. Install Teleport on the Discovery Node

<Admonition type="tip">

If you plan on running the Discovery Service on the same Node already running
another Teleport service (Auth or Proxy, for example), you can skip this step.

</Admonition>

Install Teleport on the EC2 instance that will run the Discovery Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 4/7. Configure Teleport to discover EC2 instances

If you are running the Discovery Service on its own host, the service requires a
valid invite token to connect to the cluster. Generate one by running the
following command against your Teleport Auth Service:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery
```

Save the generated token in `/tmp/token` on the Node (EC2 instance) that will
run the Discovery Service.

In order to enable EC2 instance discovery the `discovery_service.aws` section
of `teleport.yaml` must include at least one entry:

```yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "<Var name="teleport.example.com" />:443"
auth_service:
  enabled: off
proxy_service:
  enabled: off
ssh_service:
  enabled: off
discovery_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  aws:
   - types: ["ec2"]
     regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1"]
     install:
        join_params:
          token_name: aws-discovery-iam-token
          method: iam
     tags:
       "env": "prod" # Match EC2 instances where tag:env=prod
```

- Edit the `teleport.auth_servers` key to match your Auth Service or Proxy Service's URI
  and port.
- Adjust the keys under `discovery_service.aws` to match your EC2 environment,
  specifically the regions and tags you want to associate with the Discovery
  Service.

## Step 5/7. Bootstrap the Discovery Service AWS configuration

On the same Node as above, run `teleport discovery bootstrap`. This command
will generate and display the additional IAM policies and AWS Systems Manager (SSM) documents
required to enable the Discovery Service:

```code
$ sudo teleport discovery bootstrap
Reading configuration at "/etc/teleport.yaml"...

AWS
1. Create IAM Policy "TeleportEC2Discovery":
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",
                "ssm:ListCommandInvocations",
                "ssm:SendCommand"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

2. Create IAM Policy "TeleportEC2DiscoveryBoundary":
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",
                "ssm:ListCommandInvocations",
                "ssm:SendCommand"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

3. Create SSM Document "TeleportDiscoveryInstaller":

schemaVersion: '2.2'
description: aws:runShellScript
parameters:
  token:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport invite token to use when joining the cluster."
  scriptName:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport installer script to use when joining the cluster."
mainSteps:
- action: aws:downloadContent
  name: downloadContent
  inputs:
    sourceType: "HTTP"
    destinationPath: "/tmp/installTeleport.sh"
    sourceInfo:
      url: "https://teleport.example.com:443/webapi/scripts/installer/{{ scriptName }}"
- action: aws:runShellScript
  name: runShellScript
  inputs:
    timeoutSeconds: '300'
    runCommand:
      - /bin/sh /tmp/installTeleport.sh "{{ token }}"

4. Attach IAM policies to "yourUser-discovery-role".

Confirm? [y/N]: y
```

Review the policies and confirm:

```code
Confirm? [y/N]: y
✅[AWS] Create IAM Policy "TeleportEC2Discovery"... done.
✅[AWS] Create IAM Policy "TeleportEC2DiscoveryBoundary"... done.
✅[AWS] Create IAM SSM Document "TeleportDiscoveryInstaller"... done.
✅[AWS] Attach IAM policies to "alex-discovery-role"... done.
```

All EC2 instances that are to be added to the Teleport cluster by the
Discovery Service must include the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` IAM policy
in order to receive commands from the Discovery Service.

This policy includes the following permissions:

```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:DescribeAssociation",
                "ssm:GetDeployablePatchSnapshotForInstance",
                "ssm:GetDocument",
                "ssm:DescribeDocument",
                "ssm:GetManifest",
                "ssm:GetParameter",
                "ssm:GetParameters",
                "ssm:ListAssociations",
                "ssm:ListInstanceAssociations",
                "ssm:PutInventory",
                "ssm:PutComplianceItems",
                "ssm:PutConfigurePackageResult",
                "ssm:UpdateAssociationStatus",
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceAssociationStatus",
                "ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel",
                "ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel",
                "ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel",
                "ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage",
                "ec2messages:DeleteMessage",
                "ec2messages:FailMessage",
                "ec2messages:GetEndpoint",
                "ec2messages:GetMessages",
                "ec2messages:SendReply"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 6/7. [Optional] Customize the default installer script

(!docs/pages/includes/server-access/custom-installer.mdx cloud="AWS" matcher="aws" matchTypes="[\"ec2\"]"!)

## Step 7/7. Start Teleport

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx service="the Discovery Service"!)

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Discovery Service"!)

Once you have started the Discovery Service, EC2 instances matching the tags you
specified earlier will begin to be added to the Teleport cluster automatically.

## Troubleshooting

If Installs are showing failed or instances are failing to appear check the
Command history in AWS System Manager -> Node Management -> Run Command.
Select the instance-id of the Target to review Errors.

### `cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field`

If you encounter an error similar to the following:

```text
invalid format in plugin properties map[destinationPath:/tmp/installTeleport.sh sourceInfo:map[url:[https://example.teleport.sh:443/webapi/scripts/installer/preprod-installer](https://example.teleport.sh/webapi/scripts/installer/preprod-installer)] sourceType:HTTP];
error json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field DownloadContentPlugin.sourceInfo of type string
```

It is likely that you're running an older SSM agent version. Upgrade to SSM agent version 3.1 or greater to resolve.

### `InvalidInstanceId: Instances [[i-123]] not in a valid state for account 456`

The following problems can cause this error:
- The Discovery Service doesn't have permission to access the managed node.
- AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) isn't running. Verify that SSM Agent is running.
- SSM Agent isn't registered with the SSM endpoint. Try reinstalling SSM Agent.
- The discovered instance does not have permission to receive SSM
  commands, verify the instance includes the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore IAM policy.

See SSM RunCommand error codes and troubleshooting information in AWS documentation for more details:
