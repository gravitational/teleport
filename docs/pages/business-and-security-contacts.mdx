The **Business & Security Contacts** feature allows administrators to
configure email addresses that will receive important operational,
billing, and security-related notifications from Teleport.

This helps ensure that the right teams in your organization stay
informed about critical updates, such as license renewals,
security advisories, and compliance-related changes.

When you create a Teleport Enterprise account, the email associated with
your administrator will automatically be set as a business and
security contact.

## Contact types

You can configure two types of contact emails:

- **Business Contact**: Intended for billing, account management, and administrative notices.
- **Security Contact**: Intended for vulnerability disclosures, security alerts, and compliance communication.

You may configure the same email address for both roles or provide
separate addresses based on your organizationâ€™s structure.
Each contact type supports up to **three** email addresses.

Once confirmed, the contact becomes active and will receive relevant communications.

If the same address is used for both categories, it only needs to be confirmed once.
