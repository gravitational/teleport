Teleport is fully compatible with OpenSSH and can be quickly set up to record and
audit all SSH activity. 

Using Teleport and OpenSSH has the advantage of getting you up
and running, but in the long run, we would recommend replacing `sshd` with `teleport`.
We've outlined these reasons in [OpenSSH vs Teleport SSH for Servers?](https://gravitational.com/blog/openssh-vs-teleport/)

Teleport is a standards-compliant SSH proxy and can work in environments with
existing SSH implementations, such as OpenSSH. This guide will cover:

- Configuring the OpenSSH server `sshd` to join a Teleport cluster. Existing fleets of
  OpenSSH servers can be configured to accept SSH certificates dynamically issued by a Teleport CA.
- Configuring the OpenSSH client `ssh` to log in to Nodes inside a Teleport
  cluster.

  OpenSSH 6.9 is the minimum OpenSSH version compatible with Teleport. View your OpenSSH version with the command: 
  
  ```code
  $ ssh -V
  ```

## Configure an OpenSSH server to join a Teleport cluster

`sshd` must be told to allow users to log in with certificates generated
by the Teleport User CA. Start by exporting the Teleport CA public key.

Export the Teleport certificate authority certificate into a file and update
your SSH configuration to trust Teleport's CA:

```code
# tctl needs to be run on the Auth Server.
$ sudo tctl auth export --type=user | sed s/cert-authority\ // > teleport_user_ca.pub
$ sudo mv ./teleport_user_ca.pub /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub
$ echo "TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Restart `sshd`.

Now, `sshd` will trust users who present a Teleport-issued certificate.
The next step is to configure host authentication.

The recommended solution is to ask Teleport to issue valid host certificates for
all OpenSSH nodes. To generate a host certificate, run the following `tctl` command:

```code
# Creating host certs, with an array of every host to be accessed.
# Wildcard certs aren't supported by OpenSSH. The domain must be fully 
# qualified.
# Management of the host certificates can become complex. This is another
# reason we recommend using Teleport SSH on nodes.
$ sudo tctl auth sign \
      --host=api.example.com,ssh.example.com,64.225.88.175,64.225.88.178 \
      --format=openssh \
      --out=api.example.com

The credentials have been written to api.example.com, api.example.com-cert.pub

# You can use ssh-keygen to verify the contents.
$ ssh-keygen -L -f api.example.com-cert.pub
#api.example.com-cert.pub:
#        Type: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com host certificate
#        Public key: RSA-CERT SHA256:ireEc5HWFjhYPUhmztaFud7EgsopO8l+GpxNMd3wMSk
#        Signing CA: RSA SHA256:/6HSHsoU5u+r85M26Ut+M9gl+HventwSwrbTvP/cmvo
#        Key ID: ""
#        Serial: 0
#        Valid: after 2020-07-29T20:26:24
#        Principals:
#               api.example.com
#               ssh.example.com
#               64.225.88.175
#               64.225.88.178
#        Critical Options: (none)
#        Extensions:
#                x-teleport-authority UNKNOWN OPTION (len 47)
#                x-teleport-role UNKNOWN OPTION (len 8)
```

Then add the following lines to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on all OpenSSH nodes, and
restart `sshd`.

```yaml
HostKey /etc/ssh/api.example.com
HostCertificate /etc/ssh/api.example.com-cert.pub
```

## Use the OpenSSH client to access Teleport Nodes

It is possible to use the OpenSSH client `ssh` to connect to Nodes within a
Teleport cluster. Teleport supports SSH subsystems and includes a `proxy` subsystem that can be used like `netcat` is with `ProxyCommand` to connect
through a jump host.

OpenSSH client configuration may be generated automatically by `tsh`, or it can
be configured manually. In either case, make sure you are running OpenSSH's
`ssh-agent`, and have logged in to the Teleport Proxy Service:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>

```code
$ eval `ssh-agent`
$ tsh --proxy=root.example.com login
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ eval `ssh-agent`
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh login
```

</ScopedBlock>

`ssh-agent` will print environment variables into the console. Either `eval` the
output as in the example above, or copy and paste the output into the shell you
will be using to connect to a Teleport Node. The output exports the
`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment variables that allow OpenSSH
clients to find the SSH agent.

### Automatic setup

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  Automatic OpenSSH client configuration is supported on Linux and macOS as of
  Teleport 7.0 and on Windows as of Teleport 7.2.
</Admonition>

`tsh` can automatically generate the necessary OpenSSH client configuration to
connect using the standard OpenSSH client:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>

```code
# On the machine where you want to run the SSH client
$ tsh --proxy=root.example.com config
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
# On the machine where you want to run the SSH client
$ tsh --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh config
```

</ScopedBlock>

This will generate an OpenSSH client configuration block for the root cluster
and all currently-known leaf clusters (if you are using Trusted Clusters).
Append this to your local OpenSSH config file (usually `~/.ssh/config`) using
your text editor of choice.

<ScopedBlock>

Once configured, log into any node in the `root.example.com` cluster:

```code
$ ssh user@node1.root.example.com
```

If any Tusted Clusters exist, they are also configured:

```code
$ ssh user@node2.leaf.example.com
```

When connecting to Nodes with Teleport daemons running on non-standard ports
(other than `3022`), a port may be specified:

```code
$ ssh -p 4022 user@node3.leaf.example.com
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

Once configured, log in to any Node in the `mytenant.teleport.sh` cluster:

```code
$ ssh user@node1.mytenant.teleport.sh
```


This will connect to the node `node1` on the `mytenant.teleport.sh` cluster. This
name does not need to be DNS accessible as the connection will be routed through
your Teleport Proxy Service.

If any Trusted Clusters exist, they are also configured:

```code
$ ssh user@node2.mytenant.teleport.sh
```

When connecting to Nodes with Teleport daemons running on non-standard ports
(other than `3022`), a port may be specified:

```code
$ ssh -p 4022 user@node3.mytenant.teleport.sh
```

</ScopedBlock>

<Admonition

  title="Automatic OpenSSH and Multiple Clusters"

  If you switch between multiple Teleport Proxy Servers, you'll need to re-run
  `tsh config` for each to generate the cluster-specific configuration.

  Similarly, if Trusted Clusters are added or removed, be sure to re-run the
  above command and replace the previous configuration.

</Admonition>

### Manual setup

On your client machine, you need to import the public key of Teleport's host
certificate. This will allow your OpenSSH client to verify that host certificates
are signed by Teleport's trusted host CA:

```code
$ tctl auth export --type=host > teleport_host_ca.pub

# On the machine where you want to run the ssh client
$ cat teleport_host_ca.pub >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

If you have multiple Teleport clusters, you have to export and set up these
certificate authorities for each cluster individually.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="OpenSSH and Trusted Clusters"
>
  If you use [Recording Proxy Mode](../../architecture/proxy.mdx) and [Trusted Clusters](../../setup/admin/trustedclusters.mdx),
  you need to set up the certificate authority from
  the root cluster to match all Nodes, even those that belong to leaf
  clusters. 
  
  For example, if your Node naming scheme is `*.root.example.com`,
  `*.leaf1.example.com`, `*.leaf2.example.com`, then the
  `@certificate-authority` entry should match `*.example.com` and use the CA
  from the root Auth Server only.
</Admonition>

</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

Lastly, configure the OpenSSH client to use the Teleport Proxy Service when connecting
to Nodes with matching names. Edit `~/.ssh/config` for your user or
`/etc/ssh/ssh_config` for global changes:

```txt
# root.example.com is the jump host (Proxy Service). Credentials will be
# obtained from the SSH agent.
Host root.example.com
    HostName 192.168.1.2
    Port 3023

# Connect to Nodes in the root.example.com cluster through the jump
# host (Proxy Service). Credentials will be obtained from the
# SSH agent.
Host *.root.example.com
    HostName %h
    Port 3022
    ProxyCommand ssh -p 3023 %r@root.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p

# Connect to Nodes within a Trusted Cluster with the name "leaf1.example.com".
Host *.leaf1.example.com
   HostName %h
   Port 3022
   ProxyCommand ssh -p 3023 %r@root.example.com -s proxy:%h:%p@leaf1.example.com
```

When everything is configured properly, you can use SSH to connect to any Node
behind `root.example.com`:

```code
$ ssh root@database.root.example.com
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

Lastly, configure the OpenSSH client to use the Teleport Proxy Service when connecting
to Nodes with matching names. Edit `~/.ssh/config` for your user or
`/etc/ssh/ssh_config` for global changes:

```txt
# mytenant.teleport.sh is the jump host (Proxy Service). Credentials will be
# obtained from the SSH agent.
Host mytenant.teleport.sh
    HostName 192.168.1.2
    Port 3023

# Connect to Nodes in the mytenant.teleport.sh cluster through the jump
# host (Proxy Service). Credentials will be obtained from the
# SSH agent.
Host *.mytenant.teleport.sh
    HostName %h
    Port 3022
    ProxyCommand tsh proxy ssh %r@%h:%p

# Connect to Nodes within a Trusted Cluster with the name "leaf1.mytenant.teleport.sh".
Host *.mytenant.teleport.sh
   HostName %h
   Port 3022
   ProxyCommand tsh proxy ssh --cluster=mytenant.teleport.sh %r@%h:%p
```

When everything is configured properly, you can use SSH to connect to any Node
behind `mytenant.teleport.sh`:

```code
$ ssh root@database.root.mytenant.teleport.sh
```

</ScopedBlock>

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Note"
>
  Teleport uses OpenSSH certificates instead of keys, which means you cannot ordinarily connect to a Teleport Node by IP address. You have to connect by
  DNS name. This is because OpenSSH ensures the DNS name of the Node you are connecting to is listed under the `Principals` section of the OpenSSH certificate to verify you are connecting to the correct Node.
</Admonition>

To connect to the OpenSSH server via `tsh`, add `--port=<ssh port>` with the `tsh ssh` command:

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss","enterprise"]}>

Example `tsh ssh` command to access `database.work.example.com` as `root` with
an OpenSSH server on port 22 via `tsh`:

```code
$ tsh ssh --port=22 dev@database.root.example.com
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

Example `tsh ssh` command to access `database.work.mytenant.teleport.sh` as `root` with
an OpenSSH server on port 22 via `tsh`:

```code
$ tsh ssh --port=22 dev@database.root.mytenant.teleport.sh
```

</ScopedBlock>

<Admonition
  type="warning"
  title="Warning"
>
  The principal/username (`dev@` in the example above) being used to connect must be listed in the Teleport user/role configuration.
</Admonition>

## Revoke an SSH certificate

To revoke the current Teleport CA and generate a new one, run `tctl auth rotate`. Unless you've highly automated your
infrastructure, we would suggest you proceed with caution as this will invalidate the user
and host CAs, meaning that the new CAs will need to be exported to every OpenSSH-based machine again using `tctl auth export` as above.
