This guide explains how to use Teleport and JetBrains IDE to access files with SFTP.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- JetBrains IDE like PyCharm, IntelliJ, Goland etc. [Products](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/#type=ide)
- One or more Teleport Nodes with Server Access enabled. If you have not yet
done this, read the [Server Access Getting Started Guide](../getting-started.mdx) to learn how.

## Step 1/3. First-time setup

Configure your local SSH client to access Teleport Nodes, assigning the `--proxy` flag to the address of your Teleport Proxy Service (e.g., `mytenant.teleport.sh` for Teleport Cloud users).

```code
# log in to your proxy:
$ tsh login --proxy proxy.foo.example.com --user alice

# generate the OpenSSH config for the proxy:
$ tsh config --proxy proxy.foo.example.com
```

Append the resulting configuration snippet into your SSH config file located
in the path below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Linux/MacOS">
    `$HOME/.ssh/config`
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    `%UserProfile%\.ssh\config`

    <Admonition type="warning">
      If using PowerShell on Windows to write your SSH config, note that normal
      shell redirection may write the file with the incorrect encoding. To
      ensure it's written properly, try the following:

      ```code
      $ tsh.exe config | out-file .ssh\config -encoding utf8 -append
      ```
    </Admonition>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should be able to connect to the desired node using following command, replacing `user` with the username you would like to assume on the node.

```code
$ ssh user@[node name].[cluster name]
```

<Details scopeOnly={true} scope={["cloud"]} title="Teleport Cloud">
  The SSH config you generated earlier instructs your SSH client to run `tsh proxy ssh` to access a Node in your Teleport cluster.
  However, running an `ssh` command against the Teleport Proxy Service at `yourtenant.teleport.sh` will result in an error.
</Details>

<Admonition type="note">
  Teleport's certificates expire fairly quickly, after which SSH
  attempts will fail with an error like the following:

  ```txt
  alice@proxy.foo.example.com: Permission denied (publickey).
  ERROR: exit status 255

  kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
  ```

  When you see this error, re-run `tsh login` to refresh your local certificate.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/3. Configure JetBrains IDE

After opening your IDE go to `Tools` -> `Deployment` -> `Browse Remote Host`.

![Deployment](../../../img/jetbrains-sftp/deployment-main.png)

Then click plus sign in the left top corner to add a new server.

![Add server](../../../img/jetbrains-sftp/add-server.png)

Enter a name for your new server.

![New Deployment](../../../img/jetbrains-sftp/deployment-added.png)

Click three dots next to `SSH configuration` as in the picture above.

![SSH Configuration](../../../img/jetbrains-sftp/ssh-configurations.png)

Create a new configuration by clicking plus sign on the left top and providing:

* `Host` - name of the Teleport node.
* `Port` - is the SSH node port (3022 by default).
* `Username` - is the system username.

As an `Authentication type` pick `OpenSSH config and authentication agent`.
Next, you can click `Test Connection`.

## Step 3/3. Browse remote host

After closing the SSH configuration window, you should see `Remote Host` menu in your IDE.

## Next Steps

### Using OpenSSH clients

This guide makes use of `tsh config`, added in Teleport 7.0; refer to the
[dedicated guide](./openssh.mdx) for additional information.
