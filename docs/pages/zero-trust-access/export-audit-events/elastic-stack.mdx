Teleport's Event Handler plugin receives audit events from the Teleport Auth
Service and forwards them to your log management solution, letting you perform
historical analysis, detect unusual behavior, and form a better understanding of
how users interact with your Teleport cluster.

In this guide, we will show you how to configure Teleport's Event Handler plugin
to send your Teleport audit events to the Elastic Stack. 

## How it works

The Teleport Event Handler authenticates to the Teleport Auth Service to receive
audit events over a gRPC stream, then sends those events to Logstash,
which stores them in Elasticsearch for visualization and alerting in Kibana.

## Prerequisites

- Logstash version 8.4.1 or above running on a Linux host. In this guide, you
  will also run the Event Handler plugin on this host.

- Elasticsearch and Kibana version 8.4.1 or above, either running via an Elastic
  Cloud account or on your own infrastructure. You will need permissions to
  create and manage users in Elasticsearch.

  We have tested this guide on the Elastic Stack version 8.4.1.

- A server, virtual machine, Kubernetes cluster, or Docker environment to run the
  Teleport Event Handler plugin.

This guide requires you to have completed one of the Event Handler setup guides:

- [Set up the Event Handler with tctl](event-handler-setup.mdx)
- [Set up the Event Handler with the Teleport Kubernetes Operator](event-handler-setup-operator.mdx)

The instructions below demonstrate a local test of the Event Handler plugin on
your workstation. You will need to adjust paths, ports, and domains for other
environments.

## Step 1/3. Configure a Logstash pipeline

The Event Handler plugin forwards audit logs from Teleport by sending HTTP
requests to a user-configured endpoint. We will define a Logstash pipeline that
handles these requests, extracts logs, and sends them to Elasticsearch.

### Create a role for the Event Handler plugin

Your Logstash pipeline will require permissions to create and manage
Elasticsearch indexes and index lifecycle management policies, plus get
information about your Elasticsearch deployment. Create a role with these
permissions so you can later assign it to the Elasticsearch user you will
create for the Event Handler.

In Kibana, navigate to "Management" > "Roles" and click "Create role". Enter the
name `teleport-plugin` for the new role. Under the "Elasticsearch" section,
under "Cluster privileges", enter `manage_index_templates`, `manage_ilm`, and
`monitor`.

Under "Index privileges", define an entry with `audit-events-*` in the "Indices"
field and `write` and `manage` in the "Privileges" field. Click "Create role".

### Create an Elasticsearch user for the Event Handler

Create an Elasticsearch user that Logstash can authenticate as when making
requests to the Elasticsearch API. 

In Kibana, find the hamburger menu on the upper left and click "Management",
then "Users" > "Create user". Enter `teleport` for the "Username" and provide a
secure password.

Assign the user the `teleport-plugin` role we defined earlier.

### Prepare TLS credentials for Logstash

Later in this guide, your Logstash pipeline will use an HTTP input to receive
audit events from the Teleport Event Handler plugin.

Logstash's HTTP input can only sign certificates with a private key that uses
the unencrypted PKCS #8 format. When you ran `teleport-event-handler configure`
earlier, the command generated an encrypted RSA key. We will convert this key to
PKCS #8.

You will need a password to decrypt the RSA key. To retrieve this, execute the
following command in the directory where you ran `teleport-event-handler
configure`:

```code
$ cat fluent.conf | grep passphrase
private_key_passphrase "ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff"
```

Convert the encrypted RSA key to an unencrypted PKCS #8 key. The command will
prompt your for the password you retrieved: 

```code
$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in server.key -nocrypt -out pkcs8.key
```

Enable Logstash to read the new key, plus the CA and certificate we generated
earlier:

```code
$ chmod +r pkcs8.key ca.crt server.crt
```

### Define an index template

When the Event Handler plugin sends audit events to Logstash, Logstash needs to
know how to parse these events to forward them to Elasticsearch. You can define
this logic using an index template, which Elasticsearch uses to construct an
index for data it receives.

Create a file called `audit-events.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "index_patterns": ["audit-events-*"],
  "template": {
    "settings": {},
    "mappings": {
      "dynamic":"true"
    }
  }
}
```

This index template modifies any index with the pattern `audit-events-*`.
Because it includes the `"dynamic": "true"` setting, it instructs Elasticsearch
to define index fields dynamically based on the events it receives. This is
useful for Teleport audit events, which use a variety of fields depending on
the event type.

### Define a Logstash pipeline

On the host where you are running Logstash, create a configuration file that
defines a Logstash pipeline. This pipeline will receive logs from port `9601`
and forward them to Elasticsearch.

On the host running Logstash, create a file called
`/etc/logstash/conf.d/teleport-audit.conf` with the following content:
 
```ruby
input {
  http {
    port => 9601
    ssl =>  true
    ssl_certificate => "/home/server.crt"
    ssl_key =>  "/home/pkcs8.key"
    ssl_certificate_authorities => [
      "/home/ca.crt"
    ]
    ssl_verify_mode => "force_peer"
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch {
    user => "teleport"
    password => "ELASTICSEARCH_PASSPHRASE"
    template_name => "audit-events"
    template => "/home/audit-events.json"
    index => "audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    template_overwrite => true
  }
}
```

In the `input.http` section, update `ssl_certificate` and
`ssl_certificate_authorities` to include the locations of the server certificate
and certificate authority files that the `teleport-event-handler configure`
command generated earlier. 

Logstash will authenticate client certificates against the CA file and present a
signed certificate to the Teleport Event Handler plugin.

Edit the `ssl_key` field to include the path to the `pkcs8.key` file we
generated earlier.

In the `output.elasticsearch` section, edit the following fields depending on
whether you are using Elastic Cloud or your own Elastic Stack deployment:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Elastic Cloud">

Assign `cloud_auth` to a string with the content `teleport:PASSWORD`, replacing
`PASSWORD` with the password you assigned to your `teleport` user earlier.	

Visit `https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments`, find the "Cloud ID" field, copy
the content, and add it as the value of `cloud_id` in your Logstash pipeline
configuration. The `elasticsearch` section should resemble the following:

```ruby
  elasticsearch {
    cloud_id => "CLOUD_ID"
    cloud_auth => "teleport:PASSWORD" 
    template_name => "audit-events"
    template => "/home/audit-events.json"
    index => "audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    template_overwrite => true
  }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Self-Hosted">

Assign `hosts` to a string indicating the hostname of your Elasticsearch host. 

Assign `user` to `teleport` and `password` to the passphrase you created for
your `teleport` user earlier.

The `elasticsearch` section should resemble the following:

```ruby
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => "elasticsearch.example.com"
    user => "teleport" 
    password => "PASSWORD" 
    template_name => "audit-events"
    template => "/home/audit-events.json"
    index => "audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
    template_overwrite => true
  }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Finally, modify `template` to point to the path to the `audit-events.json` file
you created earlier. 

Because the index template we will create with this file applies to indices
with the prefix `audit-events-*`, and we have configured our Logstash pipeline
to create an index with the title `"audit-events-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}`, Elasticsearch
will automatically index fields from Teleport audit events.

### Disable the Elastic Common Schema for your pipeline

The Elastic Common Schema (ECS) is a standard set of fields that Elastic Stack
uses to parse and visualize data. Since we are configuring Elasticsearch to
index all fields from your Teleport audit logs dynamically, we will disable the
ECS for your Logstash pipeline.

On the host where you are running Logstash, edit `/etc/logstash/pipelines.yml`
to add the following entry:

```yaml
- pipeline.id: teleport-audit-logs
  path.config: "/etc/logstash/conf.d/teleport-audit.conf"
  pipeline.ecs_compatibility: disabled
```

This disables the ECS for your Teleport audit log pipeline.

<Admonition type="tip">

If your `pipelines.yml` file defines an existing pipeline that includes
`teleport-audit.conf`, e.g., by using a wildcard value in `path.config`, adjust
the existing pipeline definition so it no longer applies to
`teleport-audit.conf`.

</Admonition>

### Run the Logstash pipeline

Restart Logstash:

```code
$ sudo systemctl restart logstash
```

Make sure your Logstash pipeline started successfully by running the following
command to tail Logstash's logs:

```code
$ sudo journalctl -u logstash -f
```

When your Logstash pipeline initializes its `http` input and starts running, you
should see a log similar to this:

```text
Sep 15 18:27:13 myhost logstash[289107]: [2022-09-15T18:27:13,491][INFO ][logstash.inputs.http][main][33bdff0416b6a2b643e6f4ab3381a90c62b3aa05017770f4eb9416d797681024] Starting http input listener {:address=>"0.0.0.0:9601", :ssl=>"true"}
```

These logs indicate that your Logstash pipeline has connected to Elasticsearch
and installed a new index template:

```text
Sep 12 19:49:06 myhost logstash[33762]: [2022-09-12T19:49:06,309][INFO ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch][main] Elasticsearch version determined (8.4.1) {:es_version=>8}
Sep 12 19:50:00 myhost logstash[33762]: [2022-09-12T19:50:00,993][INFO ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch][main] Installing Elasticsearch template {:name=>"audit-events"}
```
<details>
<summary>Pipeline not starting?</summary>

If Logstash fails to initialize the pipeline, it may continue to attempt to
contact Elasticsearch. In that case, you will see repeated logs like the one below:

```text
Sep 12 19:43:04 myhost logstash[33762]: [2022-09-12T19:43:04,519][WARN ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch][main] Attempted to resurrect connection to dead ES instance, but got an error {:url=>"http://teleport:xxxxxx@127.0.0.1:9200/", :exception=>LogStash::Outputs::ElasticSearch::HttpClient::Pool::HostUnreachableError, :message=>"Elasticsearch Unreachable: [http://127.0.0.1:9200/][Manticore::ClientProtocolException] 127.0.0.1:9200 failed to respond"}
```

### Diagnosing the problem

To diagnose the cause of errors initializing your Logstash pipeline, search your
Logstash `journalctl` logs for the following, which indicate that the pipeline is
starting. The relevant error logs should come shortly after these:

```text
Sep 12 18:15:52 myhost logstash[27906]: [2022-09-12T18:15:52,146][INFO][logstash.javapipeline][main] Starting pipeline {:pipeline_id=>"main","pipeline.workers"=>2, "pipeline.batch.size"=>125, "pipeline.batch.delay"=>50,"pipeline.max_inflight"=>250,"pipeline.sources"=>["/etc/logstash/conf.d/teleport-audit.conf"],:thread=>"#<Thread:0x1c1a3ee5 run>"}
Sep 12 18:15:52 myhost logstash[27906]: [2022-09-12T18:15:52,912][INFO][logstash.javapipeline][main] Pipeline Java execution initialization time {"seconds"=>0.76}
```

### Disabling Elasticsearch TLS

This guide assumes that you have already configured Elasticsearch and Logstash
to communicate with one another via TLS. 

If your Elastic Stack deployment is in a sandboxed or low-security environment
(e.g., a demo environment), and your `journalctl` logs for Logstash show that
Elasticsearch is unreachable, you can disable TLS for communication between
Logstash and Elasticsearch.

Edit the file `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` to set
`xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` to `false`, then restart Elasticsearch.

</details>

## Step 2/3. Run the Event Handler plugin

In this section, you will modify the Event Handler configuration you generated
and run the Event Handler to test your configuration.

### Configure the Event Handler

Edit the configuration for the Event Handler, depending on your installation method.

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/finish-event-handler-config.mdx!)

Update the following fields.

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/finish-event-handler-fields.mdx!)

Change `forward.fluentd.url` to the scheme, host and port you configured for
your Logstash `http` input earlier, `https://localhost:9601`. Change
`forward.fluentd.session-url` to the same value with the root URL path:
`https://localhost:9601/`.

### Start the Event Handler

(!docs/pages/includes/plugins/start-event-handler.mdx!)

## Step 3/3. Create a data view in Kibana

Make it possible to explore your Teleport audit events in Kibana by creating a
data view. In the Elastic Stack UI, find the hamburger menu on the upper
left of the screen, then click "Management" > "Data Views". Click "Create data
view".

For the "Name" field, use "Teleport Audit Events". In "Index pattern", use
`audit-events-*` to select all indices created by our Logstash pipeline. In
"Timestamp field", choose `time`, which Teleport adds to its audit events.

![Creating a data view](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/elasticsearch/data-view-create.png)

To use your data view, find the search box at the top of the Elastic Stack UI
and enter "Discover". On the upper left of the screen, click the dropdown menu
and select "Teleport Audit Events". You can now search and filter your Teleport
audit events in order to get a better understanding how users are interacting
with your Teleport cluster.

![Creating a data view](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/elasticsearch/data-view-explore.png)

For example, we can click the `event` field on the left sidebar and visualize
the event types for your Teleport audit events over time:

![Creating a visualization](../../../img/enterprise/plugins/elasticsearch/lens.png)

## Troubleshooting connection issues

If the Teleport Event Handler is displaying error logs while connecting to your
Teleport Cluster, ensure that:

- The certificate the Teleport Event Handler is using to connect to your
  Teleport cluster is not past its expiration date. This is the value of the
  `--ttl` flag in the `tctl auth sign` command, which is 12 hours by default.
- In your Teleport Event Handler configuration file, you have provided
  the correct host *and* port for the Teleport Proxy Service.

## Next steps

- Now that you are exporting your audit events to the Elastic Stack, consult our
[audit event reference](../../reference/deployment/monitoring/audit.mdx) so you can plan
visualizations and alerts.
- To see all of the options you can set in the values file for the
`teleport-plugin-event-handler` Helm chart, consult our [reference
guide](../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-plugin-event-handler.mdx).
