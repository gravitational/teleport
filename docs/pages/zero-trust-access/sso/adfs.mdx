This guide will explain how to configure Active Directory Federation Services
([ADFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services)) to be
a single sign-on (SSO) provider to issue login credentials to specific groups
of users. When used in combination with role based access control (RBAC), it
allows Teleport administrators to define policies like:

- Only members of "DBA" group can SSH into machines running PostgreSQL.
- Developers must never SSH into production servers.

## How it works

(!docs/pages/includes/sso/how-it-works.mdx idp="ADFS"!)

## Prerequisites

- ADFS installation with Admin access and users assigned to at least two groups.
- Teleport role with access to maintaining `saml` resources.  This is available in the default `editor` role.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx edition="Teleport Enterprise"!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/3. Configure ADFS

You'll need to configure ADFS to export claims about a user (Claims Provider
Trust in ADFS terminology) and you'll need to configure ADFS to trust
Teleport (a Relying Party Trust in ADFS terminology).

For Claims Provider Trust configuration, open the **AD FS** management window.
Under **Claims Provider Trusts**, right-click on **Active Directory** and
select **Edit Claim Rules**. You'll need to specify at least the following two
incoming claims: `Name ID` and `Group`.

- `Name ID` should be a mapping of the LDAP Attribute `E-Mail-Addresses` to
  `Name ID`.

- A group membership claim should be used to map users to roles (for example to
  separate normal users and admins).

  ![Group Configuration](../../../img/adfs-2.png)

- If you are using dynamic roles (see below), it may be useful to map the LDAP
  Attribute `SAM-Account-Name` to `Windows account name`:

  ![WAN Configuration](../../../img/adfs-3.png)

- And create another mapping of `E-Mail-Addresses` to `UPN`:

  ![UPN Configuration](../../../img/adfs-4.png)

You'll also need to create a Relying Party Trust. Use the below information to
help guide you through the Wizard.

- Create a Relaying Party Trust:
  ![Add a Claims Provider Trust](../../../img/adfs-add-provider-trust.png)
- Enter data about the relying party manually.
- Set the display name to something along the lines of `Teleport`.
- Skip the token encryption certificate.
- Select *"Enable support for SAML 2.0 Web SSO protocol"* and set the URL to
  `https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />/v1/webapi/saml/acs`, replacing the domain name
  with your Teleport Proxy Service URL. If you have a self-hosted cluster with
  multiple public addresses for the Teleport Proxy Service (the value of
  `proxy_service.public_addr` in the Teleport configuration file), ensure that this
  address points to the first one listed.
- Set the relying party trust identifier to
  `https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />/v1/webapi/saml/acs` as well.
- For access control policy select *"Permit everyone"*.

Once the Relying Party Trust has been created, update the Claim Issuance Policy
for it. Like before, make sure you send at least `Name ID` and `Group` claims to the
relying party (Teleport). If you are using dynamic roles, it may be useful to
map the LDAP Attribute `SAM-Account-Name` to *"Windows account name"* and create
another mapping of `E-Mail-Addresses` to *"UPN"*.

Lastly, ensure the user you create in Active Directory has an email address
associated with it. To check this open Server Manager then
*"Tools -> Active Directory Users and Computers"* and select the user and right
click and open properties. Make sure the email address field is filled out.

## Step 2/3. Connect ADFS to Teleport

In this section, you will create an authentication connector that provides
Teleport with the information it needs to exchange SAML messages with ADFS and
issue certificates to users.

### Assign a role mapping

(!docs/pages/includes/sso/role-mapping.mdx fieldType="attribute"!)

Make sure that, in your role mapping, each attribute begins with the following
namespace prefix:

```
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/
```

### Configure a SAML connector

Create a SAML connector resource using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl sso configure saml --acs https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />/v1/webapi/saml/acs \
  --preset adfs \
  --entity-descriptor https://adfs.example.com/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml \
  --attributes-to-roles <Var name="mapping_1" /> \
  --attributes-to-roles <Var name="mapping_2" />  \
  > adfs.yaml
```

The `--attributes-to-roles` flag contains the role mapping you assigned earlier.

The `acs` field should match the value you set in ADFS earlier and you can
obtain the `entity_descriptor_url` from ADFS under *"ADFS -> Service -> Endpoints -> Metadata"*.

### Export the signing key

For the last step, you'll need to export the signing key:

```code
$ tctl saml export adfs > saml.cer
```

Copy `saml.cer`, to ADFS server, open the "Relying Party Trust" and add this
file as one of the signature verification certificates:

![adfs-add-teleport-cert.png](../../../img/adfs-add-teleport-cert.png)

The Web UI will now contain a new button: "Login with MS Active Directory". The CLI is
the same as before:

```code
$ tsh --proxy=proxy.example.com login
```

This command will print the SSO login URL and try to open it
automatically in a browser.

<Admonition
  type="tip"
  title="Tip"
>
  Teleport can use multiple SAML connectors. In this case a connector name
  can be passed via `tsh login --auth=connector_name`
</Admonition>

### Test the connector

Run the following command to test your connector:

```code
$ tctl sso test < adfs.yaml
```

### Create the connector

Apply the connector:

```code
$ tctl create -f adfs.yaml
```
