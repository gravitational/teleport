title: Integrate your Identity Provider with Teleport
sidebar_label: Integrate your Provider
description: Provides step-by-step guides for allowing users to authenticate to Teleport using your IdP.
---

You can configure Teleport so that users authenticate with an external identity
provider such as Okta or GitHub. To do so, you can create a Teleport resource
called an **authentication connector** that contains information about your IdP
and configures the Teleport roles that users assume once they authenticate.

The guides in this section show you how to integrate your IdP with Teleport. 

For an overview of how Teleport integrates with single sign-on providers, see
[Single Sign-On](../sso.mdx).

Teleport Community Edition only supports GitHub as an identity provider. In
Teleport Enterprise, you can integrate SAML and OIDC solutions as well. All
editions support [local
users](../../../zero-trust-access/rbac-get-started/users.mdx).

## Integrating your provider

Integrating a provider with Teleport includes the following steps:

1. **Configure your IdP** to register Teleport as an application, resulting in a
   client ID, client secret, and other data about your application.
1. **Determine a role mapping:** When a user authenticates to Teleport, Teleport
   issues certificates containing the user's roles. A role mapping configures
   how Teleport selects roles for the user based on the user's GitHub teams,
   SAML attributes, or OIDC claims.
1. **Apply an authentication connector:** The authentication connector includes
   information about the role mapping and Teleport application, giving Teleport
   the information it needs to exchange SAML, OIDC, and GitHub SSO messages with
   your IdP and issue certificates to users. 
1. **Apply a cluster authentication preference:** The cluster auth preference
   resource selects an SSO provider as the default authentication method for
   Teleport users.

Teleport supports the following identity providers:

## Provider-specific workarounds

Certain SSO providers may require or benefit from changes to Teleport's SSO
flow. These provider-specific changes can be enabled by setting the
`spec.provider` property of the connector definition to one of the following
values to match your identity provider:

- `adfs` (SAML): Required for compatibility with Active Directory (ADFS); refer
  to the full [ADFS guide](adfs.mdx) for details.
- `jumpcloud` (SAML): Required for compatibility with JumpCloud.
- `netiq` (OIDC): Used to enable NetIQ-specific ACR value processing; refer to
  the [OIDC guide](oidc.mdx) for details.
- `ping` (SAML and OIDC): Required for compatibility with Ping Identity (including
  PingOne and PingFederate).
- `okta` (OIDC): Required when using Okta as an OIDC provider.

At this time, the `spec.provider` field should not be set for any other identity providers.

## Customizing authentication buttons 

Use the `display` field in an authentication connector to control the appearance
of SSO buttons in the Teleport Web UI.
