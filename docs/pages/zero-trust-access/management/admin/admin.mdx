The guides in this section show you the fundamentals of setting up and running a
Teleport cluster. You will learn how to run the `teleport` daemon, manage users
and resources, and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

If you already understand how to set up a Teleport cluster, consult the
[Operations](../operations/operations.mdx) section so you can start conducting periodic
cluster maintenance tasks.

## Run Teleport

- [Teleport Daemon](daemon.mdx): Set up Teleport as a daemon on Linux with systemd.
- [Run Teleport with Self-Signed Certificates](self-signed-certs.mdx): Set up Teleport in a local
environment without configuring TLS certificates.

## Manage users and resources

- [Trusted Clusters](trustedclusters.mdx): Connect multiple Teleport clusters using trusted clusters.
- [Labels](labels.mdx): Manage resource metadata with labels.
- [Local Users](users.mdx): Manage local user accounts.

## Troubleshoot issues

- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.mdx): Collect metrics and diagnostic information from Teleport.
- [Uninstall Teleport](uninstall-teleport.mdx): Uninstall Teleport from your system.
