title: Configuring break-glass SSH Access for Disaster Recovery
description: Guide to set up break-glass emergency SSH access for critical systems if Teleport becomes unavailable.
---

This guide will walk you through the steps required to configure emergency "break-glass" access for critical agents and servers via OpenSSH
using Teleport-issued certificates, in the following scenarios:

1. The Teleport Agent on a server has crashed, gone offline, or become unusable.
2. The Teleport control plane is down and cannot be used to access systems, and out-of-band access is necessary to fix it.

## How it works

Teleport's `user` CA can issue short-lived, signed certificates that can be used to grant access to OpenSSH servers in emergency disaster recovery scenarios.

By configuring the OpenSSH server alongside a Teleport Agent to trust Teleport's `user` CA, users with valid Teleport-issued certificates
can authenticate to the server without requiring static SSH keys or passwords - even if Teleport itself is down.

Below, we'll detail the steps to accomplish the following objectives:

1. Configure an out-of-band OpenSSH server running on the Teleport Agent machine to trust Teleport's `user` CA
1. Create a `breakglass` system user on the remote host
1. Create a `breakglass` Role in Teleport
1. Create a Teleport Machine ID bot (`tbot`) to issue a `breakglass` SSH Key and Certificate using Teleport's CA on an ongoing basis
1. Access the remote server using a Teleport issued cert, even if Teleport is down or unresponsive

<Admonition type="warning">
You must protect any machine that holds breakglass credentials as configured in steps 4 and 5. Anyone able to access these certificates will
be able to use them to get access to any machine configured with an out-of-band OpenSSH server (as per insructions in step 1).

Any use of the `breakglass` user, for any reason, should be a cause for immediate investigation.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

- OpenSSH client version 7.4 or above on your local machine.
- A Linux host with OpenSSH server (`sshd`) version 7.4 or above.

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

## Step 1/5. Configure an out-of-band OpenSSH server running on the Teleport Agent machine to trust the Teleport user CA

**This step is completed on the Teleport Agent machine.**

For break-glass access, an OpenSSH server must be running, and configured to trust client certificates issued by the Teleport `user`
Certificate Authority (CA).

1. Export the public key of the Teleport `user` CA:

On the Teleport Agent machine, run the following command. Replace `teleport.example.com` with the address of your Teleport Proxy Service:

```bash
export KEY=$(curl 'https://<Var name="teleport.example.com" />/webapi/auth/export?type=user' | sed "s/cert-authority\ /g/")
echo "$KEY" | sudo tee /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub
```

2. Ensure the following line is added and/or uncommented in your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

```
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
```

3. Create a `teleport-breakglass.conf` file under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d`:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/teleport-breakglass.conf > /dev/null <<'EOF'
# Teleport breakglass config
Match User breakglass
    # Trust the Teleport user CA for connections as this user
    TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/teleport_user_ca.pub
    # Explicitly use sshd's default behaviour: the username being used to connect must match a principal on the certificate
    AuthorizedPrincipalsFile none
    # Don't allow SSH key authentication as this user
    AuthorizedKeysFile /dev/null
EOF
```

4. Check the syntax of the sshd config file (you should see no errors printed):

```bash
sudo sshd -t
```

5. Restart the sshd service:

```bash
# This unit may also be called ssh.service depending on your distribution
# Check with 'systemctl list-unit-files | grep ssh | grep service'
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Now, `sshd` will trust users who present a Teleport-issued SSH certificate.


## Step 2/5. Create a `breakglass` user on the Teleport Agent server

**This step is completed on the Teleport Agent machine.**

Log into the Teleport Agent server and run the following commands.

1. Create the `breakglass` user:

```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password breakglass
```

<Admonition type="note">
As a general security principle, it is highly recommended to limit `root` permissions through `sudo`. Because `breakglass` will need
ability to gain elevated access to the system to troubleshoot and recover access, however, any use of break-glass access should always be audited
via `sshd` access logs.
</Admonition>


## Step 3/5. Create `breakglass` Role in Teleport

**This step is completed on your local machine.**

1. Log into your Teleport cluster with a user that has permission to create roles:

```bash
tsh login --proxy=<Var name="teleport.example.com" />
```

2. Create a `breakglass` Teleport role:

Define the role in a file named `breakglass-role.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: breakglass-role
spec:
  allow:
    logins:
    - breakglass
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
  deny: {}
  options:
    cert_format: standard
    forward_agent: false
    max_session_ttl: 24h0m0s
    port_forwarding: true
    ssh_file_copy: true
version: v7
```

Create the role by applying with:

```bash
tctl create -f breakglass-role.yaml
```


## Step 4/5. Create a Teleport Machine ID bot to issue an SSH Key and Certificate for the `breakglass` user using Teleport's CA

**This step is completed on the machine where you will make use of the certificates for break-glass access.**

This step will configure and start a [Teleport Machine ID bot](../../../machine-workload-identity/deployment/deployment.mdx) as a background
daemon (managed by `systemd`), which will continually generate and refresh a short-lived key and certificate for break-glass access on the machine
where it runs.

The configuration below generates a certificate which is valid for 24 hours from the time of issuance, refreshed every 2 hours. This means that
depending on the exact time of usage, the certificate will be usable for break-glass access for between 22 and 24 hours. This validity period was
chosen as a sane default to strike a good balance between usability (shorter-lived certificates may be invalid by the time they are needed) and
security (longer-lived certificates are less secure, as the period where they could be used if compromised is longer).

1. Create a `breakglass` bot which will run in the background to continually refresh a certificate which is valid for break-glass usage:

Define the bot in a file named `breakglass-bot.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: bot
version: v1
metadata:
  # name is a unique identifier for the Bot in the cluster.
  name: breakglass-bot
spec:
  # roles is a list of roles to grant to the Bot
  roles: ['breakglass-role']
```

2. Create the bot using `tctl`:

```bash
tctl create -f breakglass-bot.yaml
```

3. Create a [bound keypair](../../../reference/machine-workload-identity/bound-keypair/concepts.mdx) to use as a join method for running instances of the bot:

Define the join method in a file named `breakglass-token.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # This name will be used in tbot's `onboarding.token` field.
  name: breakglass-bot-join-token
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  # bot_name must match the name of the bot created earlier.
  bot_name: breakglass-bot
  join_method: bound_keypair
  bound_keypair:
    recovery:
      mode: standard
      limit: 1
```

4. Create the token using `tctl`:

```bash
tctl create -f breakglass-token.yaml
```

5. Get the `registration_secret` for the bot using `tctl` - this is needed to create the bot's config file in the next step.

```bash
sudo tctl get token/breakglass-bot-join-token --format=json | jq -r '.[0].status.bound_keypair.registration_secret'
```

This assumes `jq` is installed. If not, run `tctl get token/breakglass-bot-join-token` and inspect the `.status.bound_keypair.registration_secret` field.

6. Write a config file for the bot.

Define the config in a file named `/etc/tbot-breakglass.yaml`:

```yaml
version: v2
# replace teleport.example.com with the FQDN of your Teleport proxy server
proxy_server: <Var name="teleport.example.com" />:443
certificate_ttl: "24h"
renewal_interval: "2h"
onboarding:
  join_method: bound_keypair
  token: breakglass-bot-join-token
  bound_keypair:
    # replace this with the value of `registration_secret` from the previous step
    registration_secret: REGISTRATION-SECRET-VALUE-FROM-PREVIOUS-STEP
storage:
  type: directory
  # change to a directory to use to store the bot's own identity for communicating with the Teleport cluster
  path: /var/lib/teleport/breakglass-bot
outputs:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # change to the output directory you'd like to use to store the bot's outputted OpenSSH private key and certificate
    path: /opt/teleport-breakglass-output
```

7. To configure the bot to run in the background, write out a systemd unit file for the bot:

```bash
sudo tbot install systemd \
  --write \
  --name tbot-teleport-breakglass \
  --config /etc/tbot-breakglass.yaml \
  --user teleport \
  --group teleport
```

The user and group you specify here must already exist on the server running the `tbot` service. If you do not already have a `teleport` user and group,
create one:

```bash
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin teleport
```

8. Reload the systemd configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

9. Configure the bot to start when the machine boots, and start it immediately:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now tbot-teleport-breakglass
```

10. Check that the bot has started successfully:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status tbot-teleport-breakglass
● tbot-teleport-breakglass.service - tbot-teleport-breakglass - Teleport Machine & Workload Identity Service
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/tbot-teleport-breakglass.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Thu 2025-11-27 10:32:24 AST; 7s ago
   Main PID: 2437534 (tbot)
      Tasks: 9 (limit: 9065)
     Memory: 22.8M (peak: 23.4M)
        CPU: 239ms
     CGroup: /system.slice/tbot-teleport-breakglass.service
             └─2437534 /usr/local/bin/tbot start -c /etc/tbot-breakglass.yaml
```

11. Check that the bot has correctly outputted a certificate:

```bash
$ ls -l /opt/teleport-breakglass-output/
total 60
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport 5513 Nov 27 10:32 identity
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport  241 Nov 27 10:32 key
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport 1274 Nov 27 10:32 key-cert.pub
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport  161 Nov 27 10:32 key.pub
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport  612 Nov 27 10:32 known_hosts
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport 1379 Nov 27 10:32 ssh_config
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport 1330 Nov 27 10:32 teleport-database-ca.crt
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport 2051 Nov 27 10:32 teleport-host-ca.crt
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport  794 Nov 27 10:32 teleport-user-ca.crt
-rw------- 1 teleport teleport 1375 Nov 27 10:32 tlscert
```

12. Check the validity of the certificate to see that it is valid for ~24 hours from now:

```bash
$ date
Thu Nov 27 10:39:41 AST 2025
$ sudo ssh-keygen -Lf /opt/teleport-breakglass-output/key-cert.pub | grep Valid
        Valid: from 2025-11-27T10:31:24 to 2025-11-28T10:32:24
```


## Step 5/5. Access the Teleport Agent machine using OpenSSH

**This step is completed on the machine where you will make use of the certificates for break-glass access.**

1. Create a local SSH config which uses the Teleport-issued break-glass certificate to connect:

Define the config in a file called `breakglass_ssh_config`:

```bash
Host *
    User breakglass
    UserKnownHostsFile /opt/teleport-breakglass-output/known_hosts
    IdentityFile /opt/teleport-breakglass-output/key
    CertificateFile /opt/teleport-breakglass-output/key-cert.pub
    StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

2. Now, use the break-glass SSH config to securely access the Teleport Agent using the `breakglass` user and Teleport-issued certificate:

```bash
sudo ssh -F ./breakglass_ssh_config sshd-server
```

<Admonition type="note">
We use `sudo ssh` here because the outputted certificates and files in the `/opt/teleport-breakglass-output` directory are only
readable by the `teleport` user and `root`, to improve security.
</Admonition>

If you do not have DNS resolution available for the hostname you need to connect to, you can use the IP address:

```bash
sudo ssh -F ./breakglass_ssh_config 10.11.12.134
```

Alternatively, you can provide the IP to use with the `HostName` option to `ssh`:

```bash
sudo ssh -F ./breakglass_ssh_config -o "HostName=10.11.12.134" sshd-server
```

<Admonition type="important">
If the connection from `tbot` to the Teleport control plane remains offline, the outputted certificate will only be valid for the following
22 hours, then it will expire and break-glass access will no longer be available. If you cannot restore access to your Teleport control plane
within this timeframe, you should use your break-glass access to set up alternative strategies for access while the certificate is still valid.
</Admonition>

---

The method described above ensures you can securely access your servers and Teleport Agents in emergency scenarios using Teleport CA signed certificates,
even if Teleport's agents or control plane are down. This process can be used for any Teleport Agent running on a server which supports OpenSSH.
