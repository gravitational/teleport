## Disabling Account Assignment role creation

By default, the AWS Identity Center integration will create a Teleport role for
every possible combination of AWS Account and Permission Set managed by your AWS
Identity Center instance. If your Identity Center controls a large number of AWS
Accounts and/or Permission Sets, this may end up creating so many roles that it
becomes an irritant, and even start to affect Teleport's performance.

To avoid creating these Account Assignment roles, you can create the AWS IC 
integration with this feature disabled by specifying `--roles-sync-mode NONE`
when creating the integration with `tctl`, for example:

```console
$ tctl plugins install awsic \
    --instance-arn ${IDENTITY_CENTER_INSTANCE_ARN} \
    --instance-region ${IDENTITY_CENTER_INSTANCE_REGION} \
    --use-system-credentials \
    --assume-role-arn ${AWS_IAM_ROLE_ARN} \
    --scim-url ${IDENTITY_CENTER_SCIM_BASE_URL} \
    --scim-token ${IDENTITY_CENTER_SCIM_BEARER_TOKEN} \
    --access-list-default-owner ${TELEPORT_ACCESS_LIST_DEFAULT_OWNER} \
    --roles-sync-mode NONE
```

### Roles Sync Modes

The Roles Sync Mode controls whether the IC integration will create Account
Assignment roles for each possible AWS Account Assignment. There are currently
two possible values: `ALL` (create roles for all possible Account Assignments)
and `NONE` (do not create roles for _any_ possible Account Assignment).

<Admonition type="warning">
The integration's Group Import process uses these Account Assignment roles to
provision access for the Access Lists it creates. In order to prevent the integration
from creating invalid Access Lists, setting the Roles Sync Mode to `NONE` also 
requires that integration's Group Import filter contain a single exclude-all clause.

Teleport enforces this restriction, preventing the accidental creation of an invalid
configuration.

### Switching Modes

After installation you can switch the Roles Sync Mode from `NONE` to `ALL` using
`tctl plugins edit`.

```console
$ tctl plugins edit awsic --roles-sync-mode ALL
```

<Admonition type="warning">
Moving from Roles Sync Mode `ALL` to `NONE` may cause Teleport to potentially
delete in-use roles, so that transition is not allowed.

Currently the only way to move back to `NONE` is deleting and re-installing the integration.
