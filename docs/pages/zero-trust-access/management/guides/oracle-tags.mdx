title: Oracle Cloud Tags as Teleport Agent Labels
description: How to set up Teleport Agent labels based on Oracle Cloud tags
h1: Sync Oracle Cloud tags and Teleport Agent labels
---

When running on an Oracle Cloud (OCI) Compute instance, Teleport will
automatically detect and import the instance's freeform and defined tags
as Teleport labels for SSH servers, applications, databases, and Kubernetes clusters.
Tags imported this way will have the `oracle/` prefix.

When the Teleport process starts, it fetches all tags from OCI instance
metadata and adds them as labels. The instance's image must support IMDSv2. 
The process will update the tags every hour, so newly created or deleted tags
will be reflected in the labels. No additional permissions are required on the
instance.

If the freeform tag `teleporthostname` is present, its value (must be lower case)
will override the node's hostname.

```code
$ tsh ls
Node Name            Address        Labels

```

<Admonition type="note">
  For services that manage multiple resources (such as the Database Service), each resource will receive the
  same tags from Oracle.
