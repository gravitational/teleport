Teleport's approach to using short-lived certificates for all infrastructure
access means that it can generate large numbers of certificates every day. For
this reason, Teleport does not support traditional certificate revocation.

There are two options available for revoking access: CA rotations and Teleport locks.

## CA rotations

To generate a new certificate authority and invalidate user certificates issued
by the current CA, run `tctl auth rotate --type=user`. This process will require
that the newly generated CA certificate is uploaded to your entire fleet of
OpenSSH servers. This can be a disruptive change, especially in environments
that lack automation, so proceed with caution.

See the [CA rotations guide](../operations/ca-rotation.mdx) for more details on
how to execute the procedure.

## Locks

Teleport locks allow you to permanently or temporarily revoke access to a number
of different "targets". Supported lock targets include: specific users, roles,
servers, desktops, or MFA devices. For Machine & Workload Identity bots, this
additionally includes the join token name (for delegated join methods) and the
bot instance UUID. After you create a lock, all existing sessions where the loc
applies are terminated and new sessions are rejected while the lock remains in
force.

For more information, read our
[Session and Identity Locking Guide](../../../identity-governance/locking.mdx).
