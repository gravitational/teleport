title: Secure Practices for Teleport Clusters
description: Highlights recommended practices and ways to harden security for your Teleport cluster.
---

To help ensure that Teleport can protect your infrastructure in a production environment, you should 
be aware of and follow recommended security practices and address potential security issues to reduce 
system vulnerabilities and to avoid security incidents. In most cases, there are tradeoffs between 
convenience and security that you should take into consideration.

The topics in this section are intended to help secure your Teleport cluster in a way that's acceptable and 
reasonable for your organization.

You should note that the security practices covered in this section aren't necessarily reflected in the 
examples used in the documentation. Examples in the documentation are primarily intended for demonstration 
purposes and for development environments.

- [Restrict Access for Privileged Accounts](restrict-privileges.mdx). Learn about potential 
   risks of allowing privileged access and how to mitigate them.
- [Reducing the Blast Radius of Attacks](reduce-blast-radius.mdx).
  Prevent attackers from accessing your infrastructure even if they manage to
  obtain passwords or certificates.
- [Revoking Access](revoking-access.mdx). Revoke access in the event
  of a compromise.
