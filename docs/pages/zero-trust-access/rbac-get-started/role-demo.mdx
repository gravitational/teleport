Teleport Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system for managing who can
access what within your infrastructure. Instead of assigning permissions
directly to users, you create roles that define sets of permissions, then assign
those roles to users.

This guide helps you understand RBAC in Teleport by walking you through the
process of applying labels to resources, setting up minimal roles, and accessing
resources available to a particular role.

## How it works

This guide illustrates how to register a server with Teleport using a Docker
container and the Teleport SSH Service in order to apply RBAC rules for
accessing the server. While the example uses a Teleport-protected server,
applying RBAC rules for accessing infrastructure resources works in similar ways
for any Teleport-protected resource.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- A Teleport user with permissions to create join tokens and other roles. We
  recommend using a demo cluster with the preset `editor` role. 
- Docker installed on your workstation. Docker is only required for the local
  demo environment used in this guide. You can find installation instructions
  for Docker on [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you
  want to register servers in Teleport without using Docker, see the getting
  started guide for [server
  access](../../enroll-resources/server-access/getting-started.mdx).

## Step 1/2. Enroll resources with labels

In this section, you will enroll two servers with your Teleport cluster. One
server will have the `env:local-dev` label and the other will have the
`env:local-prod`.  Later in this guide, you will create a role that will allow a
user to access a server with the `env:local-dev` label and deny access to the
`env:local-prod` label.

### Enroll a server with the `env:local-dev` label

1. Create a join token for the server to use to join the cluster:

   ```code
   $ tctl tokens add --type=node
   ```

1. Assign the token to <Var name="token" /> and the host and web port of your
   Teleport Proxy Service to <Var name="example.teleport.sh:443" />.

1. Copy the following Teleport configuration to a file called `local-dev.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   version: v3
   teleport:
     data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
     join_params:
       token_name: <Var name="token" />
       method: token
     proxy_server: <Var name="example.teleport.sh:443" />
   auth_service:
     enabled: "false"
   ssh_service:
     enabled: "true"
     labels:
       env: local-dev
   proxy_service:
     enabled: "false"
   ```

   This Teleport configuration enables the Teleport SSH Service, which enrolls a
   server in your Teleport cluster. The `ssh_service.labels` field adds a label
   to the server called `env:local`.

1. Assign the absolute path to the configuration file you created to 
   <Var name="dev-config-path"/>.

1. Start the Teleport SSH Service on a local Docker container with the
   configuration and join it to your cluster:

   ```code
   $ docker run -v <Var name="dev-config-path"/>:/etc/teleport/teleport.yaml (=teleport.latest_ent_debug_docker_image=)
   ```

1. Wait for a minute or so. Verify that you have logged in via [tsh login](../../connect-your-client/tsh.mdx#introduction) and check that the server has joined your cluster by
   listing enrolled servers by label. You should see the server you just enrolled:

   ```code
   $ tsh ls env=local-dev
   Node Name    Address    Labels
   ------------ ---------- -------------
   80f60427d316 ⟵ Tunnel   env=local-dev   
   ```

### Enroll a server with the `env:local-prod` label

1. Open a separate terminal.

1. Create a join token for the server to use to join the cluster:

   ```code
   $ tctl tokens add --type=node
   ```

1. Assign the token to <Var name="token" />.

1. Copy the following YAML document to a file called `local-prod.yaml`. This
   configuration starts the Teleport SSH Service with the label
   `env:local-prod`:

   ```yaml
   version: v3
   teleport:
     data_dir: /var/lib/teleport
     join_params:
       token_name: <Var name="token" />
       method: token
     proxy_server: <Var name="example.teleport.sh:443" />
   auth_service:
     enabled: "false"
   ssh_service:
     enabled: "true"
     labels:
       env: local-prod
   proxy_service:
     enabled: "false"
   ```

1. Assign the absolute path to the configuration file you created to 
   <Var name="prod-config-path" />.

1. Start the Teleport SSH Service on a local Docker container with the
   configuration and join it to your cluster:

   ```code
   $ docker run -v <Var name="prod-config-path" />:/etc/teleport/teleport.yaml (=teleport.latest_ent_debug_docker_image=)
   ```

1. Ensure that the server has joined the cluster:

   ```code
   $ tsh ls env=local-prod
   Node Name    Address    Labels
   ------------ ---------- --------------
   ba2290caf694 ⟵ Tunnel   env=local-prod
   ```

## Step 2/3. Create a Teleport role

Create a role that can access servers with the `env:local-dev` label but not the
`env:local-prod` label.

1. Create a file called `role.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   version: v7
   metadata:
     name: local-dev-only
   spec:
     allow:
       logins: [root]
       node_labels:
         env: local-dev
   ```

   The `allow` block indicates what the user is allowed to access. By default,
   nothing is allowed, so each role must include at least one `allow` field to
   provide permissions.  

   The `spec.allow.logins` field allows the user to assume the `root` login when
   connecting to a server. You can change this to a less permissive login, but
   we are using `root` because it is the only available login on the Docker
   containers we spun up.

   `spec.allow.node_labels` uses wildcard syntax, which matches one or more
   characters, to allow users to connect to any server with a label that begins
   `env:local-`, such as the `env:local-dev` and `env:local-prod` labels we
   assigned to our servers.

   However, since the `deny.node_labels` field specifies `env:local-prod`, a
   user with this role would only be able to access the server with the
   `env:local-dev` label.

1. Create the role:

   ```code
   $ tctl create role.yaml
   ```

## Step 3/3. Access your server

In this step, you will create a local Teleport user with the `local-dev-access`
role, then list available servers and connect the one with the label
`env:local-dev`.

1. Create a local user named `alice` with the `local-dev-access` role:

   ```code
   $ tctl users add alice --roles=local-dev-access
   ```

1. Follow the instructions in your terminal to sign in as `alice`.

1. In your terminal, log out of your cluster and log in again, assigning <Var
   name="example.teleport.sh" /> to the domain name of your Teleport Proxy
   Service:

   ```code
   $ tsh logout
   $ tsh login --user=alice --proxy=<Var name="example.teleport.sh" />
   ```

1. List all servers available for your user to access. You should only see one:

   ```code
   $ tsh ls
   Node Name    Address    Labels
   ------------ ---------- -------------
   ba2290caf694 ⟵ Tunnel   env=local-dev
   ```

   Since `alice` is denied access to servers with the `env:local-prod` label,
   only the server with the `env:local-dev` label is available to connect to.

1. Access the server using the value of the `Node Name` field as shown in `tsh
   ls`. Assign <Var name="ba2290caf694" /> to then ame of your server:

   ```code
   $ tsh ssh root@<Var name="ba2290caf694" />
   ```

## Next steps

In this guide, you created a Teleport role that allowed and denied access to SSH
servers based on the labels that the servers were enrolled with. Read about more
things you can do with Teleport roles.

### Configure RBAC for specific kinds of resources

You can label all Teleport-protected resources and use those labels to set RBAC
policies. In addition, each kind of Teleport resource also has more specific
attributes that you can use to control access. Read the guides below to refine
your RBAC for each kind of resource:
