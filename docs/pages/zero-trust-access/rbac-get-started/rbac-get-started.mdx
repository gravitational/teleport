title: Get Started with Role-Based Access Control
description: Provides an introduction to the Teleport role-based access control system.
---

Teleport's role-based access control (RBAC) enables you to set fine-grained
policies for who can perform certain actions against specific resources. For
example, you can allow analytics team members to SSH into a MongoDB read
replica, but not the main database.

Teleport **roles** are [dynamic
resources](../infrastructure-as-code/infrastructure-as-code.mdx) that allow or
deny access to infrastructure resources, as well as to Teleport API operations
like creating users or reviewing Access Requests.

## Role demo

You can follow the [Teleport Role Demo](role-demo.mdx) guide for a quick
illustration of how Teleport roles work. 

## Labels

All infrastructure resources that are enrolled in your Teleport cluster have
**labels**, which are key-value pairs such as `env: dev`. When a user attempts to
connect to a resource, the Teleport Agent that proxies the resource checks the
user's Teleport roles to ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions
and, if not, denies the connection.

Read more about labels in [Add Labels to Resources](labels.mdx).

## Role templates

Teleport roles include a templating syntax that allows you to specify a user's
permissions based on data about the user, e.g., data from your organization's
identity provider or stored on the Teleport Auth Service backend.

Read more about [Teleport Role Templates](role-templates.mdx).

## Role reference

After getting familiar with the concepts we introduce in this section, you can
read the [Access Controls Reference](../../reference/access-controls/roles.mdx)
for descriptions of all fields you can configure in a Teleport role.
