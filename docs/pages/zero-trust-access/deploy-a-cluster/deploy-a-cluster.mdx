These guides show you how to run a self-hosted Teleport Enterprise cluster in
production.

## Getting started

Self-hosted Teleport Enterprise subscriptions require a valid license. We
recommend [reaching out to us directly](https://goteleport.com/contact-us/) to
learn more about getting started with this deployment option and start planning
your approach. Self-hosted Teleport Enterprise deployments typically take place
in conversation with the team at Teleport.

While designing a deployment, you can consult one of our two architectural
overviews of a highly available, self-hosted Teleport cluster: 

- [Single region](high-availability.mdx)
- [Multiple regions](multi-region-blueprint.mdx)

## Dedicated account dashboard

Teleport Enterprise subscriptions include a dedicated account dashboard with their preferred
subdomain of [teleport.sh](https://teleport.sh). The dedicated account dashboard provides
subscription administrators access to the license file, support links and Teleport Enterprise binary downloads.
