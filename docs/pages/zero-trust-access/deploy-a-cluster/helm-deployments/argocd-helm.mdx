Teleport can provide secure, unified access to your Kubernetes clusters. This
guide will show you how to deploy Teleport Kubernetes agent on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm
and ArgoCD.

## How it works

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. This is used to orchestrate large deployments, and avoid the Kubernetes resources to drift from the desired deployment.

Teleport has [an official Helm chart (`teleport-kube-agent`)](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx) that deploys a Teleport Agent in a Kubernetes cluster. The agent can be configured to run several services, but by default it runs the `kubernetes_service` to provide access to the Kubernetes API via Teleport.

This guide leverages ArgoCD's native Helm support to deploy the Teleport Agent using the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Kubernetes cluster you wish to provide access to via Teleport.
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)
- An existing ArgoCD instance (version 2.10 or greater) that can deploy to the
  above Kubernetes cluster.
- The `tsh` client tool v(=teleport.version=)+ installed on your workstation.
  You can download this from our [installation page](../../../installation/installation.mdx).
  
## Step 1/3. Generate a join token

Teleport agents use a join token to obtain certificates and connect to Teleport. See [joining docs](../../../reference/deployment/join-methods.mdx) for more information.
The token is only used to join initially, the Teleport Kube agent will store its
certificates in Kubernetes and won't need a token to join again in the future.
In this section, we will create a token for the agent to join the Teleport cluster.
```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=kube,app --ttl=5m
```

You can specify the following token types:

(!docs/pages/includes/token-types.mdx!)

See the `teleport-kube-agent` [chart
reference](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx#roles) for the
roles and token types that the chart supports.

## Step 2/3. Configure and deploy the `teleport-kube-agent` Helm chart via ArgoCD

1. Create a namespace for Teleport and configure its Pod Security Admission,
   which enforces security standards on pods in the namespace:

   ```code
   $ kubectl create namespace teleport
   namespace/teleport created
   
   $ kubectl label namespace teleport 'pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=baseline'
   namespace/teleport labeled
   ```

2. Create a new ArgoCD application using the following as a template.

``` yaml
project: default
source:
  repoURL: 'https://charts.releases.teleport.dev'
  targetRevision: (=teleport.version=)
  helm:
    values: |-
      roles: kube,app
      authToken: $YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
      proxyAddr: $YOUR_PROXY_ADDRESS
      kubeClusterName: $YOUR_KUBE_CLUSTER_NAME

      highAvailability:
          replicaCount: 2
          podDisruptionBudget:
              enabled: true
              minAvailable: 1
  chart: teleport-kube-agent
destination:
  server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  namespace: teleport
# This section is used to allow the teleport-kube-agent-updater to update the agent
# without ArgoCD reverting the update.
ignoreDifferences:
  - group: apps
    kind: StatefulSet
    name: $YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME
    namespace: teleport
    jqPathExpressions:
      - '.spec.template.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "teleport").image'
```

3. Sync your changes to apply the configuration using the following command:
```bash
$ argocd app sync $YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME
```
4. To verify setup check the readiness of the pods in the teleport namespace.
```code
$ kubectl -n teleport get pods

NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
<your-agent-release>-0                         1/1     Running   0          14m
<your-agent-release>-1                         1/1     Running   0          14m
<your-agent-release>-updater-d9f97f5dd-v57g9   1/1     Running   0          16m
```
## Step 3/3. Manage access to your new resource

In this step, we'll create a Teleport role called `kube-access`
that allows users to send requests to any Teleport-protected Kubernetes
cluster as a member of the `viewers` group. The Teleport Kubernetes Service
will impersonate the `viewers` group when proxying requests from those users.

1. Create a file called `kube-access.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   metadata:
     name: kube-access
   version: v7
   spec:
     allow:
       kubernetes_labels:
         '*': '*'
       kubernetes_resources:
         - kind: '*'
           namespace: '*'
           name: '*'
           verbs: ['*']
       kubernetes_groups:
       - viewers
     deny: {}
   ```

1. Apply your changes:

   ```code
   $ tctl create -f kube-access.yaml
   ```

   (!docs/pages/includes/create-role-using-web.mdx!)

1. (!docs/pages/includes/add-role-to-user.mdx role="kube-access"!)

While you have authorized the `kube-access` role to access Kubernetes clusters
as a member of the `viewers` group, this group does not yet have permissions
within its Kubernetes cluster. To assign these permissions, create a Kubernetes
`RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBindings` that grants permission to the `viewers`
group.

1. Create a file called `viewers-bind.yaml` with the following contents:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ClusterRoleBinding
   metadata:
     name: viewers-crb
   subjects:
   - kind: Group
     # Bind the group "viewers" to the kubernetes_groups assigned in the "kube-access" role
     name: viewers
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   roleRef:
     kind: ClusterRole
     # "view" is a default ClusterRole that grants read-only access to resources
     # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles
     name: view
     apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
   ```

1. Apply the `ClusterRoleBinding` with `kubectl`:

   ```code
   $ kubectl apply -f viewers-bind.yaml
   ```

Now any Teleport user you grant the `kube-access` role to will be able to see the
Kubernetes cluster and view its content as a member of the `viewers` group.

- **Further configure the Helm chart values:** For more information on configuring the
  kube-agent Helm chart see the [kube-agent reference](../../../reference/helm-reference/teleport-kube-agent.mdx).
- **Set up RBAC for Kubernetes access:** For more in depth information on configuring
  access see the [Kubernetes RBAC docs](../../../enroll-resources/kubernetes-access/controls.mdx).
- **Learn more about working with ArgoCD:** To learn more about managing Helm charts
