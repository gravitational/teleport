Teleport is designed to meet SOC 2 requirements for the purposes of accessing infrastructure, change management, and system operations. This document outlines a high
level overview of how Teleport can be used to help your company to become SOC 2 compliant.

<Admonition type="warning">

  SOC 2 compliance features are only available for Teleport Enterprise and
  Teleport Enterprise Cloud.

## Achieving SOC 2 Compliance with Teleport
SOC 2 or Service Organization Controls were developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). They are based on five trust services criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

## What Key SOC 2 Controls does Teleport help achieve?
Teleport helps with 4 of the 9 control areas.

### CC6 Control Activities
Teleport helps with separation of duties using RBAC and restricts access to authorized users
- Provide role-based access controls (RBAC) using short-lived certificates and your existing identity management service.

### CC6 Physical and Logical Access controls
Teleport issues temporary security credentials according to the user's role.

### CC7 System Operations
Teleport helps audit and monitor access.

- Audit events and session recordings are securely stored in a vault to prevent tampering.
- Convert logins, executed commands, deployments and other events into structured audit logs.
- Monitor, share and join interactive sessions in real-time from the CLI or browser.

### CC8 Change Management
Teleport helps users elevate their permissions during incidents, RBAC helps limit the need for approvals. The Teleport Slack integration allows for managers to quickly approve temporary SSH Access Requests.

- Let engineers request elevated permissions on the fly without ever leaving the terminal
- Approve or deny permission requests with ChatOps workflow via Slack or other supported platforms.
- Extend and customize permission elevation workflow with a simple API and extendable plugin system.

## What Specific Criteria does Teleport Help Satisfy? 

Below is a table of principles and common points of focus listed by [AICPA's official "Trust Services Criteria" reference document](https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/downloadabledocuments/trust-services-criteria-2020.pdf) and how Teleport helps satisfy them.

Each principle has many "Points of Focus" which will apply differently to different products and organizations, talk to an auditor to understand exactly which points of focus apply to your organization.

| Principle Criteria | Point of Focus | Teleport Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CC6.1 - Restricts Logical Access | Logical access to information assets, including hardware, data (at-rest, during processing, or in transmission), software, administrative authorities, mobile devices, output, and offline system components is restricted through the use of access control software and rule sets. | Teleport Enterprise supports robust [Role-based Access Controls (RBAC)](../../admin-guides/access-controls/access-controls.mdx) to: <ul> <li> Control which SSH nodes a user can or cannot access. </li> <li> Control cluster level configuration (session recording, configuration, etc.) </li> <li> Control which UNIX logins a user is allowed to use when logging into a server. </li></ul> |
| CC6.1 - Identifies and Authenticates Users | Persons, infrastructure, and software are identified and authenticated prior to accessing information assets, whether locally or remotely. | Provide role-based access controls (RBAC) using short-lived certificates and your existing identity management service. Connecting locally or remotely is just as easy. |
| CC6.1 - Considers Network Segmentation | Network segmentation permits unrelated portions of the entity&#39;s information system to be isolated from each other. | [Teleport enables beyond corp network segmentation](../../admin-guides/management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) <br/><br/> [Connect to nodes behind Firewalls or create reverse tunnels to a proxy server](../../faq.mdx) |
| CC6.1 - Manages Points of Access | Points of access by outside entities and the types of data that flow through the points of access are identified, inventoried, and managed. The types of individuals and systems using each point of access are identified, documented, and managed. | [Label Nodes to inventory and create rules](../../admin-guides/management/admin/labels.mdx) <br/><br/> [Create Labels from AWS Tags](../../admin-guides/management/guides/ec2-tags.mdx) <br/><br/>Teleport maintains a live list of all nodes within a cluster. This node list can be queried by users (who see a subset they have access to) and administrators any time. |
| CC6.1 - Restricts Access to Information Assets | Combinations of data classification, separate data structures, port restrictions, access protocol restrictions, user identification, and digital certificates are used to establish access-control rules for information assets. | [Teleport uses Certificates to grant access and create access control rules](../../core-concepts.mdx) | 
| CC6.1 - Manages Identification and Authentication | Identification and authentication requirements are established, documented, and managed for individuals and systems accessing entity information, infrastructure, and software. | Teleport makes setting policies for SSH requirements easy since it works in the cloud and on premise with the same authentication security standards. | 
| CC6.1 - Manages Credentials for Infrastructure and Software | New internal and external infrastructure and software are registered, authorized, and documented prior to being granted access credentials and implemented on the network or access point. Credentials are removed and access is disabled when access is no longer required or the infrastructure and software are no longer in use. | [Invite nodes to your cluster with short lived tokens](../../enroll-resources/agents/join-token.mdx) | 
| CC6.1 - Uses Encryption to Protect Data | The entity uses encryption to supplement other measures used to protect data at rest, when such protections are deemed appropriate based on assessed risk. | Teleport Audit logs can use DynamoDB encryption at rest. | 
| CC6.1 - Protects Encryption Keys | Processes are in place to protect encryption keys during generation, storage, use, and destruction. | Teleport acts as a Certificate Authority to issue SSH and x509 user certificates that are signed by the CA and are (by default) short-lived.

| CC6.3 - Uses Role-Based Access Controls | Role-based access control is utilized to support segregation of incompatible functions. | [Role based access control (&quot;RBAC&quot;) allows Teleport administrators to grant granular access permissions to users.](../../admin-guides/access-controls/access-controls.mdx) |

| CC6.6 - Restricts Access | The types of activities that can occur through a communication channel (for example, FTP site, router port) are restricted. | Teleport makes it easy to restrict access to common ports like 21, 22 and instead have users [tunnel to the server](../../faq.mdx) using Teleport. [Teleport uses the following default ports.](../../reference/networking.mdx) | 
| CC6.6 - Protects Identification and Authentication Credentials | Identification and authentication credentials are protected during transmission outside system boundaries. | [Yes, Teleport protects credentials outside your network allowing for Zero Trust network architecture](https://goteleport.com/blog/applying-principles-of-zero-trust-to-ssh/) |
