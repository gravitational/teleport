This guide demonstrates how to use the Terraform provider for Teleport in jobs
running on [env zero].

This guide does not cover running the Terraform provider locally, in other CI/CD
environments, or in short-lived cloud VMs. In any of these cases, refer to a
dedicated guide:

- [Run the Terraform Provider on Terraform Cloud](./terraform-cloud.mdx)
- [Run the Terraform Provider in CI or cloud VMs](./ci-or-cloud.mdx)
- [Run the Terraform Provider locally](./local.mdx)

## How it works

When running the Teleport Terraform provider on env zero, you can use its
built-in Machine & Workload ID support to dynamically authenticate to your
Teleport cluster without any shared secrets.

To do so, Teleport can make use of env zero's support for
[General OIDC Integrations][oidc], which provides OIDC tokens to jobs run on
env zero's platform. The Teleport Terraform provider can then use these tokens
to prove its identity to your Teleport cluster.

While following this guide, you'll configure your Teleport cluster to accept
join requests from env zero deployments and configure the provider to
authenticate using the `env0` join method.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx edition="Teleport 18.4.0"!)

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

  To import existing Teleport resources as Terraform resources, you must have
  Terraform version `v1.5.0` or above.

- An account and project on [env zero]

- The Teleport Terraform provider, v18.4.0 or later

## Step 1/5: Enable OIDC in env zero

OIDC integrations must be enabled in your organization's credential settings. To
do so:
1. Navigate to your organization settings
2. Select the "Policies" tab
3. Under the "Third-Party Authentication" header, ensure "Enable OIDC during deployments" is checked
4. If necessary, select "Save"

For more information, refer to [env zero's documentation](https://docs.env0.com/docs/oidc-integrations#enabling-oidc-token-availability).

## Step 2/5. Collect information

To allow deployment workflows to authenticate to Teleport, you'll need to
configure - at a minimum - the IDs of your organization and project. These
values can be found in the env zero UI.

To determine your organization ID, navigate to your organization's settings,
select the "General" tab, and make a note of the value shown in the ID field. If
desired, store your organization ID here: <Var name="example-organization-id" />

Next, you'll also need to retrieve a project ID. Navigate to the settings for
the desired project and make a note of the ID shown. If desired, you can insert
it here: <Var name="example-project-id" />

## Step 3/5. Configure env zero joining in Teleport

To start, the Teleport Auth Service needs to be configured to accept join
requests from env zero runs. We'll do this by creating a bot named `terraform`
which the Teleport Terraform provider will use in a later step.

Write the following to `terraform_bot.yaml`:

```yaml
kind: bot
version: v1
metadata:
  name: terraform
spec:
  # The terraform-provider role is a built-in role granting access to every
  # resource supported by the terraform provider.
  roles: ["terraform-provider"]
```

Then, create the bot from the new YAML manifest:

```code
$ tctl create -f terraform_bot.yaml
bot 'terraform' has been created
```

Next, the new bot needs to be allowed to authenticate with env zero's [OIDC
credentials][oidc]. Create a file named `terraform_token.yaml` with this
content:
```yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: terraform
spec:
  roles: [Bot]
  join_method: env0
  bot_name: terraform
  env0:
    allow:
      - organization_id: <Var name="example-organization-id" />
        project_id: <Var name="example-project-id" />
```

Additional allow rules fields may be used to further restrict which jobs are
allowed to authenticate , refer to the [`env0` join method reference][reference]
for a full list of options.

Note that all specified fields must match those presented to Teleport by a
deployment job for it to be allowed to join. If you want to allow multiple
different projects to join, you can add additional entries to the `allow` field.
Additionally, note that each entry must provide at minimum `organization_id` and
a project identifier (`project_id` or `project_name`).

Once finished, create the token:

```code
$ tctl create -f terraform_token.yaml
token 'terraform' has been created
```

## Step 4/5. Configure the Terraform Provider

In your `provider.tf` or similar, configure the `teleport` provider:

```hcl
provider "teleport" {
  addr = "example.teleport.sh:443"
  join_method = "env0"
  join_token = "terraform"
}
```

These parameters must be set:
- `addr` should match the public hostname and port of your Teleport cluster
- `join_method` should be `env0`
- `join_token` should match the name of the `token` resource created in Step #2

Be sure to remove any preexisting `identity_file_path`; it is replaced by
`join_method` and `join_token`.

For a complete example, consider this minimal `provider.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    teleport = {
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
      version = "(=teleport.plugin.version=)"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  addr = "example.teleport.sh:443"
  join_method = "env0"
  join_token = "terraform"
}

resource "teleport_role" "test" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name        = "test"
    description = "Dummy role to validate Terraform Provider setup"
    labels = {
      test = "yes"
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5/5. Run Terraform

You should now be able to perform a Terraform `plan` or `apply`. All types of
triggers should work, including CLI, API, and Git, so long as the run is
coordinated by Terraform Cloud.

If your local `terraform` is authenticated to env zero and
[Remote Plan][remote-plan] is configured, you can run:
```code
$ terraform plan
```

Otherwise, you can trigger a job execution through whichever means you normally
use: manually, via a Git hook, etc.

Regardless of trigger, the workflow should successfully execute, depending on
your Terraform configuration. You can use `tctl` to verify the dummy role was
created:
```code
$ tctl get role/test
```

## Next steps

- Now that you know how to manage Teleport configuration resources with
  Terraform and env zero, read the [Terraform resource
  reference](../../../reference/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx) so
  you can flesh out your configuration.
- To find out more about env zero's OIDC implementation, which Machine &
  Workload ID uses to authenticate to your Teleport cluster, read
  [env zero's documentation][oidc].
