title: Run the Teleport Terraform Provider on a Server
description: How to manage dynamic resources using the Teleport Terraform provider from a dedicated deployment server with MachineID.
---

This guide demonstrates how to set up the Terraform provider for Teleport on a persistent Linux or macOS server.

This guide does not cover running the Terraform provider locally, or in temporary environments such as
CI/CD and short-lived cloud VMs. If you are in one of those cases, please follow the dedicated guides:

- [Run the Terraform Provider in CI or cloud VMs](./ci-or-cloud.mdx)
- [Run the Terraform Provider locally](./local.mdx)

This guide will setup MachineID on the server. MachineID is Teleport's feature
for providing identities to machines and services, rather than users.

## How it works

This setup relies on a MachineID daemon (`tbot`) to join the Teleport cluster, obtain and refresh credentials for the
Terraform provider. The daemon stores its identity on the disk and refresh the terraform credentials, typically every
30 minutes.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- [Terraform >= (=terraform.version=)+](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

  ```code
  $ terraform version
  # Terraform v(=terraform.version=)
  ```

- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

- A Linux host that you wish to run the Teleport Terraform provider onto.

- A Linux user on that host that you wish Terraform and `tbot` to run as.

## Step 1/4. Install `tbot` on your server

You must install `tbot` and make it join the Teleport cluster.
To do so, follow [the `tbot` deployment guide for Linux](../../../machine-workload-identity/machine-id/deployment/linux.mdx)
until step 3. 

## Step 2/4. Configure RBAC

At this point, `tbot` is installed and configured on the machine that will run Terraform.

(!docs/pages/includes/management/dynamic-resources/terraform-role.mdx!)

Use the `tctl bots update` command to add the role to the Bot. Replace `example`
with the name of the Bot you created in the deployment guide.

```code
$ tctl bots update example --add-roles terraform-provider
```

## Step 3/4. Configure `tbot` output

Now, `tbot` needs to be configured with an output that will produce the
credentials needed by the Terraform provider. As the Terraform provider will be
accessing the Teleport API, the correct output type to use is `identity`.

For this guide, the `directory` destination will be used. This will write these
credentials to a specified directory on disk. Ensure that this directory can
be written to by the Linux user that `tbot` runs as, and that it can be read by
the Linux user that Terraform will run as.

Modify your `tbot` configuration to add an `identity` output:

```yaml
outputs:
- type: identity
  destination:
    type: directory
    # For this guide, /opt/machine-id is used as the destination directory.
    # You may wish to customize this. Multiple outputs cannot share the same
    # destination.
    path: /opt/machine-id
```

If operating `tbot` as a background service, restart it. If running `tbot` in
one-shot mode (which creates credentials and ends the process, rather than running
a background process), it must be executed before you attempt to execute the
Terraform plan later.

You should now see an `identity` file under `/opt/machine-id`. This contains
the private key and signed certificates needed by the Terraform provider to
authenticate with the Teleport Auth Service.

## Step 4/4. Run Terraform

Start by creating a new Terraform working directory:

```code
$ mkdir ./my-terraform && cd ./my-terraform
$ terraform init
```

In order to configure the Teleport Terraform provider to use the credentials
output by Machine ID, we use the `identity_file_path` option.

In this directory, create `main.tf`:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    teleport = {
      version = "(=teleport.version=)"
      source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
    }
  }
}

provider "teleport" {
  # Replace with the address of your Teleport Proxy or Auth Service.
  addr               = "teleport.example.com:443"
  # Replace with the directory configured in the identity output in the
  # previous step.
  identity_file_path = "/opt/machine-id/identity"
}

# We must create a test role, if we don't declare resources, Terraform won't try to
# connect to Teleport and we won't be able to validate the setup.
resource "teleport_role" "terraform-test" {
  version = "v7"
  metadata = {
    name        = "terraform-test"
    description = "Example role created by Terraform"
  }

  spec = {
    # This role does nothing as it is an example role.
    allow = {}
  }
}
```

Replace `teleport.example.com:443` with the address of your Teleport Proxy
Service or Auth Service. If you modified the destination directory from
`/opt/machine-id`, then this should also be replaced.

Now, execute Terraform to test the configuration:

```code
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Check your Teleport cluster, ensuring the role has been created:

```code
$ tctl get role/terraform-test
```

## Next steps

- Explore the
  [Terraform provider resource reference](../../../reference/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx)
  to discover what can be configured with the Teleport Terraform provider.
- Read the [tbot configuration reference](../../../reference/machine-id/configuration.mdx) to explore
  all the available `tbot` configuration options.
