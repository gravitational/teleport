The Teleport Terraform provider allows Teleport administrators to use Terraform to configure Teleport via
dynamic resources.

## Get started

For an example of using the Teleport Terraform provider to deploy Teleport
Agents, configure Single Sign-On, and manage role-based access controls, see
[Getting Started](./terraform-getting-started.mdx).

## Authenticate the provider

The provider must obtain an identity to connect to Teleport. The method to
obtain it depends on where the Terraform code is executed. You must pick the
correct guide for your setup.

For quick local demos, you can [generate temporary credentials](local.mdx) for
the Terraform provider

If you are using a third-party cloud platform to manage infrastructure as code,
you can use the platform to authenticate the Teleport Terraform provider. The
Teleport Terraform provider integrates with the following solutions:

- [Spacelift](spacelift.mdx)
- [Terraform Cloud](terraform-cloud.mdx) 
- [env zero](env0.mdx)

It is also possible to set up the Teleport Terraform provider with a [CI
platform or cloud VM](ci-or-cloud.mdx) that has a built-in authentication
system, as well as a [dedicated server](dedicated-server.mdx) with long-running
workloads.

If none of the above options fit your use case, you may want to consider
[long-lived credentials](long-lived-credentials.mdx). We discourage this option
because it is the least secure.

## Manage resources

Once you have a functional Teleport Terraform provider, you will want to
configure your resources with it.

For instructions on managing specific Teleport dynamic resources with Terraform,
read [Managing Resources with Infrastructure as
Code](../managing-resources/managing-resources.mdx).

The list of supported resources and their fields is available [in the Terraform
reference](../../../reference/infrastructure-as-code/terraform-provider/terraform-provider.mdx).

Some resources have their dedicated Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) step-by step guides such as:
- [Managing Users And Roles With IaC](../managing-resources/user-and-role.mdx)
- [Creating Access Lists with IaC](../managing-resources/access-list.mdx)
- [Registering Agentless OpenSSH Servers with IaC](../managing-resources/agentless-ssh-servers.mdx)

Finally, you can [import your existing resources in Terraform](import-existing-resources.mdx).

## Upgrade the provider

Make sure the Teleport Terraform provider remains up to date so your
configuration is compatible with your Teleport backend.

1. Determine the version your Teleport cluster expects for client tools.
   Substitute <Var name="example.teleport.sh" /> with the domain name of your
   Teleport cluster. (This command assumes that you have the [jq
   CLI](https://jqlang.org/) installed on your system.)

   ```code
   $ curl https://<Var name="example.teleport.sh" />/webapi/ping | \
     jq -r '.auto_update.tools_version'
     (=teleport.version=)
   ```

1. Ensure your Teleport Terraform provider configuration specifies the correct
   version:

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       teleport = {
         source  = "terraform.releases.teleport.dev/gravitational/teleport"
         version = "(=teleport.version=)"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
