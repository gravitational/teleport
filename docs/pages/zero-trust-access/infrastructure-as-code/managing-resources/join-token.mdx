title: Managing Join Tokens with Infrastructure as Code
sidebar_label: Join Token
---

This guide shows you how to manage join tokens with infrastructure as code (IaC)
tools, including The Teleport `tctl` CLI, Terraform, and Kubernetes resources.

This guide is a conceptual overview of using IaC tools to managing join tokens.
Once you understand the overall flow, we recommend reading one of the guides to
[Teleport join methods](../../../enroll-resources/agents/agents.mdx) to pick the
join method that is best for your use case and implement it with an IaC
solution.

## How it works

Teleport processes use join tokens to establish trust with the Teleport Auth
Service. Once this is done, the Teleport Auth Service issues certificates to the
process. Join tokens include one or more **roles**, which in this context,
indicate the services the process is allowed to run, such as Teleport Agent
services, the Proxy Service, and the Auth Service.

Join tokens are dynamic resources stored on the Auth Service backend. On a
Teleport process joining the cluster, the Teleport configuration file includes a
reference to a token, allowing the Auth Service to authenticate the joining
process against the token.

Infrastructure as code tools can act as Auth Service API clients to manage join
tokens. If you are managing Teleport processes as part of the same Terraform
module or Helm chart, you must establish a dependency relationship between the
token and the Teleport process that uses it to join a cluster.
