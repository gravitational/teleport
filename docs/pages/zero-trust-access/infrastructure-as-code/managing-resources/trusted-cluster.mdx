title: Managing Trusted Clusters With IaC
description: Use infrastructure-as-code tooling to create Teleport trusted clusters.
---

<Admonition type="note">
Trusted clusters are only available for self-hosted Teleport clusters.
</Admonition>

This guide will explain how to deploy trusted clusters through infrastructure as
code.

## How it works

Teleport supports three ways to dynamically create resources from code:

- The Teleport Kubernetes Operator, which allows you to manage Teleport resources
  from Kubernetes
- The Teleport Terraform Provider, which allows you to manage Teleport resources
  via Terraform
- The `tctl` CLI, which allows you to manage Teleport resources from your local
  computer or your CI environment

## Prerequisites

- Access to **two** Teleport cluster instances. Follow the [Run a Self-Hosted Demo Cluster](../../../linux-demo.mdx)
  guide to learn how to deploy a self-hosted Teleport cluster on a Linux server.

  The two clusters should be at the same version or, at most, the leaf cluster can be one major version
  behind the root cluster version.

- A Teleport SSH server that is joined to the cluster you plan to use as the **leaf cluster**.
  For information about how to enroll a resource in your cluster, see
  [Join Services to your Cluster](../../../enroll-resources/agents/agents.mdx).

- Read through the [Configure Trusted Clusters](../../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx)
  guide to understand how trusted clusters works.

- The `tctl` admin tool and `tsh` client tool.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

- Read through the [Looking up values from secrets](../teleport-operator/secret-lookup.mdx) guide
  to understand how to store sensitive custom resource secrets in Kubernetes
  Secrets.

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

- Validate Kubernetes connectivity by running the following command:

  ```code
  $ kubectl cluster-info
  # Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443
  # CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
  ```

  <Admonition type="tip">
    Users wanting to experiment locally with the Operator can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
    to start a local Kubernetes cluster:

    ```code
    $ minikube start
    ```

  </Admonition>

- Follow the [Teleport operator guides](../teleport-operator/teleport-operator.mdx)
  to install the Teleport Kubernetes Operator in your Kubernetes cluster.

  Confirm that the CRD (Custom Resource Definition) for trusted clusters has
  been installed with the following command:

  ```code
  $ kubectl explain TeleportTrustedClusterV2.spec
  GROUP:      resources.teleport.dev
  KIND:       TeleportTrustedClusterV2
  VERSION:    v1

  FIELD: spec <Object>


  DESCRIPTION:
      TrustedCluster resource definition v2 from Teleport

  FIELDS:
    enabled	<boolean>
      Enabled is a bool that indicates if the TrustedCluster is enabled or
      disabled. Setting Enabled to false has a side effect of deleting the user
      and host certificate authority (CA).

    role_map	<[]Object>
      RoleMap specifies role mappings to remote roles.

    token	<string>
      Token is the authorization token provided by another cluster needed by this
      cluster to join.

    tunnel_addr	<string>
      ReverseTunnelAddress is the address of the SSH proxy server of the cluster
      to join. If not set, it is derived from `<metadata.name>:<default reverse
      tunnel port>`.

    web_proxy_addr	<string>
      ProxyAddress is the address of the web proxy server of the cluster to join.
      If not set, it is derived from `<metadata.name>:<default web proxy server
      port>`.

## Step 1/5. Prepare the leaf cluster environment

This guide demonstrates how to enable users of your root cluster to access
a server in your leaf cluster with a specific user identity and role.
For this example, the user identity you can use to access the server in the leaf
cluster is `visitor`. Therefore, to prepare your environment, you first need to
create the `visitor` user and a Teleport role that can assume this username when
logging in to the server in the leaf cluster.

To add a user and role for accessing the trusted cluster:

1. Open a terminal shell on the server running the Teleport Agent in the leaf cluster.

1. Add the local `visitor` user and create a home directory for the user by running the
following command:

   ```code
   $ sudo useradd --create-home visitor
   ```

   The home directory is required for the `visitor` user to access a shell on the server.

1. Sign out of all user logins and clusters by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tsh logout
   ```

1. Sign in to your **leaf cluster** from your administrative workstation using
your Teleport username:

   ```code
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="leafcluster.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   ```

   Replace `leafcluster.example.com` with the Teleport leaf cluster domain and
   `myuser` with your Teleport username.

1. Create a role definition file called `visitor.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   kind: role
   version: v7
   metadata:
     name: visitor
   spec:
     allow:
       logins:
         - visitor
       node_labels:
         '*': '*'
   ```

   You must explicitly allow access to nodes with labels to SSH into the server running
   the Teleport Agent. In this example, the `visitor` login is allowed access to any server.

1. Create the `visitor` role by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl create visitor.yaml
   ```

   You now have a `visitor` role on your leaf cluster. The `visitor` role allows
   users with the `visitor` login to access nodes in the leaf cluster. In the next step,
   you must add the `visitor` login to your user so you can satisfy the conditions of
   the role and access the server in the leaf cluster.


## Step 2/5. Prepare the root cluster environment

Before you can test access to the server in the leaf cluster, you must have a
Teleport user that can assume the `visitor` login. Because authentication is
handled by the root cluster, you need to add the `visitor` login to a user in the
root cluster.

To add the login to your Teleport user:

1. Sign out of all user logins and clusters by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tsh logout
   ```

1. Sign in to your **root cluster** from your administrative workstation using
your Teleport username:

   ```code
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="rootcluster.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   ```

   Replace `rootcluster.example.com` with the Teleport root cluster domain and
   `myuser` with your Teleport username.

1. Open your user resource in your editor by running a command similar to the
following:

   ```code
   $ tctl edit user/<Var name="myuser" />
   ```

   Replace `myuser` with your Teleport username.

1. Add the `visitor` login:

   ```diff
      traits:
        logins:
   +    - visitor
        - ubuntu
        - root
   ```

1. Apply your changes by saving and closing the file in your editor.

## Step 3/5. Generate a trusted cluster join token

Before users from the root cluster can access the server in the
leaf cluster using the `visitor` role, you must define a trust relationship
between the clusters. Teleport establishes trust between the root cluster and a
leaf cluster using a **join token**.

To set up trust between clusters, you must first create the join token using the
Teleport Auth Service in the root cluster. You can then use the Teleport Auth Service
on the leaf cluster to create a `trusted_cluster` resource that includes the join token,
proving to the root cluster that the leaf cluster is the one you expect to register.

To establish the trust relationship:

1. Sign out of all user logins and clusters by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tsh logout
   ```

1. Sign in to your **root cluster** from your administrative workstation using
your Teleport username:

   ```code
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="rootcluster.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   ```

   Replace `rootcluster.example.com` with the Teleport root cluster domain and
   `myuser` with your Teleport username.

1. Generate the join token by running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl tokens add --type=trusted_cluster --ttl=5m
   The cluster join token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
   ```

   This command generates a trusted cluster join token to allow an inbound
   connection from a leaf cluster. The token can be used multiple times. In this
   command example, the token has an expiration time of five minutes.

   Note that the join token is only used to establish a
   connection for the first time. Clusters exchange certificates and
   don't use tokens to re-establish their connection afterward.

   You can copy the token for later use. If you need to display the token again,
   run the following command against your root cluster:

   ```code
   $ tctl tokens ls
   Token                                                    Type            Labels   Expiry Time (UTC)
   -------------------------------------------------------- --------------- -------- ---------------------------
   (=presets.tokens.first=)                         trusted_cluster          28 Apr 22 19:19 UTC (4m48s)
   ```

<Admonition type="tip" title="For Kubernetes Operator users">
The trusted cluster join token is sensitive information and should not be stored
directly in the trusted cluster custom resource. Instead, store the token in a
Kubernetes secret. The trusted cluster resource can then be configured to
perform a secret lookup in the next step.

   ```yaml
   # secret.yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: teleport-trusted-cluster
     annotations:
       # This annotation allows any CR to look up this secret.
       # You may want to restrict which CRs are allowed to look up this secret.
       resources.teleport.dev/allow-lookup-from-cr: "*"
   # We use stringData instead of data for the sake of simplicity, both are OK
   stringData:
     token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
   ```

   ```code
   $ kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
   ```

## Step 4/5. Create a trusted cluster resource

You're now ready to configure and create the trusted cluster resource.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="tctl">

1. Configure your Teleport trusted cluster resource in a file called
`trusted-cluster.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   # trusted-cluster.yaml
   kind: trusted_cluster
   version: v2
   metadata:
     # The resource name must match the name of the trusted cluster.
     name: rootcluster.example.com
   spec:
     # enabled enables the trusted cluster relationship.
     enabled: true

     # token specifies the join token.
     token: (=presets.tokens.first=)

     # role_map maps Teleport roles from the root cluster in the leaf cluster.
     # In this case, users with the `access` role in the root cluster are granted
     # the `visitor` role in the leaf cluster.
     role_map:
       - remote: "access"
         local: ["visitor"]

     # tunnel_addr specifies the reverse tunnel address of the root cluster proxy.
     tunnel_addr: rootcluster.example.com:443

     # web_proxy_addr specifies the address of the root cluster proxy.
     web_proxy_addr: rootcluster.example.com:443
   ```

1. Sign in to your **leaf cluster** from your administrative workstation using
your Teleport username:

   ```code
   $ tsh login --proxy=<Var name="leafcluster.example.com" /> --user=<Var name="myuser" />
   ```

1. Create the trusted cluster resource from the resource configuration file by running
the following command:

   ```code
   $ tctl create trusted_cluster.yaml
   ```

   You can also configure leaf clusters directly in the Teleport Web UI.
   For example, you can select **Zero Trust Access** in the left pane, then click **Manage Clusters** to create a
   new `trusted_cluster` resource or manage an existing trusted cluster.

1. List the created `trusted_cluster` resource:

   ```code
   $ tctl get tc
   kind: trusted_cluster
   version: v2
   metadata:
     name: rootcluster.example.com
     revision: ba8205a9-c82c-458b-a0f6-76f7c4145672
   spec:
     enabled: true
     role_map:
     - local:
       - visitor
       remote: access
     token: (=presets.tokens.first=)
     tunnel_addr: rootcluster.example.com:443
     web_proxy_addr: rootcluster.example.com:443
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Kubernetes Operator">

1. Configure your Kubernetes trusted cluster resource in a file called
`trusted-cluster.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   # trusted-cluster.yaml
   apiVersion: resources.teleport.dev/v1
   kind: TeleportTrustedClusterV2
   metadata:
     # The resource name must match the name of the trusted cluster.
     name: rootcluster.example.com
   spec:
     # enabled enables the trusted cluster relationship.
     enabled: true

     # token specifies the join token.
     # This value will be resolved from the previously stored secret.
     # `teleport-trusted-cluster` is the secret name and `token` is the secret key.
     token: "secret://teleport-trusted-cluster/token"

     # role_map maps Teleport roles from the root cluster in the leaf cluster.
     # In this case, users with the `access` role in the root cluster are granted
     # the `visitor` role in the leaf cluster.
     role_map:
       - remote: access
         local:
           - visitor

     # tunnel_addr specifies the reverse tunnel address of the root cluster proxy.
     tunnel_addr: rootcluster.example.com:443

     # web_proxy_addr specifies the address of the root cluster proxy.
     web_proxy_addr: rootcluster.example.com:443
   ```

1. Create the Kubernetes resource:

   ```code
   $ kubectl apply -f trusted-cluster.yaml
   ```

1. List the created Kubernetes resource:

   ```code
   $ kubectl get trustedclustersv2
   NAMESPACE         NAME                     AGE
   default           rootcluster.example.com  60s
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Terraform">


1. Configure your Terraform trusted cluster resource in a file called
`trusted-cluster.tf`.

   ```hcl
   # trusted-cluster.tf
   resource "teleport_trusted_cluster" "cluster" {
     version: v2
     metadata = {
       # The resource name must match the name of the trusted cluster.
       name = "rootcluster.example.com"
     }

     spec = {
        # enabled enables the trusted cluster relationship.
       enabled = true

       # token specifies the join token.
       token = "(=presets.tokens.first=)"

       # role_map maps Teleport roles from the root cluster in the leaf cluster.
       # In this case, users with the `access` role in the root cluster are granted
       # the `visitor` role in the leaf cluster.
       role_map = [{
         remote = "access"
         local  = ["visitor"]
       }]

       # tunnel_addr specifies the reverse tunnel address of the root cluster proxy.
       tunnel_addr = "rootcluster.example.com:443"

       # web_proxy_addr specifies the address of the root cluster proxy.
       web_proxy_addr = "rootcluster.example.com:443"
     }
   }
   ```

1. Plan and apply the terraform resources

   ```code
   $ terraform plan
   [...]
   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

   $ terraform apply
   [...]
   teleport_trusted_cluster.cluster: Creating...
   teleport_trusted_cluster.cluster: Creation complete after 0s [id=rootcluster.example.com]
   Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

1. Sign out of the leaf cluster and sign back in to the root cluster.

1. Verify the trusted cluster configuration by running the following command in
the root cluster:

   ```code
   $ tsh clusters
   Cluster Name                Status Cluster Type Labels Selected
   --------------------------- ------ ------------ ------ --------
   rootcluster.example.com     online root                *
   leafcluster.example.com     online leaf
   ```

## Step 5/5. Access a server in the leaf cluster

With the `trusted_cluster` resource you created earlier, you can log in to the
server in your leaf cluster as a user of your root cluster.

To test access to the server:

1. Verify that you are signed in as a Teleport user on the root cluster by
running the following command:

   ```code
   $ tsh status
   ```

1. Confirm that the server running the Teleport Agent is joined to the leaf cluster by
running a command similar to the following:

   ```code
   $ tsh ls --cluster=<Var name="leafcluster.example.com" />
   Node Name       Address        Labels
   --------------- -------------- ------------------------------------
   ip-172-3-1-242  127.0.0.1:3022 hostname=ip-172-3-1-242
   ip-172-3-2-205  ⟵ Tunnel      hostname=ip-172-3-2-205
   ```

1. Open a secure shell connection using the `visitor` login:

   ```code
   $ tsh ssh --cluster=<Var name="leafcluster.example.com" /> visitor@ip-172-3-2-205
   ```

1. Confirm you are logged in with as the user `visitor` on the server
in the leaf cluster by running the following commands:

   ```code
   $ pwd
   /home/visitor
   $ uname -a
   Linux ip-172-3-2-205 5.15.0-1041-aws #46~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jul 19 15:39:29 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
   ```

<Admonition type="tip" title="For Kubernetes Operator users">
**Manage an existing trusted cluster with the Teleport Kubernetes Operator**

If you have an existing trusted cluster that you would like to manage with the
Teleport Kubernetes Operator, you can do this by first setting the trusted
cluster label `teleport.dev/origin: kubernetes`. The Teleport Kubernetes
Operator will then be able to adopt the `trusted_cluster` as a managed resource.

```yaml
kind: trusted_cluster
metadata:
  name: rootcluster.example.com
  labels:
    teleport.dev/origin: kubernetes
