## Semantic Versioning

Teleport follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for pre-releases and releases.

**Pre-releases**

Pre-releases have suffixes `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc`.
They are not ready for production:

* You can use alpha releases such as `5.0.1-alpha.1` for trying new features.
  Things can break and new changes may not be backwards-compatible.

* Teleport `beta` releases, such as `5.0.1-beta.2` are suitable for staging environments.
  We are unlikely to change the APIs while we are ironing out bugs and UX glitches.

* We mark release candidates as `5.0.1-rc.1` coding and bug fixes are finished.
  The team is going through the manual test plan to find any regressions.

**Releases**

Releases are ready for production use.

* Releases `5.0.0` and `6.0.0` are major releases. We publish 4 major releases each year.
Read more about upgrades and compatibility [here](../admin-guide.mdx#component-compatibility).

* Releases `5.1.0` are minor releases. They contain minor backwards-compatible improvements and backports.

* Versions like `5.0.1` are quick patches. They contain backwards-compatible fixes.
