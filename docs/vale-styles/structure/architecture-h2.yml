# This style enforces the presence of architectural information in how-to
# guides. The motivation is that the architecture of the setups shown in how-to
# guides is often a point of confusion for users.
#
# In this rule, the first H2 of a how-to guide must be called "How it works".
# This style defines a how-to guide as any guide that includes at least one H2
# beginning "Step [0-9]".
