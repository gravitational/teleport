# Because of a bug in pnpm, we need this "empty" pnpm-workspace.yaml file.
# Without it, running `pnpm install` from `docs/check-redirects` was simply
# installing dependencies for the root workspace
# (ignoring this package.json as it is not a part of the workspace).
# The workaround is to create a new workspace root.
