introduction: |-
  `tctl` is a CLI tool that allows a cluster administrator to manage all
  resources in a cluster, including nodes, users, tokens, certificates, and
  devices.

  `tctl` can also be used to modify the dynamic configuration of the cluster,
  such as creating new user roles or connecting to trusted clusters.

  For a conceptual overview of `tctl`, see [Getting Started with
  `tctl`](../../zero-trust-access/infrastructure-as-code/using-tctl.mdx).
