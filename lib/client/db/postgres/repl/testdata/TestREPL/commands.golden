Teleport PostgreSQL interactive shell (v19.0.0-dev)

Limitations: 
- Query cancellation is not supported. Once a query is sent, its execution
  cannot be canceled. Note that Teleport sends a terminate message to the database
  when the database session terminates. This flow doesn't guarantee that any
  running queries will be canceled.
  See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-TERMINATION for more details on the termination flow.
- Pressing CTRL-C will have no effect in this shell.
- All escaped delimiters (semicolons) must appear on the same line as the unescaped query delimiter.
- Commands cannot be used in the middle of a query.
