    "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 is a major release that brings the following new features.\r\n\r\nPlatform:\r\n\r\n* Passwordless (Preview)\r\n* Resource Access Requests (Preview)\r\n* Proxy Peering (Preview)\r\n\r\nServer Access:\r\n\r\n* IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)\r\n* Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)\r\n\r\nDatabase Access:\r\n\r\n* Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server Database Access\r\n* Snowflake Database Access (Preview)\r\n* ElastiCache/MemoryDB Database Access (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport Connect:\r\n\r\n* Teleport Connect for Server and Database Access (Preview)\r\n\r\nMachine ID:\r\n\r\n* Machine ID Database Access Support (Preview)\r\n\r\n### Passwordless (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 introduces passwordless support to your clusters. To use passwordless users may register a security key with resident credentials or use a built-in authenticator, like Touch ID.\r\n\r\nSee https://example.com/docs/access-controls/guides/passwordless/.\r\n\r\n### Resource Access Requests (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 expands just-in-time access requests to allow for requesting access to specific resources. This lets you grant users the least privileged access needed for their workflows.\r\n\r\nJust-in-time access requests are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.\r\n\r\n### Proxy Peering (Preview)\r\n\r\nProxy peering enables Teleport deployments to scale without an increase in load from the number of agent connections. This is accomplished by allowing Proxy Services to tunnel client connections to the desired agent through a neighboring proxy and decoupling the number of agent connections from the number of Proxies.\r\n\r\nProxy peering can be enabled with the following configurations:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nauth_service:\r\n  tunnel_strategy:\r\n    type: proxy_peering\r\n    agent_connection_count: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nproxy_service:\r\n  peer_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3021\r\n```\r\n\r\nNetwork connectivity between proxy servers to the `peer_listen_addr` is required for this feature to work.\r\n\r\nProxy peering is only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.\r\n\r\n### IP-Based Restrictions (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 introduces a new role option to pin the source IP in SSH certificates. When enabled, the source IP that was used to request certificates is embedded in the certificate, and SSH servers will reject connection attempts from other IPs. This protects against attacks where valid credentials are exfiltrated from disk and copied out into other environments.\r\n\r\nIP-based restrictions are only available in Teleport Enterprise Edition.\r\n\r\n### Automatic User Provisioning (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 can be configured to automatically create Linux host users upon login without having to use Teleport's PAM integration. Users can be added to specific Linux groups and assigned appropriate “sudoer” privileges.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about configuring automatic user provisioning read the guide: https://example.com/docs/server-access/guides/host-user-creation/.\r\n\r\n### Audit Logging for Microsoft SQL Server Database Access\r\n\r\nTeleport 9 introduced a preview of Database Access support for Microsoft SQL Server which didn’t include audit logging of user queries. Teleport 10 captures users' queries and prepared statements and sends them to the audit log, similarly to other supported database protocols.\r\n\r\nTeleport Database Access for SQL Server remains in Preview mode with more UX improvements coming in future releases.\r\n\r\nRefer to the guide to set up access to a SQL Server with Active Directory authentication: https://example.com/docs/database-access/guides/sql-server-ad/.\r\n\r\n### Snowflake Database Access (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 brings support for Snowflake to Database Access. Administrators can set up access to Snowflake databases through Teleport for their users with standard Database Access features like role-based access control and audit logging, including query activity.\r\n\r\nConnect your Snowflake database to Teleport following this guide: https://example.com/docs/database-access/guides/snowflake/.\r\n\r\n### Elasticache/MemoryDB Database Access (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport 9 added Redis protocol support to Database Access. Teleport 10 improves this integration by adding native support for AWS-hosted Elasticache and MemoryDB, including auto-discovery and automatic credential management in some deployment configurations.\r\n\r\nLearn more about it in this guide: https://example.com/docs/database-access/guides/redis-aws/.\r\n\r\n### Teleport Connect for Server and Database Access (Preview)\r\n\r\nTeleport Connect is a graphical macOS application that simplifies access to your Teleport resources. Teleport Connect 10 supports Server Access and Database Access. Other protocols and Windows support are coming in a future release.\r\n\r\nGet Teleport Connect installer from the macOS tab on the downloads page: https://example.com/download/.\r\n\r\n### Machine ID Database Access Support (Preview)\r\n\r\nIn Teleport 10 we’ve added Database Access support to Machine ID. Applications can use Machine ID to access databases protected by Teleport.\r\n\r\nYou can find Machine ID guide for database access in the documentation: https://example.com/docs/machine-id/guides/databases/.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\nPlease familiarize yourself with the following potentially disruptive changes in Teleport 10 before upgrading.\r\n\r\n#### Auth Service version check\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 agents will now refuse to start if they detect that the Auth Service is more than one major version behind them. You can use the `--skip-version-check` flag to bypass the version check.\r\n\r\nTake a look at component compatibility guarantees in the documentation: https://example.com/docs/setup/operations/upgrading/#component-compatibility.\r\n\r\n#### HTTP_PROXY for reverse tunnels\r\n\r\nReverse tunnel connections will now respect `HTTP_PROXY` environment variables. This may result in reverse tunnel agents not being able to re-establish connections if the HTTP proxy is set in their environment and does not allow connections to the Teleport Proxy Service.\r\n\r\nRefer to the following documentation section for more details: https://example.com/docs/setup/reference/networking/#http-connect-proxies.\r\n\r\n#### New APT repos\r\n\r\nWith Teleport 10 we’ve migrated to new APT repositories that now support multiple release channels, Teleport versions and OS distributions. The new repositories have been backfilled with Teleport versions starting from 6.2.31 and we recommend upgrading to them. The old repositories will be maintained for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nSee updated installation instructions: https://example.com/docs/server-access/getting-started/#step-14-install-teleport-on-your-linux-host.\r\n\r\n#### Removed “tctl access ls”\r\n\r\nThe `tctl access ls` command that returned information about user server access within the cluster was removed. Please use a previous `tctl` version if you’d like to keep using it.\r\n\r\n#### Relaxed session join permissions\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Teleport users needed full access to a Node/Kubernetes pod in order to join a session. Teleport 10 relaxes this requirement. Joining sessions remains deny-by-default but now only `join_policy` statements are checked for session join RBAC.\r\n\r\nSee the Moderated Sessions guide for more details: https://example.com/docs/access-controls/guides/moderated-sessions/.\r\n\r\n#### GitHub connectors\r\n\r\nThe GitHub authentication connector’s `teams_to_logins` field is deprecated in favor of the new `teams_to_roles` field. The old field will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n#### Teleport FIPS AWS endpoints\r\n\r\nTeleport 10 will now automatically use FIPS endpoints for AWS S3 and DynamoDB when started with the `--fips` flag. You can use the `use_fips_endpoint=false` connection endpoint option to use regular endpoints for Teleport in FIPS mode, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ns3://bucket/path?region=us-east-1&use_fips_endpoint=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the S3/DynamoDB backends documentation for more information: https://example.com/docs/setup/reference/backends/#s3.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nDownload the current and previous releases of Teleport at https://gravitational.com/teleport/download.",
