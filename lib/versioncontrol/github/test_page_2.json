[#13212](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13212)\r\n* Added support for automatic tags import when running on AWS EC2. [#12593](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12593)\r\n* Added ability to use multiple redirect URLs in OIDC connectors. [#13046](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13046)\r\n* Fixed issue with ANSI escape sequences being broken when using `tsh` on Windows. [#13221](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13221)\r\n* Fixed issue with `tsh ssh` printing extra error upon exit if last command was unsuccessful. [#12903](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12903)\r\n* Added support for Proxy Protocol v2 in MySQL proxy. [#12993](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/12993)\r\n* Upgraded to Go `v1.17.11`. [#13104](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13104)\r\n* Added Windows desktops labeling based on their LDAP attributes. [#13238](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13238)\r\n* Improved performance when listing resources for users with many roles. [#13263](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/13263)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nDownload the current and previous releases of Teleport at https://gravitational.com/teleport/download."
