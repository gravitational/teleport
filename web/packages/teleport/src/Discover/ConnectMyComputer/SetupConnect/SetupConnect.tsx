/**
 * usePollForConnectMyComputerNode polls for a Connect My Computer node that joined the cluster
 * after starting opening the SetupConnect step.
 *
 * The first polling request fills out a set of node IDs (initialNodeIdsRef). Subsequent requests
 * check the returned nodes against this set. The hook stops polling as soon as a node that is not
 * in the set was found.
 *
 * There can be multiple nodes matching the search criteria and we want the one that was added only
 * after the user has started the guided flow, hence why we need to keep track of the IDs in a set.
 *
 * Unlike the DownloadScript step responsible for adding a server, we don't have a unique ID that
 * identifies the node that the user added after following the steps from the guided flow. In
 * theory, we could make the deep link button pass such ID to Connect, but the user would still be
 * able to just launch the app directly and not use the link.
 *
 * Because of that, we must depend on comparing the list of nodes against the initial set of IDs.
