Teleport components emit audit events to record activity within the cluster. 

Audit event payloads have an \`event\` field that describes the event, which is
often an operation performed against a dynamic resource (e.g.,
\`access_list.create\` for the creation of an Access List) or some other user
behavior, such as a local user login (\`user.login\`). The \`code\` field
includes a string with pattern \`[A-Z0-9]{6}\` that is unique to an audit event,
such as \`TAP03I\` for the creation of an application resource.

In some cases, an audit event describes both a success state and a failure
state, while the \`event\` field is the same for both states. In this case, the
\`code\` field differs between states. For example, \`access_list.create\`
describes both successful and failed Access List creations, while the success
event has code \`TAL001I\` and the failure has code \`TAL001E\`. For other
events, like \`db.session.query.failed\` and \`db.session.query\`, the event
type describes only the success or failure state.

You can set up Teleport to export audit events to third-party services for
storage, visualization, and analysis. For more information, read [Exporting
Teleport Audit Events](
../admin-guides/management/export-audit-events/export-audit-events.mdx).`;
