# Gravitational Design System

This package contains the source code of Gravitational Design System

## Intro

As CSS-in-JS libraries matured and with the emergence of such great tools as
[storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), it became significantly easier and faster to
build UI components and design systems.

We looked at other design-systems and we realized that it's easier to
build it ourselves rather than trying to customize/override the third-party
components.

This design system has a limited feature set designed around Gravitational requirements.

This design system takes advantage of the two great libraries
[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
and [styled-system](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system).

Please refer to the following articles to get familiar with the general
concept and principles on which this design system is built.
