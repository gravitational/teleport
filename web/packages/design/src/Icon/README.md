## Adding an Icon to the Library

#### Steps:

1. Download the SVG file of the icon from Google Drive and rename it, ensuring that it is capitalized. This is the name that will be used in the app (eg. `ArrowBack.svg`).
   1. PLEASE NOTE: If you are looking at icons in Figma, _please contact the design team to get an 
      exported version_. All icons must be converted from vector lines to outlines in order to be 
      rendered correctly in the product. Exporting an icon without preparing it will cause 
      unpredictable rendering, such as the fill color not being updated or the entire shape being 
      filled in with color, rather than just the outlines.
2. Add the file to the `assets/` folder in this directory.
3. Run `$ yarn process-icons`.

A full collection of exported icons ready for download can be found in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19068OCcyob6iqjpY3JB4t2NGiRmnuw2D?usp=drive_link). The same icons and others that require preparation before exporting can be found [in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Gpjs9vjhzUKF1GDbeG9JGE/Application-Design-System?type=design&node-id=7371-35911&mode=design&t=ior9gA5q20atPjr9-0).
