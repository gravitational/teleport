    // Ideally, we'd like the not minimized window to receive focus too. We considered two
    // workarounds to bring focus to a window that's not minimized:
    //
    // * win.minimized() followed by win.focus() – this reportedly doesn't work anymore (see the
    // comment linked below) though it did work at the time of implementing forceFocusWindow.
    // Admittedly, this seems like a hack and does cause the window to first minimize and then show
    // up which feels weird.
    // * win.setAlwaysOnTop(true) followed by win.show() – this does bring the window to the top
    // but doesn't give it focus. Super awkward because Connect shows up over another app that you
    // were using, you start typing to fill out whatever form Connect has shown you. But your
    // keystrokes go to the app that the Connect window just covered.
    //
    // Since we cannot reliably steal focus, let's just not attempt to do it and instead defer to
    // flashing the icon in the task bar.
