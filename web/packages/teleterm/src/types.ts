/**
 * SubscribeToTshdEvent is a type of the subscribeToTshdEvent function which gets exposed to the
 * renderer through the context bridge.
 *
 * A typical implementation of a gRPC service looks something like this:
 *
 *     {
 *       nameOfTheRpc: (call, callback) => {
 *         call.onCancelled(() => { … })
 *         const request = call.request.toObject()
 *         // Do something with the request fields…
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * subscribeToTshdEvent lets you add a listener that's going to be called every time a client makes
 * a particular RPC to the tshd events service. The listener receives the request converted to a
 * simple JS object since classes cannot be passed through the context bridge.
 *
 * The SubscribeToTshdEvent type expresses all of this so that our subscribeToTshdEvent can stay
 * type safe.
