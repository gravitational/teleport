/**
 * TshdEventContextBridgeService is the part of the tshd events service running in the browser. It
 * is a version of ITshdEventsServiceServer with properties mapped to values that can be passed
 * through the context bridge.
 *
 * The tshd events gRPC service itself is set up in preload.ts. A typical implementation of a
 * handler for an RPC called "foo" of ITshdEventsServiceServer looks something like this:
 *
 * {
 *   foo: (call, callback) => {
 *     const result = processRequest(call.request)
 *     callback(null, new api.FooResponse().setBar(result.bar))
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * However, we want the actual logic of tshd event handlers to interact with UI elements in the app.
 * This means that the gRPC handlers need to run in the browser context, which in turns means that
 * the gRPC handlers need to call functions that cross the context bridge.
 *
 * grpc-js expects that `call.request` and the second argument to `callback` are class instances.
 * Unfortunately, class instances cannot be passed through the context bridge. This means that we
 * have to cast them to simple objects first.
 *
 * This means that the gRPC handler on the preload.ts side needs to do something like this:
 *
 * {
 *   foo: (call, callback) => {
 *     const result = processRequestInBrowser(call.request.toObject())
 *     callback(null, new api.FooResponse().setBar(result.bar))
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * â€¦so that the implementation of TshdEventContextBridgeService can look like this:
 *
 * {
 *   foo: async ({ request, onCancelled }) => {
 *     doSomething(request)
 *     return { bar: 1234 }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * The functions always need to return something, even if technically the handler is not going to
 * utilize the returned object. This helps with keeping type safety in cases where the handler
 * actually uses the returned object.
