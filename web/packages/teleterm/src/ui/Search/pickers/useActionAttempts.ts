   *
   * We're interested only in errors coming from clusters within the current workspace because
   * otherwise we'd nag the user to log in to each cluster they've added to the app.
   *
   * Technically we could wrap runResourceSearch into a custom promise which would make it fit into
   * retryWithRelogin. However, by doing this we'd give up some of the finer control over the whole
   * process, for example we couldn't as easily call pauseUserInteraction only when necessary.
   *
   * This logic _cannot_ be included within the callback passed to useAsync and has to be performed
   * outside of it. If it was included within useAsync, then this logic would fire for any request
   * made to the cluster, even for stale requests which are ignored by useAsync.
