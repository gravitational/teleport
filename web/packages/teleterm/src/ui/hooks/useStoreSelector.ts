 * useStoreSelector selects a value out of a store and triggers a component update whenever that

 *
 * The selector needs to have stable identity, i.e., the selector needs to return a piece of the
 * store state instead of creating a new object or an array on each invocation. For example, if you
 * need two separate pieces from the same store, call useStoreSelector twice with different
 * selectors instead of combining two pieces of state into a new object.
 *
 * @example
 * const isInitialized = useStoreSelector(
 *   'workspacesService',
 *   useCallback(state => state.isInitialized, [])
 * );
 *
 * @example
 * // Defined outside of a component.
 * const getIsInitialized = (selector: WorkspacesState) => state.isInitialized
 *
 * // Defined inside a React component.
 * () => {
 *   const isInitialized = useStoreSelector('workspacesService', getIsInitialized);
