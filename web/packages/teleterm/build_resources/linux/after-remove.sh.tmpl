# Do not touch symlinks if the package is being upgraded.
#
# Why?
#
# During an upgrade, RPM packages call after-install of new version first followed by after-remove
# of the old version. deb packages do this in reverse order. See README.md in this directory for
# more details.
#
# So, for RPM packages we should not remove the symlinks if the package is being upgraded, otherwise
# the user would end up with no symlinks after an upgrade.
#
# How?
#
# Both deb and RPM pass arguments to the scripts. rpm passes the number of packages of the given
# name which will be left on the system when the action completes. deb passes "upgrade" during an
# upgrade. We can check those args to determine if the package is being upgraded or removed.
