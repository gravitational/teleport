/**
 * useStateRef creates a piece of state and a ref reflecting a value of the state and a setter that

 * value of the state without making its identity dependent on the value of the state.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * const [isOpen, isOpenRef, setIsOpen] = useStateRef(false)
 *
 * const sendNotification = useCallback(() => {
 *   if (isOpenRef.current) {
 *     return;
 *   }
 *
 *   client.sendNotification(foo);
 * }, [client, foo]);
 *
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   setInterval(sendNotification, 5000);
 *
 *   return () => {
 *     // cleanup
 *   }
