/**
 * The Withholder class manages keyboard events, particularly for alt/cmd keys. It delays handling these keys to determine the user's intent:
 *
 * - For alt/cmd DOWN events, it waits to see if this is part of a normal operation or an alt/cmd + tab action. In the latter case, it cancels
 * the event to prevent the remote server from mistakenly thinking the key is held down when the user returns to the browser window, which can
 * cause issues as described in https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/24342.
 * - For alt/cmd UP events, it introduces a short delay before handling to avoid unintended actions (like opening the start menu), in the case
 * that an alt/cmd + tab registers both the alt/cmd DOWN and UP events in quick succession. (This can happen if the user does an alt/cmd + tab
 * really quickly, according to our testing.)
 * - For other keys, it handles them immediately.
 *
 * Events are either processed immediately, delayed, or cancelled based on user actions and focus changes.
